<a name="nott">Pakistan not to default on repayment of loans: Pasha</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: Expressing hope that the country would not 
default on repayment of foreign loans, the Prime Minister's adviser 
on finance, Dr Hafiz Pasha, told Dawn that Pakistan was seeking 
three types of trade financing from the Islamic Development Bank 
(IDB) and the members of the Islamic Consortium to improve its 
balance of payments position.
    
"The IDB board will meet on September 6 while the members of the 
Islamic Consortium have convened their meeting on September 9 to 
discuss and finalize the trade financing of about 1.5 billion 
dollars for Pakistan," he further stated.
    
Talking to this correspondent here on Thursday, the prime 
minister's adviser on finance expressed firm hope that Pakistan 
would pull through a very difficult period of its history. "We will 

not default. We will soon succeed in getting the economy back on 
the track," he assured.
    
Dr Pasha said Pakistan had sought: (1) trade financing from IDB; 
(2) import financing via Malaysia; and (3) a soft fund and the 
roll-over of some loans. He had received positive signals from IDB 
and other banks and financial institutions that Pakistan would get 
all of these, he said.
    
To another question, he said trade financing being sought from IDB 
had no linkage with the IMF. "We are having independent discussions 
with them," he informed.
    
Responding to a question, he said he would attend the meeting of 
the Islamic Consortium on Sept 9.
    
Hafiz Pasha chaired on Thursday a meeting of the Industrial Revival 
Committee which looked into individual sectors to revive them. 
Cement, sugar besides other sectors came up for discussion in that 
meeting, he said. "Now the government has to decide how much 
capital it could pump into these industries to revive them," he 
said, adding that another meeting was scheduled for Sunday to 
finalize various issues relating to the sick industrial units. 
"Without their revival, it would be difficult to achieve the 
objective of increased production and ultimately achieving self 
sufficiency in every sector," he said.
    
"We are considering to offer more incentives for enhancing our 
exports," he said, adding that new incentives would be given in the 
light of the economic revival package announced on July 31.

<a name="indi">Pakistan-India talks prospects dim, says envoy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Aug 13: The prospects of bilateral talks between India 
and Pakistan are "very very dim", Pakistan Ambassador to 
Washington, Riaz Khokhar said on Wednesday.
    
Speaking at a conference jointly organised by the Indiana 
University of Illinois and Pakistani American Congress on the 
Capitol Hill, the Ambassador said every dispute between the two 
countries had been resolved in the past through third party 
mediation and Kashmir issue could not be resolved without the 
international community joining in.
    
His comments were interpreted by observers as an indication of 
pessimism in the forthcoming talks between Pakistani and Indian 
prime ministers in Durban, South Africa where they will gather for 
the NAM summit.
    
The two leaders will also meet at New York for the UN General 
Assembly session and are likely to see President Clinton as well, 
provided he survived the present troubles connected with the Monica 
Lewinsky affair.
    
The conference was also addressed by famous writer and scholar 
Stanley Wolport who flew in from California and several other 
Pakistani and Indian scholars, including one representing the 
Kashmiri Hindu pundits.
    
The conference was telecast live throughout the USA by C-Span, a 
public service channel paid for by all cable channel networks. C-
Span normally carries live the proceedings of the US Senate and 
House of Representatives.
    
Dr. Nisar Choudhry of the Pakistan American Congress organised the 
conference on the Hill and announced that similar conferences would 
be held at Islamabad and New Delhi in future as well.
    
Mr Khokhar traced the history of Pakistan-India relations, as he 
was until recently the Pakistani envoy to New Delhi, and said there 
was lack of will in New Delhi to resolve the issue, although the 
foreign secretaries of the two countries had last year laid a sound 
basis to proceed through the working groups.
    
Prof Stanley Wolport, who recently returned from Indian occupied 
Kashmir, said the Kashmiri people had no trust in the Indian army 
and the Indian government.
    
He narrated the story of his visit and said from his hotel to the 
airport, he was stopped five times by Indian army check points. 
When he asked his Indian hosts why there was so much insecurity, he 
was told that the Indian army units did not trust each other and 
every unit had to make its own security checks.
    
"When the Indian army does not trust its own fellow soldiers, how 
can the Kashmiri people trust the army," Prof Wolport asked, 
stressing that the issue had to be resolved through international 
involvement and pressure because it threatened the entire world.

<a name="mutt">Muttahida quits federal cabinet to protest killings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 14: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement quit the federal 
government on Friday in protest against on-going killings in the 
city.
    
The MQM informed the visiting minister for provincial coordination, 
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, during more than two hours of talks at the 
Nine Zero, that its sole member in the federal cabinet, Dr Khalid 
Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for industries and production, had 
tendered his resignation in protest against "unabated killing of 
MQM workers", the North Nazimabad tragedy, helplessness of the 
government to stop MQM workers'murder, remaining of the killers at 
large and PML's failure to implement agreements and assurances.
    
The decision to quit the federal cabinet was taken by the 
Coordination Committee at its emergency meeting held at the Nine 
Zero soon after the brutal killing of 10 MQM workers on Wednesday 
night in North Nazimabad by" government agencies and terrorists on 
their pay rolls."
    
In the light of this decision, Dr Siddiqui resigned from the 
cabinet on Friday and this was communicated to Chaudhry Nisar when 
the latter visited Nine Zero along with Chief Minister Liaquat Ali 
Jatoi on Friday.
    
Dr Siddiqui, who is in London these days after an official visit to 
the US, informed Chaudhry Nisar by phone at the Nine Zero :" I am 
talking to you as a former federal minister. Please inform Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif about my decision to resign and that I will 
formally submit my resignation to him on returning home."

Dr Siddiqui's withdrawal from the federal cabinet could be a 
prelude to quitting of the coalition in the province by the MQM.
    
Sources said the MQM had given 48 hours to the government to honour 
its commitments, failing which it might quit the provincial 
government as well.

<a name="sena">Senate session: Opposition plans bill on more autonomy </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M.Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Aug 9: All opposition parties in the senate have agreed 
to jointly table a private bill in the next regular session of the 
upper house to amend the constitution so as to enhance the quantum 
of provincial autonomy.
    
As many as 52 members are said to have promised to vote for the 
bill, which would leave the government with only 35 to oppose the 
proposed amendment in a house of 87. However, the opposition still 
needs to muster the support of another six members to get the bill 
passed in the upper house.
    
Meanwhile, informed sources said Mr Hasil Bizenjo, a BNP (rebel 
group) MNA from Balochistan, has been promised the federal cabinet 
slot of railways, recently vacated by Mr Yaqub Nasir.
    
Sources said Bizenjo would, however, get the slot only after a new 
government was installed in Balochistan, perhaps as a reward for 
helping the Muslim League regain a foothold in the province.
    
One of the three BNP MNAs, three of the five senators and seven of 
the 10 MPAs are reported to have formed a dissident group, led by 
Senator Sanaullah Khan Zehri and MNA Hasil Bizenjo. This leaves the 
leader of the party, Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal, with two MNAs, 
two senators and three MPAs.
    
The rebel group has a total of 11 parliamentarians, while the group 
belonging to Sardar Mengal has seven.
    
Since it is still not very clear which of the two groups can expel 
the other group, the formation of a stable and strong government in 
Balochistan continues to appear uncertain.

<a name="janj">Jan Jamali elected leader of the house</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi and Saleem Shahid

QUETTA, Aug 13: Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali of Pakistan Muslim 
League was on Thursday elected the leader of the house in 
Balochistan Assembly and chief minister of the province. He secured 
29 votes in a house of 41 members.
    
His only rival, Prince Musa Jan of Balochistan National Party 
(headed by Sardar Ataullah Mengal) got only four votes. Musa had 
filed nomination at the last moment on Thursday.
    
Nawab Akbar Bugti's Jamhoori Watan Party (JWP) abstained from 
voting. None of its seven members turned up in the afternoon 
session when balloting was held in the assembly. Independent member 
Hair Byar Marri was present in the house but did not cast his vote.
    
Mir Jan Jamali got 11 votes of his own party (the PML), 6 votes of 
the breakaway BNP group, 7 votes of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, two votes 
of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, two votes of Balochistan National 
Movement and the only vote of the Pakistan People's Party member.
    
The PPP member, Bismillah Khan Kakar, was also one of the four 
proposers who signed Jan Jamali's nomination paper. Others who 
proposed Jan Jamali's name for the leader of the house were Malik 
Sarwar Khan Kakar of PML, Maulana Amir Zaman of JUI and Sardar 
Bahadur Khan Bungalzai of the BNP breakaway group.
    
In the morning session, the Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly Mir 
Abdul Jabbar informed the members of the rules of the election and 
invited nomination papers till 1:30pm.
    
The polling began at 3:00pm and was over by 3:40pm. Soon 
afterwards, the speaker announced the result and declared Mir Jan 
Jamali elected as the leader of the House.
    
In his opening remarks after being declared elected, the new leader 
of the House said he would present his agenda in the assembly on 
Saturday when he would seek vote of confidence from the members.
    
He regretted that in the previous era Balochistan's social fabric 
was torn apart and centuries old tribal and traditional 
relationships broken down.
    
Mir Jan Jamali said he wanted to give the province a new working 
system that should keep functioning even after he was not there in 
the office of chief minister. To bring about these changes in the 
province, the chief minister sought assistance of his own party, 
the coalition partners, all the members of the Balochistan Assembly 
and the people of the province.
    
The outgoing chief minister, Akhtar Mengal, offered all cooperation 
to the new chief minister, Jan Jamali, in the interest of the 
province and said the future would be the best judge of the 
performance of his as well as Jan Jamali's government. He said he 
would offer his comments after Jan Jamali spelled out his 
government's programme on Saturday.
    
Abdul Rahim Mandokhel of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) urged 
the newly elected chief minister to resolve the issue of the rights 
of the Pakhtun and the Baloch in the province. He complained that 
the Pakhtun members in the PML or JUI were not given major 
responsibilities. He hoped that the new government would give due 
importance to the province-federation relationship.
    
Maulana Amir Zaman, whose party JUI decided late on Wednesday night 
to support Jan Jamali, said the party decision was based on 
principles.
    
He said the JUI wanted the new government to strive for restoring 
Islamic provisions given in the framework of the constitution.
    
Others who spoke in the session were Bismillah Khan Kakar of PPP, 
Bahadur Khan Bungalzai of the BNP breakaway group, Abdul Karim 
Nausherwani of BNM and Jaffer Khan Mandokhel of PML.

<a name="bena">Benazir calls for formation of national govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Aug 13: Former prime minister and Leader of the 
Opposition in the National Assembly Ms Benazir Bhutto said here on 

Thursday that it was very important for Pakistan to have a national 
government, made up of all major political parties and their allies 
in view of the current situation in the region.
    
"This national government must adopt a national agenda," she said 
while speaking at a press conference.
    
She said Mian (Nawaz Sharif) Sahib should tender his resignation 
for the national government because the country was more dear than 
him. "If he (Nawaz Sharif) can submit resignation for the sake of a 
former president (Ghulam Ishaque Khan) then why not this time," she 
said asserting that Nawaz Sharif had shattered the unity of the 
nation, which was created after the nuclear blasts.
    
"He cannot unite the nation now," she asserted.
    
Benazir Bhutto said the country was facing an internal threat more 
than an external threat and was in dire need of internal unity.
    
Asked to elaborate the format of the national government, Ms Bhutto 
said she would state it in Pakistan and would talk about Kashmir 
today.
    
Ms Bhutto said she did not believe that the present leadership of 
Pakistan had understanding of the dimensions of the challenges the 
subcontinent was facing today while replying to another question.
    
"I don't believe that the present leadership understands the 
dimensions of the challenges that today face the subcontinent," she 
said.
    
AJK Prime Minister Sultan Mahmood Choudhry, senior minister Ishaque 
Zafar, PPAK's secretary general and forests minister, Choudhry 
Latif Akbar, former federal minister, Syed Iftikhar Gilani, Ms 
Naheed Khan and some other AJK ministers were also present on the 
occasion.
    
Ms Bhutto was here on a brief visit to meet the Kashmiris, 
displaced by Indian firing in Neelam Valley.

<a name="6mem">6-member body to reform agriculture department</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahmad Hassan

PESHAWAR, Aug 14: The NWFP chief minister, Sardar Mahtab Ahmed 
Khan, on Thursday formed a 6-member committee to chalk out 
proposals for restructuring the agriculture department. 
    
The committee to be headed by a former chief secretary Azam Khan 
has been asked to submit its report within two months.
    
Speaking at a meeting on Thursday, Mahtab said, he was keen to 
launch a campaign to help farmers from the next Rabi season and the 
restructuring of the department must be completed before that time.
    
Keeping in view the mismanagement in the department, he said the 
job description must be re-defined for its each official, he 
emphasised.
    
The committee will comprise provincial secretaries of Finance and 
Planning and development departments, an ex-M.D. of fruit and 
vegetable board Manzar Elahi Raja, G.M.Khan, an ex-vice chancellor, 
Agriculture University and researcher Qazi Mohammad Hanif.
    
The chief minister regretted that although agriculture was the 
mainstay of 60 to 70% of population', they do not get any support 
from the government agencies. The meeting was informed that three 
different expert committees were working in this connection and 
their reports are expected shortly. The steps taken for giving 
autonomous and self sustainable status to research, specially the 
seed production have shown positive results within a short span of 
time.
    
Presently, the Agriculture department has a vast network including 
research, extension, engineering, livestock, water management, 
veterinary, fruits and vegetable, information and marketing which 
need total restructuring for improving its efficiency, the meeting 
was told.

<a name="mill">Millat Party: Creation of egalitarian society basic objective</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Aug 14: Ex-president Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari 
formally launched his Millat Party at a founding convention here on 
Friday declaring the creation of an egalitarian society based on 
universal human rights and Islamic principles as its basic 
objective.

"We are not disappointed even at this critical state of national 
affairs," Mr Leghari declared at the convention held at a five-star 
hotel, because, he said, his party believed that empowerment of the 
people, a genuine federal structure and a comprehensive package of 
micro and macro-economic policies finalized by his party would 
solve most of the country's socio-economic problems.

Speakers at the convention, which was attended by over 2,000 
invited delegates from all over the country, asserted that there 
was a political vacuum after major parties like the PPP and the PML 
had failed to perform. The people were frustrated and wanted a 
change but had no alternative. The speakers said they believed that 
the Millat Party was qualified to be the third party in the 
country.

Mr Leghari, who will be the president of the new party, said a 
change was in the offing as the federation was in danger, the 
country was on the brink of an economic disaster and successive 
rulers had distorted the system to a degree that any further delay 
to salvage Pakistan would be fatal. "We have to bring about a basic 
change in the system and retrieve all the ill-gotten money from 
abroad, no matter if we have to publicly punish rulers and their 
corrupt allies," he said amidst applause from the gathering.

The Millat Party at present consists mostly of PPP old guard who 
had gone into political isolation. Also included are some former 
legislators and those who were associated with the caretaker 
government between November 1996 and February 1997.

Though participants came from all the four provinces, Azad Kashmir, 
FATA and Northern Areas, a big majority of them hails from the 
southern parts of the Punjab, Mr Leghari's own feudal and political 
base. Some PPP(SB) leaders who decided on Thursday to part ways 
with Ms Ghinwa Bhutto did not attend the convention in what was 
seen as a "strategic move", but are expected to join up later. Many 
delegates representing the minority communities were also invited 
to the convention. A large number of women also attended.

Some of the important participants included former Punjab ministers 
Malik Abdul Qayyum, former legislators Riaz Husain Pirzada, Arif 
Zaman Qureshi, Husain Jahanian Gardezi, Tahira Khan, Malik Shah 
Muhammad Mohsin, Pervez Saleh, MPA Rafiq Leghari, Syed Vilayat 
Husain Gardezi, publisher Agha Amir Husain and the sons of Malik 
Meraj Khalid and Muhammad Haneef Ramay.

The convention adopted the party's constitution which promises 
election at all tiers of the organization. A 300-member national 
council will be responsible for the party's constitutional affairs 
and a 50-member national executive council will be its policy-
making body. The constitution, presented by former PPP federal 
minister Qayyum Nizami, envisages setting up primary units to 
promote membership at the lowest tier of the organization.

According to the constitution, the first election at all tiers will 
be held in about 15 months. The party's membership drive, which was 
kicked off by Mr Leghari by filling the first form at the 
convention, will last for one year and elections will be held 
within three months after that. In the meantime, the party 
president will nominate members to various bodies.

After the constitution was adopted, Sakhe Qabool Muhammad Siddiqui, 
Sajjada Nashin of Dargah Hazrat Sachal Sarmast in Sindh, proposed 
the name of Mr Farooq Leghari for the office of the president which 
was unanimously approved by the convention.

The Millat Party leader said the time was near when everything 
would be demolished. The rulers had run out of time, and even the 
assemblies seemed to have completed their "logical" term as their 
members had been made deaf and dumb after the 14th amendment. The 
rulers had run the federation like a personal fiefs as a result of 
which the federal system was under major threat.

<a name="tran">Transporters indefinite strike from Aug 27</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 10: Transporters have called an indefinite wheel-jam 
strike from Aug 27, while criticising the indifferent attitude of 
the government towards issues being faced by the transport sector.
    
Different transport bodies in separate statements issued here on 
Monday said that they were aware of the hardships that the people 
had to face owing to the strikes, but there was no other way to get 
the government's attention so that the problems could be solved.
    
The transporters have also urged the owners of motor cars, 
scooters, motor cycles and other petrol run vehicles to join hands 
with them and observe the strike, as they were also the sufferers 
of the enhancement in petrol prices.
    
They criticised the Sindh government's attitude and said that after 
the transporters in Punjab gave a strike call for Aug 8, Punjab 
Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif called them for a meeting and solved 
their problems, but here the government remained unmoved.

They also criticised the recent decision taken about handing over 
of the bus terminals to the NGOs. Claiming it a conspiracy against 
the transporters, they said no such procedure prevailed in any 
other city.
    
Pointing out that the students were not being given any concession 
on the recently inaugurated route (4-B), they said if the facility 
was not extended to the students, all other buses, plying on North 
Naziamabad route, would also withdraw such facility.
    
They also criticised the establishment of the Karachi Public 
Transport Society and alleged that it would harm the transport 
sector. The transporters have also offered the government that if 
their problems could not be solved, their buses and other vehicles 
be purchased by the government.
    
The demands of the transports are: withdrawal of 25 per cent 
enhancement in petrol prices; immediate payment of compensation of 
the vehicles burnt owing to law and order situation; withdrawal of 
enhancement in various taxes and duties, withdrawal of enhancement 
in spare parts; extortion by police; etc.
    
The Karachi Transport Federation chief, Saleem Khan Bangish, while 
talking to Dawn, said the provincial government had offered the 
transporters to revise the fares, but the transporters did not 
agree as they do not want that further victimise the poor people.
    
He said that federal Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar and Prime 
Minister's adviser Najam-us-Saqib had called and informed them that 
the government would solve their problems, but the transporters 
refused to accept the verbal assurances and demanded that their 
demands be accepted first. The minister had assured him of a 
meeting in Karachi in a few days.
    
He said that it was surprising that the petrol prices in the 
international markets were going down, while here the government 
was increasing the prices.

<a name="sale">Sales tax, duties exemptions likely</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haq

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: A number of new exemptions, related to sales tax 
and customs duties are currently being planned by the government to 
substantially increase exports, particularly with a view to counter 
the effects of the international sanctions against Pakistan.
    
Official sources told Dawn here on Wednesday that the ministry of 
commerce has finalized a set of proposals to offer new exemptions 
which will certainly help achieve $10 billion exports target during 
1998-99.
    
Sources said the Minister for Commerce, Ishaq Dar had assured the 
prime minister that new measures would greatly facilitate the 
exporters to compete with the exporters of China, India and Sri 
Lanka. 
    
"We have tried to remove some of the anomalies which will ensure 
increased exports to USA, Europe and Middle East", said an 
official.

Responding to a question he said that changes have been proposed in 
the Sales Tax Act to the satisfaction of the exporters and other 
traders. Likewise, he said that some of the custom duties will be 
reduced to achieve the objective of having more exports.
    
Sources said that the government has also decided to issue a number 
of much awaited SROs contained in the new trade policy. The CBR, 
sources said, has been advised to urgently issue SROs related to 
sales tax.
    
"The 50 per cent export proceeds given to the exporters have gone 
well and initial reports are very encouraging", said an official.
    
Furthermore, the role of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) was 
being made effective to increase exports. Sources said that a 
decision has been taken that the EPB will monitor the performance 
of the new commercial counsellors. It will monitor and evaluate the 
performance of commercial counsellors and those who were not 
performing satisfactorily, will be recalled.
    
These commercial counsellors were being given a special assignment 
to ensure more Pakistani exports by finding out new areas in their 
respective countries where they were serving. They were being asked 
to cooperate with the Pakistani exporters and in case there were 
complaints against them, they would be recalled immediately.
    
It was also learnt that the ministry of commerce has decided to 
induct equal number of commercial counsellors from the private 
sector. And as a first step two MBAs from the private sector have 
been appointed as the new commercial counsellors in China and 
Spain. Another two from the ministry of commerce were being sent to 
Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh.
    
"A number of commercial counsellors who will complete their tenure 
at the end of this year will not be given any extension and new 
people will be appointed in their place", said an official of the 
ministry of commerce.
    
He said the ministry of commerce wanted to appoint new commercial 
counsellors at all the important places but it could not do so 
because of the recommendations of former Secretary Foreign Affairs 
Shayaryar Yar Khan to curtail the number of counsellors including 
the commercial counsellors and press counsellors.

<a name="offe">Offer to cut power rates</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 8: Habibullah Coastal, an independent power producer 
(IPP) having a capacity of 123mw has offered to reduce tariffs to 
4.8 cent per unit, provided its gas allocation is increased to 30 
years and capacity production to 75 per cent, a director of the 
project told Dawn. Habibullah Coastal is among the six IPPs which 
had been issued cancellation of letter of intent by the ministry of 
water and power in June this year.
    
Habibullah Coastal is a joint venture between Habibullah family and 
an American Company Coastal Energy. 
    
The project was identified and sanctioned in the last government of 
Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif.

Federal Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Chaudhry Nisar 
Ali Khan who was holding the same portfolio in the previous 
government had approved the gas allocation for a period of 20 years 
for the project.
    
In the power policy of 1994 the project along with other IPPs had 
been offered a tariff of 6.5 cent at a production capacity of 60 
per cent.
    
The company in its reply to the cancellation of letter of intent 
had denied allegation of corruption or involvement of any kick-
backs in the project.
    
"How can they level such allegations when the project was approved 
by them," said the source on the request of anonymity.
    
He recalled that the project was originally conceived by WAPDA and 
even the site was selected by the its experts. 
    
Later on the World Bank's refusal to extend loan to WAPDA. The bank 
had asked the government of Pakistan to offer this project to some 
private investors.
    
The project was then offered to Saeedullah Khan Piracha, who 
accepted it despite serious drawbacks and some technical 
constraints, the source said.

<a name="25bi">$2.5 billion FCY deposits encashed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Aug 10: Some $2.533 billion worth of frozen foreign 
currency deposits have been converted into rupees reducing the 
total deposits from about $11 billion on May 28 to $8.5 billion on 
August 8, 1998. The conversion created Rs 116.518 billion worth of 
rupee funds a major of chunk of which is believed to have gone out 
of the banking system.
    
Senior bankers told Dawn the conversion at the rate of Rs 46 per 
dollar had initially put their rupee resources under severe 
pressure. They said the situation improved later on as the banks 
managed to attract the converted funds into tailor-made rupee 
deposit schemes.
    
Bankers said the pace of conversion slowed after July 21 when the 
government withdrew the August 31 deadline earlier set for 
conversion of these deposits.
    
Now people can convert their frozen FCY deposits into rupees or 
dollar-bonds whenever they want. That is why people are no more in 
hurry to convert their deposits. This is evident from the fact that 
during July 22-August 8, 1998 only $400 million worth of deposits 
have been converted into rupees against $2.1 billion converted 
during May 29-July 21, 1998.
    
The July 21 economic package had it that people would continue to 
enjoy wealth tax exemption and exemption from disclosing the source 
of funds if they converted their FCY deposits into rupees. The 
package also promised withholding tax exemption on converted funds 
if redeposited with the banks.
    
"It is because of these decisions that the holders of frozen 
foreign currency deposits are no more in a hurry to convert them 
into rupees," said treasury manager of a foreign bank. His 
assessment was that people had adopted a wait-and-see policy with 
regard to their frozen FCY deposits.
   
"People might be anticipating a devaluation of rupee so that they 
could get more through the conversion of the FCY deposits," said 
another bank treasurer. This possibility cannot be ruled out 
because people converting their FCY accounts into rupees are still 
getting Rs 46 per dollar which is far below its prevailing 
composite price.
    
The State Bank composite price of the dollar based on buying and 
selling prices of some 16 selected banks stood at Rs 49.95 for 
buying and Rs 50.32 for selling on Monday.
    
The SBP composite exchange rate truly reflects the actual strength 
of the rupee because of the way it is worked out. SBP had fixed the 
official buying and selling price of dollar at Rs 46 and Rs 46.46 
on June 27 by devaluing the rupee by 4.4 per cent. Before that the 
buying and selling price stood at Rs 44.05 and Rs 44.49. If the SBP 
composite rates that have been in place since August 1 are compared 
with the official exchange rate of Rs 46 for buying and Rs 46.46 
for selling it shows a devaluation of 8.30 per cent.
    
Under the dual exchange rates system currently in practice banks 
are free to quote their own exchange rates based upon the demand 
and supply situation in the market. These rates are called floating 
inter-bank rates and are used for buying and selling dollars in the 
inter-bank market including the State Bank. These rates do not 
apply to bank customers. They buy and sell dollars at what is 
called composite rate. Composite rate is the average of official 
exchange rate and floating rate of the bank concerned.

<a name="trad">Trade deficit shrinks to $118m: Sharp drop in exports, imports</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: Pakistan opened the financial year 1998-99 with 
a sharp reduction in exports and imports but with the silver lining 
that the trade deficit was restricted to $118.0 million in July 
1998. In June, 1998, it had stood at $213.1 million.
    
The Federal Bureau of Statistics this time released the monthly 
statement of foreign trade statistics in Pakistani rupee only 
because they said the State Bank of Pakistan had not provided the 
rupee-dollar conversion rate.
    
On the basis of official rate of Rs46.0548 per dollar, Pakistan's 
mercantile exports totalled $585.75 million (Rs26.977 billion) in 
July, while imports amounted to about $703.84 million (Rs32.415 
billion).
    
The trade policy announced by the commerce minister envisaged 
exports worth $10 billion. On this basis, the exports in the first 
month of the year should have been $833.33 million but it is short 
of the same by 29.7%. On the imports side, the situation seems to 
be satisfactory in terms of the government policy which wants to 
minimize imports and thereby, the balance of payments deficit. In 
July, it is short of the projection of imports worth $11 billion in 
the whole year by 23.21%.
    
The exports of all the major categories, namely primary 
commodities, the textile group and "other manufactures" depressed 
the exports. The former registered an astounding 32.55% drop over 
July 1997. The exports of primary commodities totalled $51.069 
million as against $75.717 million in the corresponding month of 
last year. Rather unexpected is the decline in exports of rice and 
raw cotton. Their exports are shown to have declined by 37.98% and 
97.99%, respectively over July 1997. Yet, in the latter month, 
their exports had increased by 41.5% and 5747%, respectively in 
rupees.
    
In quantitative terms also, the export of rice plummeted by 56.2% 
from 86,575 tons in July 1997 to 37,860 tons last month. In July 
last year, Pakistan exported 5087 tons of raw cotton; last month, 
it dwindled to 92 tons.
    
Nevertheless, the month under report stands out for substantial 
jump in the export of fruits and vegetables. Their exports totalled 
24,312 tons and 13,026 tons, respectively. In July 1997, their 
exports stood at 25,004 tons and 316 tons, respectively. It 
appears, however, that the vegetables were exported at grossly 
reduced rates. This contrasts with fruits which fetched much higher 
unit price, compared to the corresponding month of last year.
    
Textile group: In rupee terms, exports are shown to have increased 
by 1.96% over July last year. However, in dollar terms, their 
exports amounting to $406.84 million were lower by 2.9%. In 
quantitative terms, a sizable drop of 5.81% has been admitted in 
the statistics.
    
Last month, the quantity of cotton yarn exported totalled 33,659 
tons, which is 14.24% lower than the corresponding month of last 
year. The unit price at which it was exported also declined, as 
evident from the fact that in rupees, exports of cotton yarn 
decreased by 16.42%.
    
The items which showed positive growth last month were knitwear, 
bedwear, towels, readymade garments and waste material of textile 
fibres. Their exports increased in quantity, respectively, by 
5.14%, 39.64%, 26.31%, 56.11% and 4.89%.
    
Exports in the category "Other Manufactures" dropped by 37.23% in 
rupee terms and by about 1% in dollar terms. This category's 
exports totalled $53.93 million as against 54.45 million in July 
last year. All the items in this category except carpets and 
chemicals showed positive growth in exports.
    
The exports of sports goods, in rupee terms, declined by 72.15%, 
leather manufactures by 20.53%, surgical & medical instruments by 
69.12% and cutlery by 76.32%. Only the miscellaneous group stands 
out for its plus performance by more than doubling its exports from 
$36.46 million to &73.91 million.
    
Imports: Last month posted an impressive 21.73% drop in imports in 
dollar terms from $899.3 million in July 1997 to $703.83 million. 
Compared to June, 1998, the exports declined by 11.14%. This is 
attributable to a reduction in imports of Food Group from $198.09 
million in July 1997 to $87.48 million last month. In this group, 
imports of wheat, palm oil and sugar decreased. 
    
But the import of soyabean oil increased from 8,961 tons in July 
last year to 11,225 tons in July 1998, raising the import bill from 

$5.63 million to $8.0 million.
    
Substantial increase is also reported in import of milk & cream 
etc, tea and spices. In quantitative terms, their imports 
increased, respectively, by 61.72%,9.49% and 105.1%.
    
Besides, the machinery group, which continues as the biggest import 
group, registered about 26% drop in imports from $222.62 million in 
July 1997 to $165.67 million last month.
    
The imports of petroleum group declined quite substantially, from 
$174.70 million to $102.16 million.

<a name="stee">Pakistan Steel's performance improved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: Pakistan Steel Mills has achieved "break-even" 
between its current expenditures and earnings notwithstanding the 
past accumulative liabilities of over Rs14 billion, Director 
Finance Shakeel Mirza said on Tuesday.
    
"Had this foreign exchange crisis not been there the PS would have 
made profits this year," Mirza said claiming that he had reversed 
the financial position of it through a set of corrective measures 
introduced in the past one year.
    
The losses which had been recorded at Rs2.5 billion in the year 
1996-97 were brought down to Rs1.67 billion in the year 1997-98, he 
said.
    
The present management reduced the losses by curtailing the 
procurements cost by 40 per cent, reduction in personnel-related 
cost by 19 per cent, putting a ceiling on the overtime, cutting the 
transportation cost and improving the material consumption ratio.
    
In actual terms the purchase expenditures have been reduced by over 
80 per cent, if the inflation, rupees deprecation and certain other 
factors were also taken into account, he said.
 
The annual purchase bill of Pakistan Steel contained over of 51,000 
different items including raw materials and spares, he added. The 
overtime of drivers has been reduced from 39,000 hours a month to 
8000 hours a month, he said.
    
The new management reduced the ceiling of overtime from 200 hours 
to 40 hours, besides decreasing the medical allowance from Rs1000 a 
month to Rs500 a month, he said.
 
The mills, he said, also saved a considerable amount by improving 
material consumption ratio. The management introduced cheap 
substitute materials and reduced the ratio of expensive raw 
materials. It had been done without compromising the quality of the 
products, he added.
    
In view of the over-staffing problem being faced by the mills, he 
said, he introduced a scheme encouraging the employees to take 
premature retirement. Under the new scheme any employee can apply 
three-year leave on half salary before the retirement, he said.
    
The mills had received over 1400 applications and these were being 
processed so that it would not lose trained manpower, he added.
    
A new scheme to encourage savings has also been introduced under 
which an officer can get 50 per cent of the amount saved by him by 
curtailing his telephone bills and petrol quota.

"If an officer has a ceiling of Rs2000 for his telephone bill and 
he reduces his bill by Rs1000 he can get Rs500 out of it as a 
reward," he said.
    
Mirza calling for immediate expansion. Though it had the production 
capacity of 1.1 million tons but it only once touched the figure of 
1 million tons. 
    
Regarding the past liabilities of Rs14 billion, he said, the mills 
was not in a position to pay back these liabilities or even service 
these debts. Only the interest of these loans was over Rs1.6 
billion a year.
    
He said he had prepared a three-pronged strategy including the 
financial restructuring or rescheduling of loans outstanding 
against the mills of five commercial banks. A comprehensive 
balancing modernization and rehabilitation programme was also 
included in the strategy to reverse the financial health of PS.
    
Calling for an urgent expansion, he said, he had asked the 
government to provide required funds for enhancing the production 
capacity from 1.1 million tons to three million tons.
    
Mirza also expressed serious reservations over the anomalies in 
taxes and tariffs. "The mills can earn huge amount if it is saved 
from anomalies in the tax and tariffs," he said.
 
He pointed that the mills was paying Rs4 million a year on account 
of different taxes.
    
He cited an specific example to corroborate his complaint about the 
anomalies in taxes. Central Board of Revenue deducted Rs630 million 
on account of excise duty, which he said was challenged by the 
mills in the Sindh High Court. The court gave verdict in favour of 
the mills but even then CBR did not repay the amount wrongfully 
deducted by it. He appealed to the CBR authorities to adjust this 
amount against the future taxes if they were not in a position to 
refund the amount to the mills.

<a name="cbrf">CBR faces uphill task in reviving fixed tax</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The Central Board of Revenue is faced with a 
difficult job of implementing the agreement for reintroducing the 
Fixed Tax Scheme and Trade Enrolment Scheme, sources said.
    
Tariq Iqbal, Member Tax Policy told Dawn on Wednesday that the 
issue was not as simple as it was deemed to be. "We will have to 
see how to evolve a mechanism to enforce a tax collection system 
and how to make such a mechanism fit into the law", he said.
    
When his attention was drawn to the fact that the entire chain of 
GST extraction was at threat if the retailers/jewellers were taken 
out as special segments to deposit ST through FST/TEC, he said 
"this is the problem we are facing". He added "it would take longer 
than it is being thought to take, and it is more complicated an 
issue than it has been taken for, put in the backdrop of the 
Finance Act 1998 and the contents of the agreement. We are not 
running away from the agreement as it is, but it is not so simple."
    
On the other hand, distributors of general products and merchants 
of a range of imported and locally-produced items have approached 
the CBR against the very decision to allow payment of sales tax 
through TECs and the FTS. 
    
The general product distributors, especially those licensed to 
market the products of multinationals in Pakistan and merchants of 
a vast range of items like paper and paper products, have begun 
campaigning against the impending notification on TECs/FTS.
    
They maintain, "we are to collect sales tax at the rate of 12.5 per 
cent from the retailers, deposit it, along with the sales money 
with our producers and thus pay it up as registered ST payees. How 
can we pay ST if the retailer has a TEC and says he is not supposed 
to pay at the rate of 12.5 per cent?" said a representative of 
distributors from the Punjab while struggling to have an audience 
with the CBR officials to plead his case.
    
The distributors explained to the CBR on Tuesday that they are 
supposed to be registered as ST payees, which is a condition not 
only inherent in the system of the tax for an operator as 
distributor, but also is a compulsion from the producers 
(multinationals) who do not issue licence for an agent distributor 
without the latter being a registered ST payee.
    
However, they pleaded, if the CBR allows retailers of general 
products to pay ST at fixed rate, or through TECs, there would be 
no chance for the distributors to collect the ST which they are 
supposed to deposit with the return which they are bound by law to 
file.

KARACHI, Aug 13: The rupee lost 60 to a US dollar in the open 
market on Thursday. The dollar closed at Rs 57.70 for buying and Rs 
57.80 for selling against Rs 57.10 and Rs 57.20 on Wednesday.
    
Money changers said the rupee fell because the supply of the 
greenback slowed with no change in the its demand. They said the 
supply was affected by a fresh wave of violence on Wednesday 
bringing business activities to a halt in parts of the city on 
Thursday.
    
"The rupee fell as there was little supply of dollar against a 
usual high demand," said Ovais Kalia of KKI money brokerage.
    
In the inter-bank market the rupee remained firm. Bankers said 
floating inter-bank rates of the dollar closed at almost at the 
level seen on Wednesday i.e. Rs 53.00 for buying and Rs 53.50 for 
selling.
    
They said the rates had gone up to Rs 53.40 and Rs 53.80 in early 
trading when the State Bank invited quotations from the banks. They 
said the rates fell back to the previous level as SBP refrained 
from buying dollars from the market.
    
SBP closing composite rates  based on buying and selling rates of 
16 selected banks  remained almost unchanged at Rs 49.78 for 
buying and Rs 49.17 for selling.

<a name="unpa">Unpaid bills of WAPDA, KESC swell to Rs53.8bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: Total outstanding bills of WAPDA and KESC 
against the federal and provincial governments and domestic and 
private consumers have gone up to Rs 53.8 billion, an increase of 
97 per cent over the last one year, Dawn reliably learnt.
    
The total outstanding bills of WAPDA and KESC on July 1, 1997 were 
at Rs 21 billion, which jumped to Rs 53.8 billion as the Muslim 
League government rescinded the deduction at source policy, in case 
of the provinces and federal government departments.
    
Since the policy has been reversed the outstanding bills against 
the provinces and federal government shot up as they did not pay a 
penny over the last one year, said a source at the ministry of 
water and power.
    
In view of the sharp increase in the recoverables of WAPDA,the 
government had decided to revoke the "deduction at source", in case 
of the provincial governments and the federal government 
departments.
    
The finance ministry used to deduct the outstanding amount of the 
utility bills from the periodic releases to the provinces from the 
federal divisible polls which was called "deduction at source".
    
The total outstanding bills of WAPDA against the provincial 
governments alone were of Rs 13 billion and if the amount payable 
against federal government was included in it then the figure 
increased to Rs 18.6 billion.
    
In some cases the finance ministry has already started deduction at 
source but provincial governments particularly Sindh government was 
strongly opposing it.
    
The provincial governments had not been accepting the amount 
charged to them on account of electricity bills. Therefore the 
government set up reconciliatory committees which sorted out the 
dispute and except for Sindh government all the other three 
government agreed on what ever charged from them.
    
The Sindh government, which has to pay Rs 8 billion on account of 
electricity bill has refused to accept the amount and was not ready 
to get their bills deducted from their share in federal divisible 
poll.
    
Federal government and its departments had to pay an amount of Rs 
5.6 billion, Punjab government owed an amount of Rs 3 billion to 
WAPDA, NWFP Rs 1.2 billion, Balochistan Rs 0.3 billion, agriculture 
tubewells in Balochistan Rs 3.4 billion and FATA Rs 2 billion.
    
An amount of Rs 14 billion was outstanding against the commercial 
and domestic consumers. "The rate of recovery in case of domestic 
consumers is 97 per cent, which seems that only domestic consumers 
are paying their bills regularly, said the source.

decumulate Pakistani imports of unbleached cotton fabrics (UBF) 
from those of other countries, the exporters have urged the 
government to immediately refer the issue of anti-dumping to WTO.
    
The Commission recently imposed definitive duties on imports of 
unbleached cotton fabrics from Pakistan and four other Asian 
countries but dropped out Turkey on grounds of finding no 
sufficient proof of injury to European textile industry on imports 
of UCF from that country.
    
The Pakistani exporters and manufacturers of UCF to European market 
took up the issue with EC seeking similar status for imports from 
Pakistan. They argued that a comparison between the situation of 
Turkey and Pakistan depicted that the reasons set out in favour of 
the decumulation of Turkey equally applied to Pakistan.
    
While putting forward their case with EC the Pakistani exporters 
pointed out the imports from Pakistan to European market between 
1996 and the investigation period decreased from 24,517 tons to 
14,462 tons showing a drop of 41 per cent. They feel that the 
Commission has decumulated Turkey on similar grounds.
    
Despite all the evidences and arguments extended by Pakistani 
exporters of UCF to the European market the Commission rejected 
their plea. However, the EC lowered the country average from 10.5 
per cent to 9.5 per cent of the punitive duties to correct the 
earlier mistake while calculating the dumping margins.
    
The Pakistani exporters who were initially willing to give price 
undertaking to EC on withdrawing definitive duties on imports of 
UCF have to backout fearing that the Commission may take this as an 
acceptance of dumping by them.
    
In the meantime India who had also been subjected to dumping 
margins on imports of UCF by the Commission took a hard line and 
referred the case to WTO. It has officially requested consultations 
with the Commission at WTO level in Geneva to take place on Sept 17 
to 18.
    
If the matter is not resolved at the consultation level, India 
within 60 days will have to put it before Dispute Settlement Board 
(DSB) of WTO. India has taken up both the case of bedlinen as well 
as of UCF with the WTO.
    
APTMA convener on anti-dumping committee and WTO affairs, Akber 
Sheikh told Dawn that we would like our government, without loss of 
time, to take up the matter with WTO.
    
"All along APTMA had been fighting this legal battle with the EC 
but now the time has come where the government will have to act and 
"act fast" because APTMA in its individual capacity could not 
approach WTO," he added.
    
He was highly critical of EC which had taken up this matter purely 
on political consideration and added that Turkey being Customs 
member of the European Union had been exempted from duty margins. 
Similarly, he said that on the request of Austria the Commission 
has exempted from punitive duties the fabrics used for embroidery.

<a name="mult">Multiple factors deter KSE from extending rally</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Aug 13: Stocks on Thursday failed to extend the previous 
rally as a combination of negative news including killings in the 
city in a fresh wave of violence triggered selling from the jobbers 
and weakholders but larger decline was resisted, thanks to the 
presence of support at the dips.
    
The opening was a bit higher, what the dealers called, an extension 
of the overnight run-up and a good bit of fresh covering purchases 
in the pivotals but late selling caused by city violence and 
Friday's closure on account of independence again pushed the market 
into the minus column.
    
The KSE 100-share index fell 12.14 points at 964.83 as compared to 
976.97 a day earlier, reflecting the weakness of some leading base 
shares.
    
The market capitalization suffered a decline of Rs3 billion at 
Rs280.896 billion as compared to Rs283.903 billion a day earlier, 
owing largely to heavy selling in Hub-Power.
    
Floor brokers said the index should have suffered a much bigger 
decline but heavy buying in PTCL did not allow larger fall as it 
holds a weightage of 33 per cent in it owing to its massive capital 
outlay.
    
"What seems to have halted the market's upward trend is news 
originating from Washington that there might be no bail-out plan 
from any donor until Pakistan signs CTBT", dealers said.
    
Press reports indicated that the current initiative of the Islamic 
Development Bank (IDB) to line-up Gulf money to bail-out Pakistan 
from the current financial crisis might stay deferred for an 
indefinite period apparently awaiting the American nod.
    
Another bearish news came from the reports that major oil companies 
have threatened to withdraw their investment from Pakistan.
    
"Pakistan might not be progressively inching towards a default on 
debt payments, the financial situation is not ideal either", some 
analysts said.
    
However, larger decline was resisted thanks to the presence of 
strong support in the pivotal on technical grounds with PTCL being 
in the lead. It came in for renewed massive buying both from the 
local and as well as from the foreign investors and managed to 
finish with a modest rise of 10 paisa after at one stage trading 
went as high as Rs22.90 on strong early speculative buying.
    
Hub-Power, however, received heavy battering at the higher levels 
and fell sharply by Rs1.25, as it failed to attract buyers at the 
lower levels. Among other MNCs, Engro Chemical came in for renewed 
selling despite an interim dividend of 25 per cent on post-tax half 
year profit of Rs486.277 million. But Fauji Fertiliser, another 
fertilizer gain reacted favourably to the news of aftertax profit 
of Rs1.675 billion.
    
Major losers were led by Pak-Suzuki Motors, Engro Chemical, Glaxo-
Wellcome, Shell Pakistan and Lever Brothers falling by Rs2.00 to 
20.00. Prominent gainers were Fauji Fertiliser and Packages which 
rose by 95 paisa and Rs4.50.
    
Among the local leading issues which came in for active selling, 
EFU General Insurance, Highnoon Lab, Kohat Cement and Bankers 
Equity were leading the fall from Re1 to Rs2.50. Trading volume 
rose to 131 million shares from the previous 121 million shares, 

while losers led gainers by a fair margin at 64 to 23, with 35 
holding on to the last levels, out of 122 actives.
    
PTCL again came in for massive buying and finished higher by 10 
paisa at Rs22.10 on 88 million shares; followed by Hub-Power off 
Rs1.25 at 13.75 on 35 million shares; ICI Pakistan lower 25 paisa 
at Rs1.2.45 on 3.415 million shares; Fauji Fertiliser up 95 paisa 
at Rs52.15 on 0.864 million shares and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser 
unchanged at Rs13.55 on 0.531 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by PSO off Rs2.60 on 0439 
million shares; followed by Engro Chemical lower Rs2.85 on 0.392 
million shares; Sui Southern easy 15 paisa on 0342 million shares; 
Unity Modaraba unchanged on 0.201 million shares; Faysal Bank off 
60 paisa on 0.195 million shares; Sui Northern lower 25 paisa on 
0.184 million shares; and Japan Power lower 15 paisa on 0.165 
million shares.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

AND now Leghari, in the run-up to the launch of his Millat party in 
Lahore on August 14, says to us that there should be 
accountability. Unbelievable, after the chance he had in November 
1996 as caretaker president, when the judiciary, the army and his 
fellow caretakers were all willing to prop him up if he postponed 
the elections and, in line with the people's wishes, initiated 
Ehtesab rather than Intekhab.
    
But, no, he made a deal with Nawaz Sharif, and had to protect him. 
Besides, he was far too frightened as to what an accountability 
process might throw up about his own past doings. This country 
cannot afford Farooq Leghari. He failed in one test, and like the 
other second-timers will fail again.
    
Political beneficiary, culpable Nawaz Sharif, when he came in for 
his first term in 1990, similarly had no interest in 
accountability, in actually serving the much bandied 'national 
interest' by bringing to book Benazir Bhutto and her cronies. 
Rather, he took off on his binge, misusing his office, using his 
political clout to borrow beyond his means from the cooperative 
societies (which he and his Chaudhry pals successfully finished 
off), from the DFIs and the CFIs. At borrowing time, the entire 
vast Mian family grouped together borrowed unscrupulously. He ran 
his businesses on unsecured loans and by issuing at will 'Statutory 
Regulatory Orders', revenue SROs, to suit his schemes..
    
Here he is with us now, for his second round, once again using his 
political clout, amending the Constitution and legislating merely 
to suit and protect himself and his own interests. This time, he is 
supposedly rescheduling his loan repayments. But he is repaying 
nothing and has conveniently disowned responsibility for many in 
his defaulting family. He claims that he could have paid back had 
his industries been allowed to function (as they functioned during 
his rule with supporting SROs) during Benazir Bhutto's second 
round. According to the State Bank, his group owes Rs.5 billion 
(Rs.500 crores) to the exchequer which, though he can pay back, he 
maintains he cannot. At the same time, he wishes us to accept that 
he is not the country's Number One defaulter. His recent manoeuvre, 
Ittefaq's repayment agreement, drafted by the defaulters themselves 
which he had approved by the eight creditor banks, is but a 
charade. The banks were ordered to sign, and he has been sanctified 
in his own court of law. 
   
Did he not foresee that other defaulters would claim the same 
privilege? For instance, Abid and Asif Saigol, sponsors of the 
Mohib Textile Mills, have claimed in an advertisement published in 
The Nation on July 12, that their "company has been incorrectly 
placed on the list of wilful defaulters," and that they "have 
voluntarily submitted themselves to the Lahore High Court ..... and 
are fully committed to adjust their liabilities from sale of 
assets, along the lines of the example set by the prime minister 
and his family." They will also, hopefully, find friendly 
sanctifiers and adjustors of their default. Other grand defaulters 
will emulate the fine example set, and we will be left high and 
dry.
 
Whilst all this has been happening, Benazir Bhutto, husband Asif 
Zardari, and their mixed bag of cronies have been hooked. This is 
one of the very few achievements of this government. All that 
remains is for the line to be drawn in. If this is not done before 
the present lot fall, they will never be forgiven for not 
completing the job. Saifur Rahman has worked hard. He has traced 
the alleged stolen money, traced the alleged theft to its source, 
and driven Benazir Bhutto to the point of contradicting herself. 
She accuses the Swiss and British judicial systems of being as 
inept and corrupt as is ours, and gullible to boot. The foreign 
media is being of great help  particularly the BBC in interviews 
that we see here. She is in the big league, with the Shah of Shahs, 
the Marcoses and Mobutus, the Bokassas, the Suhartos, who even 
though out in the cold, or dead, with all proven against them, 
never admitted that they robbed their countries.
    
On to the lesser beings. PML secretary-general Sartaj Aziz was 
finance minister in both Nawaz governments, in this one up to two 
days ago. Before exiting and handing over his portfolio, having 
already told us that we are in a mess and that difficult times lie 
ahead, he wrote his swan song, 'Why foreign currency accounts were 
frozen' (printed in this newspaper on August 5). He has attempted 
to justify the gross wrongs to which he was a party. He would have 
done better to go silently.
    
The foreign currency account facility was there in 1991. So, he 
should have understood two fundamental requirements. First, a 
government's contractual obligation is sacrosanct. Its word must be 
its bond. Second, if a government keeps breaking its own contracts, 
what credibility can it retain, what trust can the people have in 
it? Sartaj Aziz was finance minister in 1991 and remained in that 
position until 1993. What did he do to ensure that the government 
would not renege on its obligation? In fact, he was party to a 
massive squandering of public money both then and now, e.g., a 
billion dollar each on yellow cabs and motorway. He left the 
treasury bankrupt in 1993, and again, now. When the first Nawaz 
Sharif government finally fell in July of that year, reserves were 
down to 100 million dollars. This time we are in default. Apart 
from large debts in local currency, we owe $ 42 billion to foreign 
institutions. By his own account his government squandered two 
billion dollars of the increase in foreign currency deposits in 
less than 18 months, in addition to a similar amount of incremental 
short-term borrowing.
   
Sartaj Aziz claimed a shortfall in exports when the world economy 
was booming. Should this not be put down to poor policies and 
mismanagement? During both governments he allowed the effective 
exchange rate to appreciate, penalizing exporters. As economic 
czar, what did he do to clean up the financial system and privatize 
the banks? The only bank privatized during the first round was the 
Muslim Commercial Bank which went to a crony. This time around a 
defaulter has been made chairman of the Privatization Commission 
and not one large financial organization has been privatized. Loan 
recovery remains paralyzed. Defaulting leaders cannot force their 
defaulting flock, or any others, to pay up. Budget management has 
been abominable. Each time, the deficit has increased and none of 
the agreements reached with the IMF was ever completed.
    
The fact that a major part of the deposits belonged to residents 
does not give the government the licence to confiscate them. Many 
middle class people had to take refuge in dollars because the 
government's inflationary policies were continually eroding the 
value of their rupee savings.
    
Hafiz Pasha is a likeable young man who tends to the needs of two 
wives and manages two households. He has taken on a job which 
primarily requires of him to change the mindset of Mian Mohammad 
Nawaz Sharif. Does he think he can do that? As the PM&FM's adviser, 
he is de facto finance minister. Should he not open up and tell us 
what the 'basket' he has taken on contains so that we may better 
understand his impending swan song?
    
The present ruling lot have no creditibility. Lenders will only 
come for a credible government capable of fulfilling its promises. 
Should any lenders now come,for their own good reasons, they will 
squeeze us dry. Potential lenders have already seen how incapable 
Nawaz Sharif is of even having the economy documented. His 
constituents go on strike for just not having their names entered 
on the taxman's lists and what does Nawaz Sharif do? He gives in.
 
If we are to survive, the next man in must, repeat must, be a good 
clean man who has never sat as a member in any of our 'august' 
assemblies or in the even more 'august' Senate. He will have to do 
as the Ukranians have just done. To quote from an AFP report of 
August 5, "Kiev: The Ukranian authorities locked 500 local and 
regional leaders, as well as 1,700 business leaders, in a 
conference centre and told them that they would stay there until 
they start paying off their tax debts. The government has laid on 
food, water and telephones for its 'prisoners.' They had been 
invited by the government to discuss Ukraine's financial problems."
    
Our Parliament House is large enough to contain all our loan 
defaulters, tax evaders and plain robbers. For good measure, Rafiq 
Tarar can also be invited to the party.

Irfan Husain

INDEPENDENCE DAY gives hacks and editorial writers yet another 
opportunity to do some more soul-searching and breast-beating about 
the dismal state of the nation.
    
Rest assured that I won't let this opportunity slip by without 
recording my personal angst. To my mind, the wonder of the age is 
electronic mail: suddenly, we are all connected through an 
inexpensive and quick medium. I had not grasped the extent of this 
network until my e-mail address started appearing with my column in 
the splendid Internet edition of this newspaper. I now find myself 
flooded with mail from overseas readers who have overwhelmed me 
with their passionate concerns and criticism of what is happening 
in Pakistan and to Pakistanis. I try and respond to as many as 
possible, and apologize to those whose letters I have not yet 
answered.
    
The burden of the refrain from readers abroad is how callously and 
shamelessly our leaders, present and past, have ripped off this 
unfortunate nation. Although there is almost universal condemnation 
of the policies being followed by Nawaz Sharif, his rival Benazir 
Bhutto has almost no supporters either. Basically, the message I am 
getting is "a plague on both their houses." The freezing of foreign 
exchange accounts has come in for particularly heavy electronic 
flak.
    
Many of the letters are from Indian readers; indeed, I was 
pleasantly surprised to learn how many Indians read the Internet 
edition of Dawn. Many of them have said they were impressed and 
amazed that I was allowed to express the kind of views that I do. 
Disconcertingly, several expatriate Pakistanis have communicated 
their concern for my safety! But one recent letter in particular 
started me thinking. Basically, the writer said that given the 
multitude and magnitude of the self-created problems Pakistan 
faces, it seemed fair to ask whether Partition was in fact 
justified.
    
Fifty-one years after Pakistan came into being, I think we are 
mature enough to take stock of where we are, and prepare a balance 
sheet of the positive and negative aspects of independent 
statehood. It is a fact that the areas constituting Pakistan today 
were the most backward provinces of undivided India, and seen in 
this context, the development of the physical infrastructure has 
been impressive. Electricity, roads and telephones now reach the 
remotest parts of the land, and thousands of factories have been 
erected where none existed before.

Our signal failing has been in the social sector. Malign neglect by 
successive governments has ensured that Pakistan is near the bottom 
of world rankings for health and education. An illiterate and 
disease-prone workforce has kept productivity low, and this has had 
a direct bearing on our inability to compete effectively in the 
global market.
    
But our biggest failing lies in the crisis of leadership: short-
sighted, selfish leaders and power-hungry demagogues have ensured 
that our most fundamental problems stay unresolved. Issues like the 
national language, the degree of provincial autonomy and local 
government still keep getting raised after half a century of 
independent existence. We have been unable to arrive at a consensus 
on the most basic issues. It would appear that we have created a 
state without creating a nation.
    
This failure to forge a national identity or a shared vision has 
resulted in the groping for direction that is so evident in every 
aspect of our public life. Indeed, the fifty years that have passed 
since Mr Jinnah's death have witnessed the bitter struggle between 
the rational, secular outlook advocated by the founder of the 
nation, and the obscurantist, backward vision so militantly pushed 
by his erstwhile enemies. It would appear that the latter view has 
triumphed, but given what this conflict has cost us, it has been a 
pyrrhic victory.
    
All these conflicting ideas and ideals have served to distract the 
country's leadership from the main task of governing. At the best 
of times, Pakistan is a fractious, deeply divided country that is 
very difficult to rule, but when the rulers are forever bickering 
over obscure issues, governance becomes that much more difficult to 
provide.
    
Another problem inherent in newly created states like Pakistan is 
that psychologically, people aren't sure how long such countries 
will last, so they develop a grab-it-while-you-can mentality. This 
is evident in the greedy, grabby approach our ruling elites have 
adopted whether they are in politics, business or administration. 
Carpetbaggers enter politics to make money and protect their narrow 
interests, and not from any altruistic motive. Given these base 
impulses, it should surprise nobody when these shady characters go 
berserk when they achieve power.
    
One problem directly connected to our independence is the huge 
expense we incur on defence, and the corresponding neglect the 
social sector has suffered. India's implacable hostility since the 
Kashmir conflict has fuelled our deep-seated insecurity and made us 
spend far more on our armed services than we could afford. The 
result of this confrontation is before us in the shambles our 
economy is in today. Of course, mismanagement has played a major 
role in producing this scenario, but had it not been for our 
perceived need to maintain our defences at current levels, we could 
have saved literally thousands of billions of rupees over the 
years.
    
Our mutual animosity saw its ultimate expression in the recent 
nuclear tests both countries carried out. Both are paying a high 
price, but sanctions are hurting us far more because of the 
fragility of our economy. Fifty years after independence, we are 
wondering how we are going to avoid default.
    
The breakdown in the authority of the state is another byproduct of 
the confusion and conflict that fester in the republic. Law and 
order have broken down completely, and sectarian and ethnic gangs 
carry out their crackpot agendas at will, killing and maiming their 
rivals as well as the innocent without fear of punishment. 
Demoralized and untrained policemen are no match for the well-armed 
and motivated thugs who control the streets.
    
So who has gained most from Partition? The feudals, certainly. They 
have managed to keep their extended holdings, mostly awarded by the 
British for good behaviour, whereas their Indian counterparts lost 
their estates through a succession of land reforms. Many business 
families have thrived for lack of competition, and fortunes have 
been made by lodging false property claims after the exchange of 
populations in 1947. But the average Pakistani remains poor, 
illiterate and without the basic amenities. For him, like his 
Indian cousin, Partition has brought little relief.
    
How then to answer my reader who triggered this chain of thought 
through his letter? The best I can do is to suggest that we look at 
the question through the prism of our own experience. But whatever 
our perspective, I don't think there can be any doubt that to 
varying degrees, both India and Pakistan were wounded at birth in 
1947.

<a name="shou">Should Pakistan sign the CTBT?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Akhtar Ali

HAVING congratulated ourselves enough for the nuclear explosions of 
May, it is time to realistically evaluate and appreciate our 
prospects and predicament. Firstly, there is a notion that Pakistan 
has become a nuclear power, while it has at best become a nuclear 
weapon state and that too at a very initiate stage.
    
Pakistan certainly lacks the collateral for being awarded the 
dubious distinction of a nuclear power. There are scores of 
countries in the world which, if they decide to acquire nuclear 
weapons, would be able to do so in a matter of few years. Most of 
the European countries, Japan, a number of South-East Asian and 
Latin American countries are in this category.
    
Quite a few among these consider nuclear weapons to be endangering 
security rather than bolstering it, and thus have renounced their 
nuclear ambition. Hence a more balanced evaluation of our having 
acquired some prestige and nuisance value would be in order. For a 
country that has been losing vitality and going down on most 
counts, nuclear testing could be morale boosting. However, it 
should not lead to a jingoism of the kind some extremist political 
parties have been displaying on the streets lately.
    
We are passing through great and critical times when momentous 
decisions have to be taken. In May, the crucial decision and action 
of nuclear explosions was taken. Now in a rather short spell of 
time, we have to decide whether we take on the world powers and 
incur their wrath or sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) 
as a minimum to assuage the concerns of the big powers.
    
Here we will examine the CTBT briefly and the pros and cons of 
Pakistan signing or abstaining from it. We will also examine 
Pakistan�s strategic and nuclear options, the case of installing a 
confidence-building regime and finally recommend a strategy for 
Pakistan.
    
One nuclear imperative is a continued need for testing and it is 
never enough. Fortunately, this is not the mainstream view. At the 
other end is Israel which has not deemed it essential to resort to 
nuclear tests, possibly because data on validated designs was 
available to it. With continued advancement of mathematical 
modelling, testing and experimentation even for design validation 
and others would go increasingly out of fashion. One hopes that 
ultimately Pakistan would have the necessary hardware and software 
to conduct such modelling if and when required, obviating the need 
for frequent nuclear testing.
    
Continued nuclear testing is not required to build and maintain a 
credible nuclear deterrent for Pakistan vis-a-vis India. In fact, 
six explosions are more than enough. A nuclear force with 20-50 
warheads is well within the reach of a technological system that 
can make six explosions in a series. For the next 7-10 years such a 
nuclear deterrent, whether overt or covert, is going to work. 
Further testing would only earn political enmity and condemnation 
worldwide and bring in little technological advancement of 
practical value. Shunning the testing option which is what CTBT is 
about does not seriously compromise Pakistan�s security in a 
significant way. The suggestion of a unilateral accession to CTBT 
by Ms Benazir Bhutto should not be taken lightly. It borrows 
Pakistan a breathing time, away from back-breaking economic 
sanctions which may ultimately break national cohesion and social 
stability.
    
In September 1998, a conference would be called to review the 
accession status and decide the future course of action with 
respect to non-accession. In that sense, technically all signatures 
made before that date are conditional, tied to accession by all 
other parties. In practice, however, it is highly likely that the 
treaty would go into force �provisionally� on the appointed date 
with a few states being out of it. The treaty involves a two-stage 
accession process: signature by the executive and ratification by 
the state. There is a provision for withdrawal if extraordinary 
circumstances compel a state to do so. The withdrawing state would 
be required to state precise reasons which may have dictated its 
withdrawal.
    
The treaty, however, is for perpetuity, unlike NPT (nuclear non-
proliferation treaty) which was initially negotiated for twenty 
years and was extended into perpetuity through a review conference 
in 1990.
    
A comprehensive test ban organization has been already put in 
place. It would install and operate a global monitoring system 
based on four different technologies, virtually obviating a chance 
of missing a significant explosion and would be able to 
sufficiently discriminate between earthquake and nuclear explosion.
    
There is some misunderstanding in the media and among general 
public that CTBT would freeze all our nuclear activities and that 
all of the nuclear facilities, including ones at Kahuta, would have 
to be open for international inspection. Nothing is further from 
the truth. The following features of the treaty should be noted:
    
a) CTBT forbids only nuclear explosions and testing; all other 
nuclear research and activities, including nuclear power, fissile 
material production and even making of nuclear weapons, are outside 
the purview of the treaty and are by definition permissible.
    
b) The monitoring and verification (M&V) under the treaty is for 
area monitoring detecting nuclear explosions. No inspection of 
nuclear facilities is involved. Testing/explosion sites may be 
physically inspected on the basis of remote monitoring evidence. 
The remote sensing technologies are specified. Essentially, in all 
those technologies wide sensors would be installed which would be 
linked to regional and global monitoring devices and computers. Any 
earth movement or shock of more than a kilo ton would be 
detectable. Actual drilling at the suspected site may be done under 
the treaty, to detect nuclear tests or explosion, should monitoring 
system throw some doubtful evidence or suspicion on a state�s 
activity.
    
c) There is safeguard against frivolous and intrusive verification 
activities. There is provision for respect of confidentiality 
regarding activities and processes which fall beyond the purview of 
the treaty which is nuclear explosion/testing specific.
    
One may wonder then as to why such a big fuss is being made over 
CTBT by the US and others. In fact, many opponents of this treaty 
have termed it very mild and even useless. It had been negotiated 
over the past two decades or more for preventing the modernization 
and development of even more dangerous nuclear weapons. The key 
word is �development.� It does not forbid making of nuclear weapons 
of any size, design, etc. It had been primarily negotiated to 
control quantitative arms race among the nuclear weapons countries.
    
Recently the merit of the treaty for threshold nuclear weapon 
states and small nuclear powers such as India, Pakistan, Israel, 
North Korea, and possibly other future nuclear contenders, has been 
discovered. Nuclear testing or explosion is a characteristic 
milestone in nuclear weapon development activities, separating a 
covert developmental stage from an overt and active one. Thus it 
puts a bar on the new entrants into the list of declared nuclear 
weapon countries, which stand to be seven or eight if one includes 
Israel. To press my point further, I would add that despite a 
global CTBT regime, it is quite possible that another 10 countries 
may develop and pursue a covert nuclear weapons programme. The 
treaty would not be stand in the way of such countries.

Thus it can be safely concluded that if Pakistan signs CTBT, it 
would have to forgo only nuclear testing/explosion. All its other 
nuclear activities could continue, including making of nuclear 
weapons or missile and their deployment. Apart from putting a break 
on nuclear weapons modernization and upgradation, CTBT is meant to 
be as the first global instrument as a minimum to engage the world 
on reduction and possibly elimination of nuclear weapons.
    
Its significance is primarily moral and political. The objective is 
to unify the world system on a platform on a minimum platform of 
nuclear restraint. The idealists had hoped earlier that India which 
opposed NPT on the grounds of its being discriminatory would join 
CTBT, especially because up to early nineties, was at the forefront 
of CTBT. The treaty is offering a face-saving device to P-5 and G-8 
countries, who consider the nuclear explosions in South Asia a 
clear defiance of international public opinion and a blow to their 
nuclear reduction policies.
 
Keeping in view Pakistan�s precarious economic situation, CTBT is 
not such a big price to pay. Pakistan could make a beginning by 
signing the treaty. Israel has signed it and announced that its 
ratification would be dependent on the policies and actions of its 
neighbours vis-a-vis CTBT. The issue of ratification can be handled 
over the next one year. The choice of unilateral accession or 
insistence on Indian accession could be a subject of negotiation. 
With every passing day, the reward for signing CTBT may be coming 
down. In a possible uncontrollable socio-economic turmoil, 
immediate ratification of CTBT may be demanded without awarding any 
significant concessions. It is in our national interest to sign 
CTBT as soon as possible.

<a name="hani">Hanif declines to inspect Sahara Cup wickets</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 11: Former captain Hanif Mohammad has turned down the 
proposal of visiting Toronto, Canada, to inspect and submit a 
report on the wickets on which the forthcoming Sahara Cup between 
Pakistan and India would be played.
    
Hanif, who is widely acknowledged as the best judge of wickets, was 
approached by a selector on behalf of the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB). The selection committee wanted to inquire about the strips 
before finalizing the 14-man squad.
    
"There have been different wickets in the last two editions of the 
(best-of-five) series. In the 1996 event (won 3-2 by Pakistan), the 
wickets were more conducive for the spinners while last year (won 
by India 4-1), they favoured more to the seamers. We don't know how 
they would behave this time and that's why we requested PCB to fly 
someone to Canada to give a first-hand information," sources 
stated.
    
However, Hanif rejected the idea saying that the proposal was not a 
practical one. "There is still one month left before the event 

begins. Naturally, the weather will change owing to which the 
surface will also change. Then I also don't know the quality of the 
equipment which the organisers have to protect the wickets. 
Besides, the soil and the roller used on the wickets are unknown.
    
`It would be too big a risk to predict about the strips at this 
stage," Hanif said on Tuesday.

<a name="pcbi">PCB in the throes of finding a captain</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Aug 12: The top officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB) are desperately trying to reach a consensus on the captaincy 
issue but all their efforts have gone in vain.
    
According to reliable sources, the chairman of the PCB, and 
majority of the councillors, are supporting Aamir Sohail but they 
are strongly opposed by chief executive.
    
Sources said preliminary discussions on the captain were held in 
order to avert the crisis in Sunday's executive council meeting 
which at this stage looks inevitable.
    
Informed sources claimed that Majid Khan has categorically rejected 
Aamir Sohail's name and in fact has put his weight behind Mohammad 
Wasim and Rashid Latif.
    
However, the two names have been rejected by some of the 
councillors who suggest that either Salim Malik or Wasim Akram be 
installed as captain.
    
But because of the match-fixing and betting tag attached with their 
names, they too have been set aside.
    
Sohail was the vice-captain on the recent tour of Africa and led 
Pakistan to victory at Durban when Rashid Latif was injured. In 
1996, he skippered Pakistan to victory over Sri Lanka in the 
triangular series in Singapore but lost immediately in Sharjah.
    
Majid's opposition to Aamir Sohail is quite understandable as the 
latter misbehaved with the chief executive earlier last year. After 
a disciplinary hearing, Sohail was banned for one months.
    
But things changed when Mahmood took over. He lobbied for Sohail 
and succeeded in making him the vice-captain though he was 
initially favoured to win the captain's job.
    
While there appears strong support in the council for Sohail, 
another interesting idea has been floated by a couple of 
councillors who want Javed Miandad to be appointed player, captain 
and coach. It is to be seen if the suggestion would impress the 
other members of the council as Miandad retired after the 1996 
World Cup and since then has played just one game for KCCA in the 
National One-day Championship semi-final against Allied Bank.
    
Miandad's last first-class game was against Zimbabwe in the 1993-94 
season.
 
While there is difference of opinions on captain, consensus has 
reached on coach as sources said Javed Miandad is being unanimously 
supported by Khalid Mahmood and Majid Khan.
    
According to sources, the PCB has agreed to Miandad's terms and 
conditions.
    
"Money is irrelevant if we get the best man who at the moment 
appears to be Javed Miandad," sources close to Khalid Mahmood said.

As far as Mohsin Hasan Khan is concerned, he is expected to be made 
incharge of Pakistan A and Under-19 teams. Pakistan A is scheduled 
to participate in the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, World Super 
Eight competition in Australia (in October) besides touring New 
Zealand (in November) and hosting England A in February-March next 
year. The Under-19 assignments include home series against South 
Africa Under-19 in January next year.
