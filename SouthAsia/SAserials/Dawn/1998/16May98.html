-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, May 14: The federal cabinet held a special session here 
on Thursday on the implications of India's nuclear tests and 
decided to first gauge the international reaction against New Delhi 
before responding to any similar experiment.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif set up 
a four-member committee to look into all aspects for dealing with 
the issue.
    
The committee will be headed by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub. Other 
members will be Kashmir Affairs Minister Lt-Gen (retd) Majeed 
Malik, Information Minister Mushahid Hussain Syed and Religious 
Affairs Minister Raja Zafarul Haq.
    
Immediately after the meeting, the committee began deliberations 
with the foreign ministry. The cabinet also discussed the 
possibility of convening a special session of both houses of the 
parliament.
    
Sources said all ministers made emotional speeches and most of them 
favoured a nuclear test. They said Pakistan should not trust its so 
called western allies any longer and manufacture nuclear devices.
    
The prime minister told the cabinet that tough international 
sanctions were expected to be slapped on India for having conducted 

five nuclear tests. In case, he pointed out, the international 
community failed to fulfil its obligations for imposing what he 
termed "severest" sanctions against India, Pakistan might exercise 
its right to conduct nuclear tests for ensuring security.
    
In this regard, sources said the cabinet also decided to keenly 
observe the proceedings and outcome of the meeting of the countries 
of G-8 at Birmingham (Britain) on Friday (May 15). "Japan has 
called for taking up the issue of India's nuclear tests at the 
Birmingham meeting", said a diplomat.
    
But he said it was doubtful that Britain would allow a discussion 
over the issue.
    
Sources said the prime minister informed the cabinet about 
Wednesday's deliberations of the defence committee of the cabinet 
and assured them that national interests would be kept supreme 
before taking any final decision.
    
He said Pakistan's enemies were well aware of the capabilities of 
the country's scientists to conduct any nuclear test in the 
shortest possible time.
    
The cabinet reviewed the serious threat to peace and security in 
the region arising as a consequence of India's nuclear tests.

<a name="alla">All aspects of N-test evaluated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, May 13: The Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) on 
Wednesday evaluated threadbare all the aspects that may warrant 
Pakistan to go for a nuclear test in the light of Indian nuclear 
tests on Monday.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired the meeting which was also 
attended by the chiefs of armed forces and Dr Qadeer Khan, chief of 
the Kahuta Reseach Laboratories.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that divergent views were expressed by 
the participants whether or not to exercise the option of nuclear 
test.
    
Sources said that defence authorities and Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Gohar Ayub believed that Pakistan should reciprocate by 
conducting a nuclear test of its own. But Minister for Finance 
Senator Sartaj Aziz backed by couple of other members of the DCC 
warned that in case Pakistan went for the extreme option, there 
could be very harsh international reaction which in their opinion 
may eventually deprive Pakistan of all foreign assistance.
    
Sources said that head of the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL) Dr 
Qadeer Khan who for the first time attended the DCC meeting 
apprised the participants about the "latest position" of the 
country's peaceful nuclear programme. Nevertheless, he said he and 
his colleagues were capable of meeting the challenge and conduct a 
nuclear test as and when desired.
    
"The doctor says it is a question of hours and not days to get 
everything arranged to conduct a more comprehensive nuclear test 
than those of India which were tested during the last two days", 
said a source.
    
The sources said Dr Qadeer told the DCC that he did not need any 
additional equipment to come up to the expectation of the 
government and the country to conduct a successful nuclear test.
    
However, the meeting decided to exercise restraints despite open 
provocations by India. It said that Pakistan was a peaceful country 
and wanted to remain peaceful. But it warned of serious 
consequences if the international community specially the USA did 
not play its due role in this behalf by getting all the necessary 
sanctions imposed against India.
    
Sources said that Dr Qadeer would soon be briefing the civil and 
military leadership about the latest situation by taking them to 
"country's different nuclear installations".
    
"When they dispersed they were in a highly upbeat mood, with Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif saying that our people have all the 
capabilities to give a fitting reply to India," said a source.
    
A press release was issued by the government at the end of the 
meeting which said that after comprehensively evaluating the 
defence preparedness, the DCC meeting expressed satisfaction over 
Pakistan's ability to respond effectively and adequately to the new 
threats and challenges. The DCC was convened to take stock of the 
situation arising from nuclear tests and nuclear weaponisation by 
India.

<a name="blas">Blasphemy law: Christians, SSP & others hold demos</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, May 15: Tension gripped many areas in Rawalpindi when 
Muslims and Christians on Friday staged separate demonstrations 
simultaneously on the issue of blasphemy law, causing injuries to 
several people and damage to government and private property.
    
Heavy contingents of the police resorted to teargas shelling and 
baton-charge to disperse the protesters, and arrested some 60 
Christians for damaging property and violating section 144, under 
which all types of demonstrations and rallies had been banned on 
Murree Road by the district administration.
    
Activists of the Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and the Jamiat Ahle 
Sunnat Waljamaat also staged a peaceful demonstration at Fowara 
Chowk and warned the government of dire consequences if it made any 
amendment to the blasphemy law.
    
The Christians staged demonstrations at many places in the city, 
including Lalkurti, Ariya Mohalla, Tariqabad, Iqbal Road, Committee 
Chowk and DAV College Road and demanded the repeal of the blasphemy 
law.
    
When the leaders of Christian community started their speeches, 
some young Christian men came on the stage and said they had 
gathered there for the protest not to hear the speeches dictated by 
the district administration.
    
The organizers of the function asked those young Christians to 
lodge their protest peacefully. However, the young people refused 
to obey the orders of their elders and went on protest at Murree 
Road.
    
The demonstrators, led by Sohail Ishtiaq and Dr David, were 
carrying sticks, placards and banners inscribed with different 
slogans. They were also raising slogans against the government and 
termed the blasphemy law "black and blind law."
    
Earlier, the police present at Murree Road asked the protesters to 
disperse peacefully and not to create any untoward incident. In the 
meantime, the demonstrators pelted stones on the police party and 
private cars, causing damage to several shops and private vehicles.
    
In retaliation, the police resorted to baton-charge and teargas 
shelling to disperse the agitators, causing injuries to several of 
them.
    
The reports of minor clashes between the Christians and the police 
were received till the filing of the news as this seek and hide 
between the police and protesters continued till dark.

<a name="supr">Supreme Court strikes down 12 ATA clauses </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent 

ISLAMABAD, May 15: The supreme court on Friday declared 12 
provisions of the anti-terrorism act (ATA) as invalid, and brought 
special courts on a par with ordinary courts working within the 
existing judicial system.
    
Among other things, the five-member bench in a unanimous short 
order held that the power to law enforcement agencies to open fire 
on suspicion of terrorism, and accepting of a confession before a 
DSP as valid piece of evidence, were untenable and needed to be 
suitably amended.
    
The court also directed the government to make an amendment in the 
ATA to vest the appellate power in a high court instead of an 
appellate tribunal. According to legal experts, after this decision 
of the apex court those convicted under the ATA will also be able 
to approach the supreme court after a high court.
    
The ATA was enacted in August last year and was described by the 
opposition and human rights groups as an attempt by the government 
to convert Pakistan into a police state. The then chief justice, 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, had also opposed the legislation and had 
advised the government not to create a parallel judicial system.
    
The bench directed the government to make amendments in ATA to 
bring those sections in consonance with the constitution.
    
The ATA sections which were held to be invalid in their present 
form were sections 5(2)(i), 10, 14, 19(10)(b), 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 
35, and 37.
    
The five-member bench consisted of Chief Justice Ajmal Mian, 
Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, Justice 
Raja Afrasiab Khan and Justice Bashir Jehangiri.
    
The court held that section 5(2)(1) of ATA was invalid to the 
extent it authorized an officer of the police, armed forces or 
civil armed forces charged with the duty of preventing terrorism, 
to open fire or order the opening of fire against a person who in 
his opinion was likely to commit a terrorist act.
    
It held that section 10 of ATA, which empowered the law enforcement 
agencies to enter any premises for search, was invalid in its 
present form. The SC ruled that before entering the premises 
suspected to have material or records which could stir sectarian 
violence, a police officer, armed forces or civil armed forces 
personnel should record in writing reasons for search and serve on 
the person or premises concerned a copy of such reasons before 
conducting a search.
    
The SC further held that section 14 of the act that empowered the 
executive to appoint a judge to a special court without specifying 
his tenure, required to be amended to provide security of tenure in 
consonance with the concept of independence of judiciary.
    
The court also ruled that section 19(10)(b), which provided for 
trial of an accused in absentia on account of his misbehaviour in 
the court, was violative of Article 10 of the constitution and thus 
invalid.
    
The supreme court further held that section 24, which provided for 
constitution of an appellate tribunal consisting of one or two 
judges, was invalid as it militated against the independence of 
judiciary.
    
Similarly, the court held that section 25 provided finality to the 
judgment of an appellate tribunal and barring supreme court 
jurisdiction in relation to ATA, negated independence of the 
judiciary.
    
The supreme court ruled that Section 26, which made valid the 
confession of an accused before a police officer not below the rank 
of deputy superintendent of police, was violative of articles 13(b) 
and 25 of the constitution. "Section 25 of the constitution 
requires to be suitably amended by substituting the words 'by a 
police officer not below the rank of a deputy superintendent of 
police' by the words 'judicial magistrate'."
    
Section 27, which empowered an ATA judge or an appellate tribunal 
to punish any "delinquent" officer for defective investigation, was 
also declared invalid. The court held that it required to be 
amended.
    
Section 28 of the ATA, empowering an appellate tribunal under ATA 
to transfer any case from one special court to another for the 
security of the witness and accused, was also held invalid.
The SC held that section 35, empowering the government to make 
rules necessary for carrying out the process of ATA, was also 
against the concept of the independence of judiciary and violative 
of articles 175 and 203 of the constitution.
    
The court also held that section 27 of the ATA, which permitted an 
ATA judge to convict for contempt of court, was also invalid in the 
present form and needed to be amended suitably.

<a name="belg">Belgium offers to sell 24 Mirage5 fighters </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque 

ISLAMABAD, May 11: Belgium has expressed willingness to sell 24 
Mirage5 fighter aircraft to Pakistan at a very low price.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Monday that both Pakistan and 
Belgium had decided to expand their military cooperation and that a 
broad understanding had been reached during Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif's recent visit to Belgium.
    
Sources said Belgium and Pakistan had discussed enhancement of 
military cooperation at a breakfast meeting that took place between 
Mr Nawaz Sharif and senior Belgian authorities. And as a first step 

Belgium offered to sell 24 Mirage5 aircraft to Pakistan.
    
The price of all the 24 aircraft will be about six million dollars. 
However, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was told that 2.5 million 
dollars would be charged for the upgradation of "each aircraft".
    
Pakistan was assured that the upgradation would be done in 
accordance with international standards. 
    
The planes will then be at a par with those manufactured by France, 
USA and Russia.
    
These 24 aircraft, sources said, had been declared surplus by the 
Belgian government due to downsizing in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO).
    
The sources said some other military equipment was also declared 
surplus by the authorities in Brussels and Pakistan had been 
offered to purchase them.
    
"We had a very good trip to Brussels this time and both sides not 
only decided to expand their economic ties but also agreed to 
increase defence cooperation," said an official who toured with the 
prime minister. 
     
He said a new chapter in military cooperation could soon be opened 
between Pakistan and Belgium.
    
Sources said Mr Nawaz Sharif would soon have a high-level meeting 
with the three services chiefs to apprise them about the 
possibilities of enhancing military cooperation with Belgium in the 
light of his discussions in Brussels.

<a name="mass">Mass Transit project goes to cold storage</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, May 14: The Karachi Mass Transit Project (KMTP) has been 
put in a cold storage as the Planning Commission has made no 
allocation for the $586million project in the Public Sector 
Development Programme (PSDP) for 1998-99.
    
According to sources, the PSDP has made a proposed allocation of 
only Rs 625 million for the National Mass Transit Authority(NMTA) 
for 1998-99 under the head of public sector organisations and these 
funds would be exclusively used for the Lahore mass transit 
project.
    
The NMTA is now dealing only with the Lahore mass transit project. 
   
A memorandum of understanding signed by federal and Sindh 
governments and executing agency Indus Mass Transit Company in 
December for the Karachi mass transit project explicitly states 
that the Sindh government had agreed to take charge of the 
administration of the mass transit project "subject to enactment of 
the KMTA by the provincial assembly".
    
The setting up of Karachi mass transport authority with an aim to 
centralise transport system of city was made mandatory by a high-
level meeting in Islamabad in August. 
   
The meeting, attended by officials of both federal and provincial 
governments, besides others, had resolved that the Sindh government 
set up a steering committee for the interim period (period prior to 
the formation of the KMTA).
    
A meeting of ministry of communication on March 16 in Islamabad had 
decided that the KMTP would be allocated an amount of $57.2million 
(Rs 2.6 billion) for 1998-99. This matter was later approved by the 
priorities committee following Sindh government's confirmation of 
the allocation.
    
According to sources, the proposed allocation in the PSDP is meant 
for the Lahore mass transit project for 1998-99 in which federal 
government has a 20 per cent share as the size of the allocation is 
not even one-fourth of the amount committed by the federal 
government for the KMTP in March.
    
As far as the Sindh government is concerned, the chief minister has 
yet to give approval to the summaries pertaining to the setting up 
of Karachi Metropolitan Transport Authority and a steering 
committee comprising, among others, federal and provincial 
government officials to clear the backlog for achieving a financial 
close by July.
    
"It appears that the Punjab chief minister is taking great pains 
and demonstrating leadership to have the Lahore mass transit on 
ground as compared to the Sindh chief minister who is finding no 
time for the KMPT," the sources said.
    
The sources added that due the complacency of the Sindh chief 
minister the KMTP was totally ignored in the PSDP for the 1998- 99.
    
The KMTA, which has been given an initial task of heading the 
$586million Karachi Mass Transit Project, will later devise 
mechanisms to take over the charge of all transport activities in 
the city which, at present, are under the control of regional 
transport authorities and provincial transport department.

<a name="govt">Govt warns oil dealers against raising prices</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, May 9: A spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum said on 
Friday night that the government would not allow oil dealers to 
raise prices at their whim.
    
The spokesman said this after a high-level meeting of the ministry 
of petroleum here. 
    
He said under the constitution, only the Federal Ministry had a 
right to determine the prices of petroleum products.
    
If an organization arrogated to itself this power, the government 
would not hesitate to take action. He said the Ministry of 
Petroleum and Natural Resources was conversant with the problems of 
petroleum dealers, contractors and other people affiliated with 
this sector and had sympathies with them but it was essential that 
for the resolution of the problems, proper way should be adopted.
    
He said the demand for raise in commission by petroleum dealers 
could be considered only until the unilateral and unlawful service 
charges were not withdrawn.
    
The Press release said on the one hand, the ministry would ensure 
that after the withdrawal of service charges already imposed, 
immediate and positive measures be taken to resolve genuine demands 
of the dealers.
    
On the other hand, the notification added, if the service charges 
by the dealers were not withdrawn, the government would be 
constrained to take all those measures which would do away with 
this unlawful step.

<a name="ccil">CCI lays emphasis on hydel power production</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, May 9: The Council of Common Interests (CCI) on Saturday 
laid stress on hydel power generation to remove the growing 
financial difficulties of the government.
    
A special meeting of the CCI was held here under the chairmanship 
of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and its entire thrust was on the 
generation of hydel power.
    
"The CCI today decided to go for the hydel power generation that is 
less expensive and can adequately look after all the power 
requirements of the country," said the Minister for Finance Senator 
Sartaj Aziz.
    
He told Dawn that the CCI had been informed about the new hydel 
policy which was ready and would amply cover the hydel power 
generation. "We have decided to generate cheap electricity compared 
to the Independent Power Projects (IPPs), which are generating 
thermal power and are charging high tariffs," the finance minister 
said.
    
Responding to a question, he said the issue of the distribution of 
water among the provinces had also been discussed in the light of 
water accord. "The provinces have asked for more funds to develop 
their water resources," he added.
    
Mr Aziz denied that differences had emerged among the provinces 
over the resource formula and that they had complained about less 
funding.
    
He said the prime minister had assured the provinces that they 
would get enough funds to undertake their development programmes 
during the next financial year.
    
Informed sources said the CCI meeting had been convened to discuss 
the construction of the controversial Kalabagh dam for which the 
World Bank was still ready to offer about $9 billion. The prime 
minister, the sources said, had stressed the need for early 
construction of the Kalabagh dam so that the shortage of 
electricity could be removed by spending less funds compared to 
thermal power.
    
About the World Bank financial support, its Vice President for 
South Asian region Mieko Nishimizu, who was currently visiting 
Pakistan, has reportedly assured the authorities of all possible 
financial support for hydel power projects, including the Kalabagh 
dam.
    
However, the sources said NWFP Chief Minister Mehtab Abbasi and 
Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi had expressed their reservations 
about the construction of the Kalabagh dam and expressed 
apprehensions that the issue could spark serious tension in their 
provinces.

desecration of holy verses allegedly by a Christian youth.
    
The city life has come to a standstill for the last four days due 
to tension which erupted after the suicide by Bishop Dr John 
Joseph, and desecration of holy verses by a Christian youth on 
Friday last when the Christians took out rallies against the 
blasphemy laws.
    
All shopping centres in the city remained closed. Even mohalla 
shops did not open as people were seen running from pillar to post 
for purchase of daily-use items.
    
Protesters attacked vehicles plying on roads with hockey sticks 
which confined the people to their houses.
    
Due to heavy tear gas shelling and baton-charge by police in seven 
city areas to disperse unruly mobs, about 13 people and two 
policemen received minor injuries.
    
On Sunday night and Monday morning, in almost all mosques of the 
city, religious leaders made announcements urging people to hold 
demonstrations and take out processions from their localities and 
assemble at the Clock Tower intersection of the city to express 
their resentment over the sacrilege.
    
Despite picketing by police commandos, reserve forces and jawans of 
the Frontier and Punjab Constabulary on major and interior roads of 
the city, at least 15 processions were brought out by the youth. 
The processionists were carrying sticks, hockeys, iron rods and 
placards.
    
A group of the youths also attacked the Christian Town on Narwala 
Road and pelted stones on the houses and shops of the Christians 
but a heavy police contingent dispersed them.
    
Meanwhile, police arrested 11 youngsters during the hide and seek 
between the police and people. However, the arrested persons were 
got released on the intervention of local leaders of the traders 
and religious organizations.
    
A group of angry youth here on Monday attacked the house of Ranjha 
Masih, who allegedly had desecrated the "Kalima" on last Friday, 
but luckily the inmates of the house were not present there.

<a name="balo">Balochistan seeks due share in Indus water</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

QUETTA, May 10: The Balochistan government on Sunday demanded of 
the federal government its legitimate share in the Indus water 
through the proposed Katchi canal.
    
Clarifying news reports about the meeting of the Council of Common 
Interests, a spokesman for the Chief Minister House said that the 
federal government should implement the Water Apportionment Accord 
in its totality among the four provinces.
    
The spokesman said Balochistan government at the CCI meeting had 
taken the stand that the Kalabagh dam had become a political issue 
rather than a technical problem as reported.
    
He urged the federal government for redressing the grievances of 
Sindh and NWFP by taking their political leaders and provincial 
governments into confidence and finding an amicable solution to the 
Kalabagh dam issue.
    
He said that the Balochistan government had made it clear at the 
CCI meeting that its assembly along with that of Sindh and NWFP 
assemblies had passed a resolution against the construction of 
Kalabagh dam.
    
The spokesman called for providing opportunities to the chief 
ministers and provincial governments of the NWFP and Sindh to seek 
redressal of their problems and take political leaders and 
assemblies of these provinces into confidence before taking a final 
decision in this regard.
    
The spokesman called for mutual respect for the constitutional 
rights of all the provinces by adopting a non-discriminatory 
attitude and recognising the legitimate rights of other provinces 
so that people of all the provinces could join the national 
mainstream.
    
He said, "only in this way we can prepare and implement the 
development plans of national importance and receive big ovation of 
people throughout the country."
    
He said people be allowed to demonstrate their will without any 
reservation for the development of the country using their 
resources and technical knowledge in this regard.

<a name="scre">SC returns MQM petition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent 

ISLAMABAD, May 13: The supreme court on Wednesday returned the 
petition of Senator Aftab Shaikh of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) 
asking the apex court to direct the Sindh advocate general to 
implead Mr Altaf Hussain as "necessary party" in the government 
appeal in Major Kaleem case.
    
The petition was returned on the ground that according to supreme 
court rules, the aggrieved person should himself file an 
application in person or through advocate-on-record for impleading 
him as party.
    
The SC office was of the view that there was no need for invoking 
the original jurisdiction of the apex court and if Altaf Hussain 
wanted to become a party he should file an application for this 
purpose.
    
Shaikh Aftab Hussain had stated that the government of Sindh, which 
had filed an appeal in the supreme court impugning the Sindh High 
Court judgment in Major Kaleem case, had excluded the name of MQM 
chief from the list of respondents to give an impression that Mr 
Altaf Hussain was in league with the government.
    
The petitioner said Altaf Hussain was willing to face trial along 
with the co-accused, and he should be treated like any other 
accused.
    
He had asked the supreme court to direct the Sindh government to 
implead Mr Altaf Hussain as a party in the Major Kaleem case.

<a name="bena">Benazir vows to fight on people's side</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

LONDON, May 10: Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said on Sunday 
that she was being punished for pursuing the Ghauri missile project 
and strengthening Pakistan's security.
    
"I would not have been facing this punishment (of media trial and 
cooked-up cases) had I not carried out the Ghauri missile project 
for strengthening the country's security," she told reporters at a 
news conference in a London hotel on Sunday.
    
"My father (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) gave the nuclear programme to the 
country and the punishment he received for that is well-known to 
the people of Pakistan," she said while indirectly saying that the 
former prime minister had been sent to the gallows at the instance 
of the superpower for pursuing the nuclear programme.
    
"Now I am facing the consequences of giving Pakistan Ghauri missile 
and strengthening its security," she said referring to the witch-
hunt carried out against her by the government at national and 
international levels.
    
She said the government was even "misusing" the international 
agreements on narcotics trafficking by seeking the help of Britain 
and Switzerland under this provision to collect evidence against 
her jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari.
    
She said the government had so far spent $15 million on the media 
trial against her family and added that this media trial was a part 
of the "punishment" for carrying out the Ghauri missile project.
    
She said the government had been feeding the statements of former 
drug traffickers, who had been extradited by the PPP government to 
the US after fulfilling all legal formalities, to the international 
and national media. "What value these statements carry which are 
given by those who were extradited by the PPP government?" she 
asked.
    
Benazir Bhutto also said she had been told that another such media 
attack would be launched against her by weekly The Times magazine. 
"My reports are that the government has provided the magazine with 
the statements of these drug traffickers who were extradited to the 
United States by the PPP government."
    
Ms Bhutto told reporters she was being advised not to return to the 
country as she would be arrested by the government but declared: "I 
will be going back, no matter what happens to me because I know he 
(Nawaz Sharif) is anti-people and systematically destroying the 
democratic institutions in the country."
    
She said she would return to the country to stand on the side of 
the people who were facing a civilian martial law in the country.
    
She said she would not stay away from the country at a time when 
judiciary was being attacked, the press freedom was being 
suppressed, the public-sector labour was being made redundant, 
rights of minorities were being suppressed, religious freedom was 
under threat and there was no security of lives in the country.
    
"We are to defend the values like the freedom of press, an 
impartial bureaucracy, security of life and rights of women and 
minorities and I will definitely go back."
    
She said the government had failed to bring even a single case of 
corruption against her since it came to power. "Now they are using 
the international agreements on narcotics against us and sought 
help of Britain and Switzerland under these laws. By using 
international narcotics agreements the government has in fact 
accepted its defeat."
    
She said she had informed the people of Pakistan against the 
conspiracy that was being hatched against her when she had been the 
prime minister and her brother was murdered. Instead of arresting 
the murderers, my own husband was involved in the murder case, she 
recalled.

<a name="imfs">IMF seeks CBR help for physical inspection</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, May 15: The International Monetary Fund appraisal team 
has asked the Central Board of Revenue to assist in launching a 
physical inspection of the taxpaying-capacity in Pakistan.
    
The proposal includes visits by IMF officials of the business 
locations and shops, banks and other finance/trade related 
institutions.
    
The request from the fund team came after a scrutiny of records of 
collection of sales tax during the last 10 months of the current 
financial year.
    
The team is conducting scrutiny of records of all the four tax-
heads; sales tax, customs duty, income tax and central excise duty 
which will continue till May 19.
    
On Friday, the team started looking into the ledgers of income tax, 
at the Central Board of Revenue.
    
The fund team members, Juan Paul Bodin, Michael Keen and Juan Toro 
have so far been scanning the records of sales tax with a focus on 
methods of implementation of the tax after its rate being reduced 
to 12.5 per cent, from 21, 18 and 15 per cent in the federal budget 
1997-98.
    
Putting queries to a large number of CBR officials about the causes 
of failure in collecting the sales tax as per the current year's 
target, they are reported to have found the answers 
"unsatisfactory", as one source told Dawn.
    
The team members communicated their agenda to the CBR officials 
explaining that they would go on a physical check of factories, 
shops, banks and other places if they were not satisfied with the 
standard of record keeping on tax collection by the CBR.
    
Some CBR officials said the fund team is "actually not expressing 
any confidence in us". According to some other officials, the fund 
consultants have a long experience in dealing with the Pakistani 
tax collecting machinery and have been finding most of the figures 
on collection and methods of implementing the tax as "incorrect, 
inflated and misleading".
    
The team members planning to visit shops are reported to have 
selected for sample shops with their tax sheets, to asses whether 
they have been depositing the due amount of ST over the past some 
months.
    
They have also focussed on the figures of tax deposit under the 
Traders' Enrolment Certificates and have been asking questions to 
determine as to what kind of response the government had expected 
from this scheme, imposed in lieu of the fund-backed retail tax and 
the actual deposit of tax under TECs.
    
To launch a physical survey of the shops to see whether their 
sales, as per the category they had got themselves enrolled for, 
were in accordance with the turnover declared. The CBR is reported 
to have made preparations for such a survey.
    
The survey is part of the study of the fulfilment of commitments 
made by the present government, for release of next tranche from 
the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

<a name="noac">No accord on power rates without LHC permission</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, May 13: The Lahore High Court has barred the federal 
government or its Private Power Infrastructure Board from entering 
into any new agreement with the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) 
pending the petitions against exorbitant power tariffs without the 
court's permission.
    
Justice Ihsanul Haq Chaudhry, who is hearing the petitions filed by 
the WAPDA Hydro-electric Union and a public interest litigant, 
allowed two IPPs, Hubco and Kapco, to file written statements 
within two days. The extension was not opposed by the petitioners' 
counsel, Advocates Maqbool Sadiq and Shakeelur Rehman Khan.
    
The restraint order was passed on a miscellaneous application filed 
by the petitioners that the federal ministry of water and power and 
WAPDA have failed to file written statements in reply to their 
petitions despite a court order of January 27, 1998. The delay is 
due to government efforts for out-of-court settlement that would 
endorse the original agreements with minor adjustments here and 
there but without any substantial relief to the consumer. Advocate 
Maqbool Sadiq said the government is bound to fix power electricity 
rates in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment in the 1997 
case of M/s Gadoon Textiles versus WAPDA. 
   
The judgment declared that utility rates should be determined in 
consultation with public consumer representatives and reasonable 
profit should be charged after calculating the maintenance and 
production costs. 
   
The counsel said the total demand for electricity in the country 
stood at 7,800 megawatts against a total thermal-hydel generation 
capacity of 9,100MW. In fact, WAPDA has to curtail its own 
generation, which costs much less, to accommodate the IPP supply, 
which it must in any case pay for under the power purchase 
agreements (PPAs).
    
The court expressed its surprise on how the government could agree 
to such stipulations. It fixed May 18 as the next date of hearing. 
However, the petitions may be referred to a larger bench 
recommended to hear the petition against Hubco power tariff rate, 
which is allegedly higher than that of all the other IPPs. The 
bench is likely to comprise both Justice Ihsanul Haq Chaudhry and 
Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum.

<a name="allb">All bank branches to accept utility bills</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, May 15: All the branches of five major local banks across 
the country will accept utility bills from 9:00 a.m till 5:00 p.m 
with one hour lunch break from 1:00-2:00 p.m. At present some 
selected branches of the five major banks accept utility billsand 
majority of them deny the facility after the lunch break.
    
A decision to this effect was taken at a high level meeting held at 
the State Bank office here.
    
Presided over by the chairman of divisional Khidmat Committee, MNA 
Mian Ejaz Shaffi the meeting was attended by senior officials of 
the State Bank and representatives of five major banks and utility 
companies.
    
"The decision will take effect immediately," Shaffi told Dawn on 
telephone. He said the State Bank authorities had assured to issue 
instructions in this regard to the five major banks on Saturday. 
The five banks are (i) National Bank (ii) Habib Bank (iii) United 
Bank (iv) Allied Bank and (v) Muslim Commercial Bank.
    
He said it was agreed that Khidmat committees would oversee the 
process of utility bills collection at the branch level. "If the 
committees spot any irregularity they will report it to the State 
Bank...the State Bank will send its inspectors to verify the 
complaints and take action."
    
He said the banks were warned not to deviate from the new timings 
set for bills collection and refrain from changing the schedule on 
their own.
    
Shaffi said it was also agreed that the new system will be allowed 
to run for three months before making any changes. "If need be we 
would ask the banksafter three monthsto keep their branches open 
for bills collection even on Sundays."
    
A source privy to the meeting said the representatives of the banks 
were of the view that the bills collection charges were below the 
cost. At present banks charge Rs 2 on each bills.
    
The source said the chairman of the Khidmat committee told the 
bankers since every bank handled three to four types of utility 
bills the total bills collection charges came to Rs 6-8 in case of 
each bank which was not bad. All the five major banks invariably 
accept at least four utility billselectricity bills, water bills, 
gas bills and telephone bills. Shaffi, however, asked the bankers 
to submit a detailed working showing their cost of bills 
collection.

Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 13: Minister for Finance Senator Sartaj Aziz said 
here on Wednesday that Pakistan has lined up over 5 billion dollar 
foreign assistance because of effectively implementing economic 
reforms programme in Pakistan during the last one year.
    
"Foreign commitments worth 3 billion dollars have been made for the 
current financial year, while 2 billion dollars are being offered 
to us for Social Action Programme (SAP), he further stated.
    
Speaking at a news conference after the end of the 2-day meeting of 
the Pakistan Development Forum (PDF), he said that the government 
has received a very encouraging response from the donors community 
to continue implementing the structural reform programme.
    
Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Dr Hafeez Pasha, who was also 
present on the occasion told a reporter that funding for SAP has 
adequately been arranged. "Funds worth 2 billion dollars have been 
managed from the donors out of 10 billion dollar SAP", he said.
    
The minister for finance said that the government expected to have 
2.5 to 3 billion dollar foreign assistance during the next 
financial year. He said that the World bank has increased its 
volume of assistance from 600 to 850 million dollar annually.
    
Responding to a question, Aziz said that the PDF, previously known 
as Aid to Pakistan Consortium has stopped holding pledging session. 
He said that a 7 billion dollar aid pipeline, built over the years, 
was being used for having annual assistance from the donors.
    
He said that the PDF meeting, which was held for the first time in 
Pakistan, has provided an opportunity to have more closer inter-
action with the donor community. He pointed out that the issues 
like inflation, budget deficit, current account deficit and 
development programmes were extensively discussed during the 
meeting.
    
"The meeting believed that more steps are needed to promote Foreign 
Direct Investment (FDI), increase exports and revenues of the 
country", the finance minister pointed out.
    
The issue of tax reforms as well as restructuring of the WAPDA were 
also discussed with donors which are impinging the idea of 
improving the concept of good governance. He said that the donors 
also called for reducing non-development expenditure and allocating 
more funds for health and education.
    
To a question, Aziz said that some participants also called for 
improving law and order situation. "And we have told them all 
necessary measures have been taken to improve law and order 
situation".

Intikhab Amir
    
PESHAWAR, May 14: The Customs and Central Excise Collectorate, 
Peshawar is expecting to achieve Rs7800 million central excise duty 
(CED) target for the 1997-98 fiscal having, so far, collected 82.21 
per cent of the stipulated amount in the first 10 months.
    
The collections on account of CED stood at Rs6412.66 million on 
April 30, last, against the target of Rs 7800 million.
    
Though slightly missing the target (by -1.34 per cent) of Rs6500 
million, internally fixed by the collectorate's authorities for the 
first ten months of the current financial year, the recoveries made 
during that period recorded significant improvement (41.44 per 
cent) as compared to CED collections made in the corresponding 
period of the last financial year.
    
At the close of April, 1997, CED collections stood at Rs4533.74 
million. The overall collections at the end of the financial year 
on June 30, 1997 amounted to Rs 5913.89 million.

The improvement in collections, this time round, is due mainly to 
sharp increase in CED collected on cigarettes industry which rose 
by 66.75 per cent. During the first 10 months of this year CED on 
cigarettes stood at Rs2839.16 million, whereas, in the 
corresponding period during the last financial year recoveries had 
ended up at Rs1697.22 million.
    
The CED collected on cigarettes till April, this year, recorded an 
increase of 20.47 per cent as compared to the target internally set 
by the collectorate for the first ten months of the current 
financial year. The authorities had fixed a target of Rs2349.29 
million under this head till April, 1998. With a collection of 
Rs2830.16 million at the end of the 10th month of the current 
financial year. The collectorate also achieved the target of 
Rs2819.15 million set for it, by the CBR, for the current fiscal on 
account of CED on cigarettes.

ISLAMABAD, May 14: The Chairman, Corporate Law Authority, Shamim 
Ahmed Khan, while presiding over a meeting of the Coordination 
Committee of CLA and stock exchanges here on Thursday, directed the 
managements of all the three bourses to resolve the growing 
complaints of investors against the brokers.
    
Besides senior officials of CLA, the meeting was attended by Yasin 
Lakhani, Khawaja Hamad Saeed and Farooq Zafar, Chairmen, 
respectively, of the stock exchanges of Karachi, Lahore and 
Islamabad as well as their newly appointed managing directors 
(secretary, in the case of ISE).
    
Meeting after more than 16 months, the Coordination Committee 
mainly reviewed the progress in implementing the capital sector 
reforms under $250 million credit. These reforms have to be 
implemented from July 1 next. It specifically appreciated the 
induction of outside directors and appointment of professional 
managing directors. The meeting also reviewed the impact of those 
parts of the reforms package on the capital market that have been 
implemented so far.
    
The items relevant to the ADB Capital Market Reforms and on the 
agenda for review were, inter alia: Strengthening of various 
departments of the stock exchanges; automation of trading; 
corporisation of stock brokers; establishment of Members Protection 
Fund; strengthening of defaulter & disciplinary procedures and 
their enforcement; establishment of Investors Protection Fund by 
the stock exchanges; and setting-up of National Clearing and 
Settlement System.
    
Although, the meeting had a rather longish agenda comprising 15 
items, some of these were discussed only cursorily, while others 
were not even touched for want of time because the CLA Chairman was 
called to a meeting with the finance minister. A senior CLA 
official, however, contended that the meeting had been called 
mainly for a tete-a-tete with the newly elected chairmen and MDs of 
the bourses.

<a name="noti">Notices to IPPs for one-to-one meeting</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 14: The Ministry of Water and Power here on Thursday 
decided to issue notices to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) for 
a one-to-one meeting with them to get their power tariffs reduced.
    
Official sources told Dawn that the Minister for Water and Power, 
Raja Nadir Pervaiz on Thursday signed a letter that sought to 
immediately dispatch notices to the IPPs. These notices were being 
issued to 9 IPPs which, according to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, 
have assured to lower their tariffs.
    
However, sources said that these 9 IPPs have the generating 
capacity of 100 to 120 mw. Some of them were operating or were to 
operate on merely 10 to 20 mw. "Soon they will have these notices 
with them", said an official who believed that one-to-one meeting 
with every IPPs will start taking place next week.
    
But the high officials of the ministry of water and power, sources 
said, were disturbed as no formula could have been finalized with 
relatively big IPPs. Some said that the prime minister's address to 
the nation was premature and should have been organized only when 
things would have settled with the owners of the bigger IPPs.
    
Participants of the Pakistan Development Forum (PDF), which met 
here on May 12 and 13, did not approve the government's measures to 
deal with the IPPs. They have reportedly threatened to suspend 
their economic assistance in case the IPPs were continued to be 
chased by the officials of the Ehtesab (Accountability) Bureau.
    
Moreover, the meeting of the Ambassadors of Japan, USA, England and 
Germany with Minister for Law and Justice Khalid Anwar on Tuesday 
last proved very significant in which they adopted tough line 
against the government. They reportedly called for halting 
investigation against the IPPs. They said that it will only 
undermine the government's efforts to boost foreign investment in 
Pakistan.
    
Meanwhile, it was also learnt that although the government has held 
detailed discussion with the PDF members over the issue of IPPs, 
the minister for law and justice was likely to visit Washington in 
the third week of this month to hold further talks with the 
officials of the World Bank, IMF and the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) for getting power tariffs reduced by the IPPs.

foreign assistance in 1998-99 and it expects the commitments of 2.1

A 2-day PDF meeting starting from Tuesday will take into account 
the aid request of the Pakistan government. Although it would not 
be pledging session, still the Planning Commission prepared a 
document to be discussed PDF, previously known as Aid to Pakistan 
Consortium.
    
"Gross disbursements during 1998-99 are projected at 2.9 billion 
dollars (exactly $2963 million) of which project aid disbursements 
from the pipeline and fresh commitments will aggregate to 1,785 
million dollars", the memorandum said.

has been projected at 2 million dollars.
    
Nevertheless diplomatic sources said that issues related to cut in 
defence budget, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and considerably 
enhancing allocations for social sectors would, for the first time, 
come up for detailed discussion. They said that macroeconomic 
developments covering all the sectors of the economy were scheduled 
to be debated in the PDF meeting.
    
Sources said that the issue of cut in defence budget will be 
discussed in the light of a programme called as "Medium Term 
Framework for Five Years" which was prepared by the World Bank. The 
document calls for having good governance for eradicating 
corruption, sectarian violence and terrorism. It further stressed 
the need for removing unemployment, high population growth rate, 
improving tax administration with GDP tax ratio of 13 per cent, 
improving the allocations for public spending, reducing tax 
evasion, levying General Sales Tax, imposing tax on agriculture 
income, curtailing the discretionary  powers, improving law and 
order situation, protecting Social Action Programme (SAP) from any 
budgetary cut and redoubling the efforts for the privatization 
process.
    
Sources said that the PDF meeting will discuss the overall 
performance of the Pakistani economy in the light of various 
benchmarks set by the IMF. The meeting will be presided over by Ms 
Mieko Nishimizue, Vice President of the World Bank. Minister for 
Finance Sartaj Aziz will lead the Pakistan side. The meeting will 
also be attended by high ranking delegates from 17 countries and 15 
international agencies which are collaborating and assisting in its 
development efforts.
    
A distinctive feature of the meeting is a special session on 
business environment for the private sector which will specifically 
take up issues relating to finance and capital market; 
infrastructure and power; trade and industry. Over 40 chief 
executives of companies and corporations will participate in the 
session. 
   
Discussing the outlook for 1998-99, the document of the Planning 
Commission, which will come up for discussion by the members of the 
PDF, said the government expected that the next financial year will 
see further improvements in the trade accounts reflecting a higher 
growth in exports than imports.

<a name="bene">Benefits of tax incentives to exporters reviewed </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, May 11: The Export Board of commerce ministry reviewed 
on Monday the performance of different relevant government agencies 
in the follow-up of a report on benefits of the tax incentives 
offered to exporters for the current trade year.
    
The meeting was told that a priority list of items was finalized 
for sending up to the high-ups of all the relevant government 
organizations.
    
These items are being deemed as largest exportable ones in view of 
the tax incentives offered by the government and the openings in 
the international market for them, in the recent months.
    
The meeting also reviewed the quantity wise export of non-cotton 
items in the period between July 1997 and April 1998, and noted 
with concern that 10 out of 28 of these export items showed a 
marked decrease in terms of quantity and value, as against the 
export of these items made in the same period, last financial year.
    
These items are rice, leather, textile manufacture, knitwear, 
bedwear, readymade garments, synthetic textile fabrics, sports 
goods, leather manufacture, and surgical and medical instruments.
    
The meeting took note of the fact that these figures might, by the 
end of the current financial year, falsify the government claims of 
having accomplished in the exports, in these sectors. The meeting 
was offered to examine a report from most of these sectors, 
indicating that the exports have been falling both in terms of 
quantity and value, while the statistics submitted on these told a 
different story, which needed rectification, to provide the 
government with the sense of urgency to do something for turning 
around the prevailing position.
    
The government set ambitious targets for exports for the new 
financial year. The causes of this slide were analysed in the 
backdrop of various measures adopted by the government.
    
Reports from various industrial and business chambers on export and 
the indicators were examined which pointed out that the failures 
were occurring due to high cost of production and complicated 
procedure of export.

The meeting considered different ways and means to preempt the 
additional factors feared to come and play their role in 
discouraging exports, during the next few months. The idea of 
creating a development bank for promoting exports and to 
revolutionize the performance of the Export Promotion Bureau, also 
came up for discussion, sources told Dawn.
    
The need was felt that the EPB should be directed to concentrate on 
adding new items to the export list, beside ensuring products 
identification, apart from performing as exclusively a regulatory 
authority.
    
The meeting examined different proposals for maximizing the export 
of value-added goods and discouraging the primary and semi-finished 
goods.
    
It also examined the proposal for simplifying the procedure for 
textile exports. A workable procedure concerning the refund of 
sales tax in consultation with the representative organizations of 
business and trade, was also discussed.
    
A review was also conducted on performance on recently communicated 
instructions from the government of Pakistan to its missions 
abroad, to activate them to help promote exports from Pakistan. It 
was brought into the notice of the meeting that all the facilities 
demanded by a number of missions in this regard, had been provided 
for, but the situation did not improve.
    
The next meeting of the EPB to be scheduled shortly, will examine 
the ways and means suggested for this purpose by different relevant 
agencies, in the light of the demands made by exporters, during the 
July-April period of the current financial year.

<a name="355b">Rs355bn revenue expected next year</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Raja Zulfikar

ISLAMABAD, May 12: The finance ministry is anticipating no more 
than Rs355 billion of revenue next year against the revised target 
of Rs305 billion for the current year.
    
However, undeterred by serious shortfalls in revenue collection 
target during the current year, the government has reportedly asked 
the finance ministry to prepare two strategies for fixing the 
revenue targets for the next financial year at Rs 500 billion and 
Rs375 billion respectively.
    
Sources said the government had asked the finance ministry for two 
strategies in view of its decision to increase the size of the 
annual development plan from the existing Rs90 billion to Rs120 
billion and to reduce budget deficit.
    
The original revenue target for the current year was Rs327 billion 
which was revised downward to Rs305 billion in the month of 
December 1997 after the collection trends in the first two quarters 
indicated that the original target was not achievable.
    
In the first three quarters, the collection came to about Rs200 
billion with Rs105 billion still to be collected in the last 
quarter.
    
The finance ministry, sources told Dawn, has attributed the 
shortfall of Rs26 billion among other factors to a slow down in the 
economic growth, reduction in imports, non-implementation of 
certain budgetary measures and amnesty scheme.

<a name="stoc">Stocks break bearish spell, recover 14 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 15: Stocks broke the protracted bearish spell on 
Friday, caused by the Indian nuclear tests and power tariff issue, 
as blue chips came in for strong short-covering at the lower levels 
and finished a shade higher under the lead of massively battered 
Hub-Power and PTCL.
    
After recovering over 20 points before the closing bell, the KSE 
100-share index finally recovered about 14 points or Rs 1.478 
billion in the market capitalization.
    
Incidentally, the market advance was led by energy sector as most 
of them came in for strong support at the attractively lower 
levels, apparently pointing to some positive development on the 
tariff cut issue.
    
Some dealers said bulk of the support was based on speculative 
thinking after the Lahore High Court stay in regard to cancellation 
of power purchase agreement with Wak Power, Port Qasim-based plant.
    
Investors covered positions in Hub-Power and other foreign energy 
shares on the perception that they too could benefit from the 
Lahore High Court verdict, they added.
    
"The chief stimulant, which seems to have given the much-needed 
psychological boost to the market, is rumours that Pakistan may 
also denote nuclear device possibly by Sunday next,� analysts said.
    
They said the security fears might be allayed but the advent of 
nuclear weapon race in the region has its own long-term 
implications to which no one is paying heed.
    
However, in any case, a section of bargain-hunters and speculators 
was back in the rings and made active covering purchases at the 
attractively lower levels as "in their opinion there is no harm to 
play on short-term basis in the pivotals.�
    
After having received massive battering during the last four 
sessions, falling by over 130 points, the KSE 100-share index 
managed to finish partially recovered at 1,426.16 as compared to 
1,412.36 a day earlier, showing an increase of 13.80 points.
    
The market capitalization also recovered Rs 1.428 billion but 
stayed below the Rs 400 billion mark at Rs 398 billion.
    
"But we don�t think that the market is out of woods as negative 
external factors, which could make or mar its future outlook, are 
very much there,� said a leading floor broker.
    
However, one thing is certain that it has absorbed shock of the 
history after the Indian nuclear tests and there are "no fear of 
its imminent collapse�, as predicted by some financial analysts 
apparently reading it with the power tariff issue and its 
implications for the foreign investors.
Shell Pakistan and Lever Brothers, which rose by Rs 4 to Rs 30, led 
the list of gainers. Other good gainers included leading shares 
such as Metropolitan Bank, Soneri Bank, Adamjee Insurance, Delta 
Insurance, New Jubilee Insurance, Balochistan Wheels and Al-Ghazi 
Tractors, which posted gains ranging from one rupee to Rs 3.
 
Prominent losers included leading shares, notably Fazal Cloth and 
BOC Pakistan, falling by Rs 5.75 and Rs 10. They were followed by 
Al-Faysal Bank, Pakistan Oilfields, Telecard, Pakistan Gum 
Chemicals, Sindh Alkalis and Shezan International, which suffered 
decline ranging from one rupee to Rs 5.
    
Trading volume fell to 70 million shares from the previous 142 
million shares as gainers managed to force a modest edge over 
losers at 66 to 45 with 50 shares holding on to the last levels.
    
Hub-Power came in for strong covering purchases, up Rs 1.15 at Rs 
34.80 on 37 million shares, followed by PTCL, another market 
leader, higher 35 paisa at Rs 28.50 on 26 million shares, ICI 
Pakistan, up 45 paisa at Rs 15.35 on 4.269 million shares, Southern 
Electric, higher 40 paisa at Rs 6.10 on 0.957 million shares, and 
Dawood Leasing, lower 35 paisa at Rs 5.10 on 0.393 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, 
unchanged on 0.358 million shares, followed by Sui Southern, up 25 
paisa on 0.248 million shares, KESC, firm 15 paisa on 0.170 million 
shares, and Sui Northern, higher 35 paisa on 0.171 million shares.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Three shares came in for trading and ended 
lower on 4,000 shares. The largest turnover of 2,000 shares was 
noted in Bolan Casting, which suffered a fractional decline.
    
BOARD MEETINGS: Tritex Cotton, Premier Insurance, Bilal Fibre and 
Shahtaj Textiles on May 19, 21, 22 and 25 respectively.

<a name="stor">Storming of the Supreme Court - 5</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

ON April 4, the Bench presided over by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, 
sitting with Justices Munawar Ahmad Mirza and Abdur Rahman Khan, 
now inquiring into the pre-planned Storming of the Supreme Court by 
parliamentarians, members and supporters of the PML on November 28, 
1997 heard the statements of three witnesses.
    
Media-wizard who knows all the tricks of the political trade, 
Hussain Haqqani, filed his affidavit, as did Altaf Hussain Bhatti 
of Asas / Lashkar, and Aslam Butt of the Frontier Post.
    
Haqqani suggested that the November 28 video recordings of the 
Supreme Court CCTV cameras, and those made by the various TV crews, 
be shown on PTV, and members of the general public invited to 
identify any recognizable individuals. This is in line with the 
action taken by the Tribunal that inquired into Murtaza Bhutto's 
murder, also presided over by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, which had 
"published a notice in the newspapers that anyone in possession of 
any information regarding the incident in question may send his 
name and address and an affidavit to the Registrar of the 
Tribunal...".
    
Brave Bhatti, shrugging off all 'inconveniences', filed his 
affidavit, written in Urdu, relevant translated portions of which 
read :
    
"I was an eye-witness to whatever happened outside and inside 
Courtroom No.1 on November 28, 1997 and give this statement to 
assist the apex court of the country in my capacity as a 
responsible citizen.
    
"Whilst the Bench headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah 
comprising Justices Bashir Jehangiri, Mohammed Arif, Maimoon Kazi 
and Munir A Shaikh, was hearing the contempt of court case against 
the Prime Minister and other parliamentarians on November 27, 1997, 
Zafar Ali Shah, MNA, Advocate of the Supreme Court rose and said 
that the Chief Justice could not conduct the Court, as after the 
judgment of the Quetta Bench he was no longer CJ. Minister Chaudhry 
Nisar Ali Khan, and MNAs/MPAs Kabir Khan, Inamullah Niazi, Sardar 
Naseem and Advisor to PM Mushtaq Tahirkheli also stood up in Court 
in support of Zafar Ali Shah. The Muslim League crowd present also 
heckled the CJ, and when he declared that the Quetta Bench decision 
was null and void in law they shouted 'Chor , chor .'
    
"PML workers also demonstrated against the Chief Justice on 
Constitution Avenue. That evening, government sources briefed 
journalists that Justice Ajmal Mian will be sworn in as CJ the next 
morning and CJ Sajjad Ali Shah will proceed on leave.
    
"On the morning of November 28, I read a prominent headline in the 
'Daily Pakistan' announcing that the Muslim League was to 
demonstrate its strength outside the Supreme Court that day. This 
news story said that the PM and the CM Punjab had directed PML MPAs 
to bring Muslim League workers to Islamabad, via the motorway, for 
a show of strength. So, I left my home at 0700 hours and arrived by 
wagon outside the Supreme Court at 0815. At that time, traffic was 
flowing on Constitution Avenue and a few people had arrived outside 
the SC. Police reserves had just started taking their positions. 
The SSG Police group was led by Inspector Mehr Yar Mohammed. SHO 
Secretariat Jamil Hashmi and SHO Bahra Kahu, Mussarat Khan were 
also there with their men.
    
"At around 0830, people arrived in buses and wagons from the 
direction of Punjab House. Muslim League office bearers from 
Rawalpindi and Islamabad came with their workers. MSF, Nawaz Sharif 
Force and PML Women's Wing were particularly active. Efforts were 
made to get inside the SC. The gate was shut because entry was 
restricted to holders of entry passes, but certain PML 
parliamentarians were allowed entry without passes. Demonstrators 
held banners and placards reading 'We respect the Court but Sajjad 
Ali Shah is dishonest,' 'Jewish agent Sajjad Ali Shah,' 'Sajjad Ali 
Shah na manzoor,' 'Justice demands that the Chief Justice be 
dismissed.'
    
Retired Major Rashid Warraich, head of Hizbollah, was also present 
and his group held up their own placards. Women standing next to 
the main gate were singing 'Qadam barhao Nawaz Sharif, hum tumarhey 
saath hein.'
    
"At 0900 serious slogan-mongering commenced. The workers who had 
come from Lahore were led by Akhtar Rasool, MPA, and others, while 
Rawalpindi workers were accompanied by MPAs Sardar Naseem, Advocate 
Akhtar Mahmood, and Chaudhry Tanveer Khan. I know several of the 
workers who were there, including Riaz Khan, Shakil Awan, Zahid 
Qureshi, Babar Awan, Maqbool Ahmed, Mumtaz Ahmed, Farooq Khattak of 
Zia Foundation, Ali Abbas and Liaquat Ali Khan. From the Women's 
Wing in the forefront were Javedi Fatima, Nilofar Bakhtiar, Seema 
Gilani, Tahira Shaukat, Naseem Ali and Mukhtar Begum. Prominent in 
the hullabaloo were Shahbaz Goshi, Suleman Khan, Raja Hafiz, 
Chaudhry Allah Ditta and Malik Shuja.
    
"At 0930 I entered Court No. 1 after showing my pass, and sat on 
the press seats, with Khushnood Ali Khan, Rao Khalid, Wadood Qureshi,
Mushtaq Minhas, Nasir, Rashid Habib, and Zafar Shaikh. 
Present in Court were MNAs Ejazul Haq, Khwaja Asif, Asfandyar Wali, 
MPAs Ashfaq Sarwar, Raja Basharat, Chaudhry Tanveer Khan, Akhtar 
Mahmood, Sardar Naseem, Senators Raja Aurangzeb and Saifur Rahman, 
and other PML MNAs, MPAs and office bearers.
    
"In the course of the proceedings, Khwaja Asif, through his 
counsel, sought permission from the Court to leave. As the Chief 
Justice was about to show the video cassette [of the Assembly 
session at which the alleged contempt took place] MPAs Sardar 
Naseem, Ashfaq Sarwar, Akhtar Mahmood and Ali Afzal Jadoon also 
left the Courtroom. Soon thereafter, a noise was heard from outside 
and Fakhr Zaman, the reporter for Zaman , a Turkish publication, 
entered the courtroom, panting, and shouted 'My Lord, the court has 
been attacked. They will kill you. The Judges should protect 
themselves.' The CJ remarked to S M Zafar, 'Thank you, Mr Zafar, we 
are now adjourning the proceedings, but your clients will have to 
bear the responsibility.'
    
"Soon after the Judges had left the courtroom a large crowd led by 
Sardar Naseem [who had gone out shortly before] re-entered and 
assaulted Fakhr Zaman. Some journalists intervened. Outside the 
courtroom, I saw demonstrators swaggering around in different areas 
of the building, carrying flags and placards. The ML workers were 
shouting slogans : 'Sajjad kutta hai hai', 'Leghari kutta hai hai', 
'Lotay judges na manzoor'. In the main hall of the Court Khwaja 
Asif, Zafar Ali Shah, and some other ML leaders were telling the 
workers to go back, but the main door of the building was shut. 
When I looked out from the balcony of the first floor, hundreds of 
demonstrators were shouting slogans inside the Supreme Court 
grounds while police inside and outside the building stood as 
silent spectators.
    
"I remained in the Court until 1200 hours gathering material for my 
press report. I present herewith a copy of Asas of 29/11/97."
    
The attention of the Judges was drawn to the back page of the Asas 
that carried the photograph of a huge banner, made to measure, tied 
and displayed over half the full length of the front compound 
railing of the Court, reading : "Istehkam-i- Pakistan ka dushman 
Sajjad Ali Shah  Pakistan Muslim League." (Enemy of the solidarity 
of Pakistan, Sajjad Ali Shah - signed : PML).
    
The next hearing is on May 18. Another affidavit is being submitted 
to the Court to be placed on record, to which the following have 
been attached :
    
(a) A copy of letter dated November 28 1998 sent by CJ P Sajjad Ali 
Shah to President Leghari, in which he relates details of the mob 
attack that day.
    
(b) A copy of letter dated November 29, 1997, sent by President 
Leghari to PM Nawaz Sharif, forwarding a copy of the CJP's letter, 
in which he refers to : "...the disgraceful and premeditated mob 
assault on the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 28th November ...".
    
(c) A copy of the Prime Minister's November 29, 1997 rejoinder to 
the President's letter.
    
(c) A video cassette of the recording of President Leghari's 
address to the press conference held on December 2, 1998 at which 
he announced his resignation, and in which he made reference to the 
November 28 storming and desecration of the SC by the "goons and 
parliamentarians of the ruling party."
    
At the last hearing, it was requested that certain concerned 
persons be summoned by the Court to give their statements. The 
Court informed me that for this to be considered I should make an 
application. This is being done, listing the following :
    
Former President of Pakistan Farooq Leghari; the then IGP, 
Islamabad; concerned officer of the ISI; the then DIG Special 
Branch, Islamabad; the then DG IB; Punjab CM Shahbaz Sharif; SAPM 
Anwar Zahid; Senator Iqbal Haider ; Zahid Husain (Newsline and AP); 
Fakhr Zaman (Turkish news agency Zaman); Khushnood Ali Khan 
(Khabrain); Rashid Hijazi (Daily Pakistan); Faraz Hashmi (Dawn); 
Aslam Khan (Internews); Zafar Shaikh (Nawa-i-Waqt); Muhammad Ismail 
and Naveed Mairaj (Frontier Post).
    
The sooner the better that our honourable judges realize that the 
people are but trying to help revive and rehabilitate the honour of 
the Supreme Court.

<a name="aple">A plea for sanity</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

IF the recent series of Indian nuclear tests prove anything, it is 
that our leaders do not have a monopoly on criminal stupidity.
    
Indeed, Nawaz Sharif has been presented with a golden opportunity 
to demonstrate maturity and restraint; qualities, I might add, that 
have been notably lacking in the hysterical and hawkish 
pronouncements of Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub and Dr A.Q. Khan. 
Indeed, Benazir Bhutto has not been far behind in jingoism. There 
is little doubt that Nawaz Sharif is under great pressure from his 
own party, the opposition and the public to respond to the Indians 
in kind.
    
However, he must desist from an ill-considered, knee-jerk reaction.
    
The arguments for dragging our nuclear device out from the basement 
are obvious: we must show the world that we, too, are a nuclear 
power; restraint will be seen as weakness; unless we test, our 
nuclear deterrent will lose its credibility. Indeed, there are many 
hawks in policy-making or opinion-forming positions who have been 
arguing along these lines long before the Indian tests.
    
But if we weigh the pros and cons coolly and dispassionately, even 
the most rabid hawk will see that there is much to be said for a 
policy of restraint. Already, sanctions are being clamped on India 
and despite the bravado emanating from New Delhi, once trade and 
aid restrictions start to bite, even an economy as large as India's 
will be severely affected. All IMF and World Bank assistance will 
dry up; fresh foreign investment will be frozen because nobody will 
want to put money in a country that is facing international 
sanctions; and technology transfers will be sharply curtailed. 
Bilateral aid from several countries has already been blocked.
    
True, India has a huge economy, but in an age where the world is 
one large marketplace, nobody can survive on their own for very 
long. And the timing of the tests was particularly bad, coming as 
they did just before the G-8 meeting in Birmingham.
    
There is no doubt that India will dominate the agenda, and the most 
powerful leaders of the industrialized world will hammer out a 
joint strategy to ensure that India is made an example of, so that 
other nuclear threshold states do not follow suit.
    
Apart from the financial and economic fallout, the political 
repercussions of the Indian tests will be felt for a long time. For 
starters, India can bid farewell to its dream of a permanent seat 
on the UN Security Council. Next, after this crude demonstration of 
power, all the countries in the region will now mistrust India more 
than ever. Finally, the gradual improvement of ties with China  a 
process viewed with ill-concealed dismay by Islamabad  has 
probably come to a grinding halt.
    
But in strictly military terms, how have these tests changed the 
balance between India and Pakistan? After all, India carried out 
its first test in 1974, and has been known to have nuclear 
capability ever since. Pakistan attained this status a decade or so 
later. By conducting one or more tests now, we will gain very 
little and lose far more. By exploding a device, Nawaz Sharif will 
no doubt earn the applause of many, but will not add significantly 
to our defensive or offensive capability.
    
Now let us look at the advantages that would accrue from a measured 
policy of restraint. For a change, we, and not India, will occupy 
the moral high ground. Internationally, Pakistan will be viewed as 
a mature, responsible state, while Vajpayee's government is already 
being seen for what it is: a dismal collection of irresponsible 
warmongers.
    
This lofty position is no doubt unfamiliar territory to our policy-
makers, but there are a number of ways it can be exploited. For 
one, the United States could be convinced of the clear threat we 
face and the need to bolster our conventional defences if we choose 
not to go the nuclear route. As an unstated price for not testing, 
we would be in a strong bargaining position to have a major portion 
of our foreign debt and/or interest written off. Since Pakistan and 
India seem doomed to be locked in a zero-sum game in which one 
side's gains translate into the other's losses, the latter's 
isolation is to our advantage.
    
And what if we go ahead and detonate a nuclear device? The 
international response would be swift and devastating. As it is, 
our economy is tottering on the brink. A government spokesman 
recently said our requirement for foreign assistance in the next 
fiscal year is in the order of five billion dollars. If we test, we 
won't get a penny. And it's all very well to say we will eat grass, 
but I doubt there is enough grass around to sustain 140 million 
hungry Pakistanis. As it is, the stock market is reeling from what 
the government is doing to the private power producers: it will go 
through the floor if sanctions are imposed on us.
    
Another factor to keep in mind is the fact that India is surplus in 
the major food crops it needs, while we are net importers. if 
sanctions are slapped on us, our international credit rating, 
already very low, will fall to unacceptable levels, forcing us to 
pay ruinous interest rates to the banks that will still be willing 
to lend us money to pay for wheat and oil. The rupee will plunge 
against all currencies, and a devastating inflation will ravage 
what is left of the economy.
    
As these implications of conducting a nuclear test are obvious, I 
suspect one reason the BJP-led government went ahead anyway is that 
it was threatened with collapse, given the flimsy nature of the 
makeshift coalition. But having taken this step, Vajpayee has 
earned kudos from across the political spectrum, and ensured his 
government's survival, at least in the short-run. There is no such 
pressure on Nawaz Sharif. He has the luxury of not having to 
respond in kind, and turn a deaf ear to the shrill cries of hawks 
in and out of his party.
    
At the end of the day, true leadership is about taking unpopular 
decisions at times. Just because the masses bay for blood does not 
mean they should get it. For once, let us set our own agenda, and 
not let our big neighbour set it for us. Also it's our turn to be 
holier-than-thou, and join the world in reviling India; we've been 
at the receiving end for far too long.

Israrul Haq

INDIA, the fourth largest air power of the world, has not only a 
massive fleet of 1100 modern aircraft like MIG 29,30; SUs 27,29,30, 
mirage 2000 and Jaguars. Half of this fleet consists of state-of-
the-art aircraft as against Pakistan's much smaller fleet. Of this 
only about 35 F-16s are state-of-the-art craft which can perform 
the non-conventional role of delivering nuclear warheads.
    
With the induction of Russian SU-30 into the Indian fleet, 
Pakistani F-16 aircraft have been out-ranged and out-weaponed and 
thus the balance of air power has drastically moved against 
Pakistan.
    
The other day an Indian spy plane penetrated deep into Pakistan and 
carried out a reconnaissance of the Pakistani defence installation 
un-intercepted by Pakistani planes. None of these Indian state-of-
the-art aircraft is capable of penetrating into China, a supposed 
adversary of India, from their air bases. Hence they have only 
Pakistan as their targets.
    
Similarly, India's second largest army in the world is equipped 
with, among other modern weapons, a fleet of 4,000 state-of-the-art 
tanks mounted with long-range guns as against Pakistan's much 
smaller fleet which mostly consists of the tanks of the '60s 
vintage. Pakistan's latest version of Khalid tank is still not 
operational.
    
Pakistan's navy stands completely dwarfed and overwhelmed by the 
India's two giant navies, with a fleet of aircraft carriers and a 
number of nuclear submarines. India is also fairly advanced in 
developing its missile Sagarica which can be fired from submarines.
    
A few years ago, intelligence experts deposed before the US 
Congress that India's massive military build-up was primarily 
geared to the requirement of its hegemonic role.
    
The Indian Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis, an 
influential organization in India, in a public debate on February 
21, 1997 took the position that "a long-range missile system was 
necessary in order to militarily control from the strait of Malacca 
to the strait of Hurmoz (near Iran)." The Institute further made it 
clear that "the defence needs of India arise not merely from the 
need to defend its border but more so from the regional and global 
issues. India would like to see the regional and global issues to 
be resolved in the best interest of India for which it has to 
develop into a military power."
    
It should serve as an eye opener to the observers that in spite of 
India's close and cordial relations with Iran the military 
strategists of India should be so loudly thinking of militarily 
controlling the jugular vein of Iran, that is Hurmoz. In spite of 
the truce with China on border dispute, Indian Defence Minister 
George Fernandes has been flexing his military muscles against 
China. India's military posture, therefore, does not arise from the 
need of its defence and security but from its ambition of regional 
and ultimately global domination.
    
The BJP ideologues have gone even further in pledging to turn India 
into a 'Dharmic' (religious) superpower. The Vishva Hindu Parishad 
mobilizing the Hindus on the basis of religion all over the world, 
the RSS successfully militarizing the Hindus and secretly vowing to 
undo the division of mother India, Prime Minister Vajpayee's 
commitment to the nuclear option, the appointment of Saxena, the 
former RAW chief, as the governor of occupied Kashmir and the new 
BJP president Thakre threatening to bring Pakistan to its knees, 
all these signify the gathering of the storm before the outbreak of 
armed hostilities.
    
Seen in this perspective, even if Pakistan dismantles all its 
defences and settles all its disputes on terms of India and also 
develops trade relations, this, far from ushering in an era of 
peace and friendship, would only fuel the fire of India's hegemonic 
ambitions and military chauvinism and would pose even greater 
threat to the security and integrity, not only of Pakistan, but all 
other weaker neighbours.
    
But in the midst of the rising crescendo of national rejoicings on 
the successful test-firing of Ghauri, Mr M.B. Naqvi chose to 
severely criticise the missile enthusiasts (Dawn April 29):
    
The writer perhaps himself would have joined the nation in its 
rejoicings if he could see through India's mounting anti-Pakistan 
military chauvinism, now evident from the five nuclear tests 
carried out this week.
    
Mr Naqvi's argument that, after all, we have tried arms race, cold 
war and military confrontation for 50 years, making our problems 
only more intractable is based on the wrong hypothesis that it was 
Pakistan, and not India, which opted for the arms race, cold war 
and military confrontation. It was India which took the Kashmir 
dispute to the Security Council and pledged to implement its 
resolutions but it went back on its solemn pledge and declared 
Kashmir to be its integral part ultimately giving rise to an 
uprising in the occupied territory. The BJP leadership is 
threatening to annex Azad Kashmir. The other day a number of highly 
trained terrorists from India infiltrated into Azad Kashmir and 
killed 22 innocent Kashmiris.
    
Again in violation of the Indus Basin agreement India has built 
dams over rivers Chenab and Jhelum. India, besides committing 
aggression against Pakistan thrice on one pretext or another, has 
been amassing troops on the Pakistani borders. Not long ago India 
mobilized its army on Rajasthan-Sindh border on the pretext of army 
exercise "Brasstack" as a camouflage to attack Sindh. Earlier Mrs 
Indira Gandhi had made all the preparations to attack Pakistan but 
the American intelligence got the wind of it and the sinister move 
was thus frustrated.
    
India first exploded its nuclear device in 1974 which sent Pakistan 
scurrying seeking the protection of the nuclear powers but no such 
protection was promised. Pakistan also sought an assurance from the 
India that its nuclear device will not be used against Pakistan but 
no such assurance was forthcoming.
    
Pakistan was thus left with no alternative but to seek its own 
nuclear capability.
    
Similarly it was India which secretly developed its missile system 
and then publicly carried out test firing of the Prithvi and Agni 
missiles despite protests from Pakistan. Now, it has carried out 
more nuclear tests.
    
It is, therefore evident that the fifty years of cold war, arms 
race and military confrontation were initiated and precipitated by 
India and Pakistan only responded to it. Therefore, the question of 
Pakistan signing the NPT and CTBT unilaterally, simply does not 
arise.

<a name="punj">Punjab gears up to hold National Games in Lahore</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

LAHORE, May 13: XXVIII National Games will  be organised at Lahore 
in the year 2000 in a befitting manner. For that purpose, necessary 
infra-structure will be built and all amenities would be provided.
    
Punjab Chief Minister's advisor on sports Akhtar Rasool Chaudhary, 
during a ceremony arranged at the National Hockey Stadium (NHS) on 
Wednesday to give awards to Punjab sportsmen and sportswomen who 
won medals during the National Games at Peshawar, held out a firm 
assurance on behalf of the Chief Minister. He also requested the 
Federal Government to make generous grant for the XXVIII National 
Games. He requested the advisor on sports to Federal Sports 
Ministry, Ali Muhammad Khawaja (also present on the occasion), to 
do his bit for that purpose.
    
"The Punjab players should not rest on the laurels gained at 
Peshawar but should strive harder to achieve greater honours for 
the province and the country", said the Bombay World Hockey Cup-
winning Pakistan team captain Akhtar Rasool.
    
Akhtar reminded that there was always room for improvement. "When, 
I was declared the best player of the World Cup, my father, the 
Olympian Ghulam Rasool Chaudhary had pointed out seven mistakes 
committed by me during the tournament", Akhtar Rasool told the 
Punjab players, who in his opinion should now aim at winning top 
honours during the next National Games.
     
Punjab Olympic Association (POA) president and former provincial 
chief secretary Javed Ahmad Qureshi urged  the government to build 
indoor gymnasia and outdoor stadia in Lahore of international 
standard so that not only the XXVIII National Games be organised 
efficiently but international and regional competitions could also 
be organised in this 'haven of sports'.
     
The association secretary Ali Muhammad Khawaja said that a 
committee was being formed which would meet Chief Minister Shahbaz 
Sharif and ask him to dole out funds for building a tartan track in 
Lahore and improving other facilities.
     
Deputy chef-de-mission of the Punjab contingent in XXVII National 
Games at Peshawar, Idrees Haider Khawaja congratulated his wards 
for gaining better performance this time than the one exhibited 
during the XXVI National Games at Karachi in 1997.
     
Every player who won an individual gold medal got a cash award of 
Rs 5000. Silver medal winner was given Rs 3000  and bronze medalist 
was awarded Rs 2000. Members of every team which won gold medals 
got Rs 3000, each.
