Pakistan being made invincible, says Nawaz
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
LAHORE, April 12: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed his resolve 
to make Pakistan an invincible and prosperous country where 
problems of the people could be solved immediately. 
    
He said he knew that the people had pinned high hopes on his 
government and he was trying to come up to their expectations.
    
Speaking to the people gathered at his Model Town residence here on 
Sunday, Mr Sharif said he wanted to strengthen the national defence 
so that the enemy could not harbour evil designs against the 
country. Likewise, he said, he wanted to make Pakistan an 
economically prosperous state where the people faced no problems. 
He said he was aware of the problems of the people and held out an 
assurance that those would be solved soon.
    
Many people apprised the prime minister of their problems and he 
issued instructions for their solution.
    
Some people insisted that Mr Sharif should make an announcement for 
the construction of the 3,600 megawatt Kalabagh dam. They 
maintained that the prime minister would go down in the history as 
a courageous ruler and a benefactor of the nation if he approved 
the Kalabagh project brushing aside resistance from different 
quarters.
    
The prime minister, however, did not oblige them saying that the 
supporters of the project should also take into account his 
constraints. He said he knew that he would be praised if he 
announced the launching of the project, but added that being a 
prime minister of the country he could not take any decision 
without much consideration.

Referring to the civic problems of big cities, the prime minister 
said that the government was contemplating engaging international 
firms to maintain cleanliness, water supply and drainage system. He 
hoped that a qualitative change would be witnessed if the 
experiment succeeded.
    
The prime minister said that Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) had 
failed to perform its duties. The reason, he said, was paucity of 
resources and equipment to deal with the problems of the unplanned 
growth of the city. In his opinion there was a dire need to 
maintain a check on the unplanned growth of cities.
    
Referring to the Khidmat (service) committees scheduled to be sworn 
in across the country on Monday afternoon, the prime minister said 
they would help solve the problems of the people. He said although 
the establishment of the committees had earlier been delayed 
because of reservations expressed by various people, those would 
render valuable services.
    
Mr Sharif took exception to complaints that medico-legal reports 
were not being provided on time. He directed all concerned to 
remove procedural bottlenecks so that the aggrieved parties could 
get justice immediately.
    
The prime minister said he would also take up the matter with the 
Punjab chief minister, chief secretary and the inspector-general of 
police.
    
The prime minister promised to provide a yellow cab to a jobless.

Khidmat committees to get full powers: PM
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent
    
SUKKUR, April 15: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared here on 
Wednesday that his government aimed at rebuilding and restoring 
public confidence in national institutions, and towards that end a 
crusade would be launched to eliminate illiteracy, obscenity and 
corruption.
    
He was speaking at an open kutchery in connection with land 
distribution among landless peasants in the Shah Mohammad Mazari 
village of Kashmore.
    
The prime minister said the nation had been kept illiterate for 
fifty years, but his government was trying to provide education to 
children of the under-privileged people and to give them job and 
other opportunities available to the privileged classes.
    
He said he would like to see happiness and hope in the eyes of 
these poor (the landless peasants) people, because they had 
remained bareheaded and barefooted for centuries although the land 
belonged to them.
    
He said he would ensure that the jobless educated youth were 
allotted lands, especially the agriculture graduates, and his 
government would give them soft loans for tubewells and tractors.
    
The prime minister claimed that during his first term dacoities and 
kidnappings had been banished. That was why, he said, the people of 
Sindh had voted in large numbers for his party in the last 
elections. 
   
He predicted that with his present package of reforms his party 
would capture the remaining seats in the province in the next 
elections.
    
Mr Sharif said Khidmat committees had been launched to eliminate 
corruption and he would fully protect them in their crusade against 
evils. He said he would also launch a campaign against dowry, 
because it, too, was a curse.
    
He also referred to the new education policy which, he said, would 
make each and every child in the country enable to get education in 
primary schools.
    
The prime minister also ordered an enquiry by the Khidmat committee 
of Kandh Kot against the SHO of Tangwani on an allegation by a 
teacher, Noor Mohammad Bijarani, of excesses and accepting graft 
from him of Rs 7,000. He called both the complainant and the SHO on 
to the stage and asked them to state their versions.
    
The teacher accused the SHO of pressuring him for graft for 
releasing him when (the teacher) was on census duty. The SHO denied 
this and said the teacher was wanted in a karo-kari case.
    
The PM asked the Khidmat committee to hold an inquiry and give him 
a report in seven days.

Final round of PML-MQM talks today
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent
   
LONDON, April 17: Talks between Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and 
Pakistan Muslim League (PML) are moving in a positive direction and 
will arrive at a positive conclusion on Saturday, leaders of the 
two sides said here after Friday's meeting.
    
"Things are moving towards an understanding and we hope matters 
will be resolved," MQM chief Altaf Hussain told reporters after the 
three-hour-long talks held at the Muttahida's International 
Secretariat in Edgware, north-west London.
    
The PML leaders, Chaudhry Nisar and Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat 
Jatoi, also sounded optimistic about the outcome and hoped that the 
talks would end on a positive note.
    
The next session of the second round will be held on Saturday at 
11.30am.
    
He was the first to comment on the negotiations as he emerged from 
the venue along with PML leaders.
    
Federal minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali, who is leading the government 
side, told reporters that another session would be held on Saturday 
and hopefully it would yield "some result".
    
"Another session will be held tomorrow and I am confident that we 
will arrive at some positive conclusion."
    
Chaudhry Nisar said during Friday talks, the two sides discussed a 
large number of issues, including the Muttahida's demand to get the 
"no-go areas" vacated.
    
He said more discussion on the issue would be held during the 
Saturday session.
    
The minister said MQM chief Altaf Hussain gave an overview of the 
MQM-PML relationship. "It was an overall review of PML-MQM 
relationship of the last 10 years," he said. The government side, 
he added, placed before him PML's viewpoint on certain issues.
    
"There was a complete consensus between the two sides that joint 
efforts to preserve the political and democratic process in the 
country should continue."
    
Referring to differences between the two parties, Chaudhry Nisar 
said such misgivings and misunderstandings did occur between 
alliances but asserted that these should be removed in a "political 
manner."
    
"The general tone and tenor (during the talks) was positive and 
friendly and reflected 10 years of relationship between the two 
parties," he said.
    
"You should see the expression on our faces to know about the 
atmosphere inside," a beaming minister said.
    
ALTAF: Mutahhida Qaumi Movement chief Altaf Hussain said on Friday 
that the MQM was entering into talks with the government with an 
open mind but the result would depend on the intentions of the two 
sides.
    
"Both sides are present here and they are here to resolve the 
problems and I would say it all depends on the intentions of both 
the sides," the MQM chief told reporters before entering into talks 
with the two-member PML team comprising federal minister for 
provincial coordination, Chaudhry Nisar Ali and Sindh chief 
minister Liaquat Jatoi.
    
Mr Altaf said the two sides were here with good intentions to 
resolve the issue and that the Mutahhida was in favour of a 
solution.
    
"We want to arrive at some conclusion, which will be beneficial for 
both of us as well as for democracy and the country," he 
emphasised.
 
He said the meeting would discuss the main agenda i.e. the vacation 
of the no-go areas in Karachi from its rival Haqqiqi group.
    
Chaudhry Nisar Ali said his party was here with high hopes. He said 
PML's alliance with Mutahhida was decade-old and had seen many ups 
and downs.
    
"Invariably we have come out of difficult times and we are hopeful 
that even this time we will come out," he said.
    
The talks started at 5.00pm London time (9.00pm Pakistan time).
    
Mr Altaf Hussain is leading his team at the talks which includes 
Senator Aftab Sheikh, Ms Nasreen Jaleel, Qazi Khalid, Dr Farooq 
Sattar and Federal Health Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and 
Sindh Labour Minister Shoaib Bokhari.
    
The first round of talks between Chaudhry Nisar Ali and Altaf 
Hussain on Wednesday did not yield any result and it was decided to 
hold second round of talks to be attended by Sindh chief minister 
Liaquat Jatoi and members of the MQM coordination committee.
    
The MM meeting ended at 8.00am on Friday morning.

$1m paid for documents on Bhuttos' accounts
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent
    
LONDON, April 12: Pakistani politicians, apparently belonging to 
the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, had paid $1 million ( around Rs 
45 million) to an un-named source in return for the documents which 
allegedly establish opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and her 
husband Asif Ali Zardari's involvement in corruption, The Sunday 
Times claimed in a full-page article today.
    
Published on the front page of the News Review section of the 
newspaper and titled as "The Hunt for Benazir's Booty", the article 
does not mention the name of the politicians who paid such a huge 
amount for the documents and whether the money was paid from the 
government coffers or from their own pockets. Nor does it clarify 
where did such huge amount come from.
    
Written by Rajeev Siyal, a journalist of Indian-origin working for  
The Sunday Times and Stephen Grey, the article, quoting its 
sources, said that Ms Bhutto's political downfall was "sealed in 
1995 in a hotel room overlooking Hyde Park in London."
    
" Dressed in shalwar-kamiz. senior agents of the Pakistan Muslim 
League, the opposition party, sat around a table, drinking glasses 
of mineral water with a team of private investigators," the article 
claimed.
    
"An explosive offer was being discussed. A mysterious source wanted 
$10 million for a few photo-copied pieces of paper. The source was 
not prepared to show the documents in advance but he claimed they 
were items from the office of Jens Schlegelmilch, a Geneva lawyer 
and the Bhutto family's agent in Europe. They proved, he claimed, 
that Benazir and her family had secretly been amassing a fortune in 
Swiss bank accounts by taking corrupt commissions on government 
contracts," the article said.
    
"At first the Pakistanis were suspicious. The source refused to 
show the documents in advance and there was no way of proving their 
authenticity. 'There was a lot of negotiation but the man was not 
prepared to bargain properly. He could not come to a deal 
initially, even if it all appeared exciting,' said one person 
invovled," the article said, quoting an un-named PML source.
    
"Rebuffed, the source disappeared without a deal being concluded," 
the article said and quoted its source as saying: "He disappeared 
off the face of the earth even though we were desperate to find him 
again, until, out of the blue, he phoned up. This time we could do 
business."
    
The article said that after the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto's 
government in 1996, the un-named source again contacted the PML 
leadership to make the deal in return for the documents.
    
"On cue, the missing Bhutto mole made contact. Sources say $1 
million was handed over in return for the documents. For Benazir's 
enemies, this Swiss dossier was cheap at the price," the article 
said.
    
But it did not mention which PML leader paid the money and several 
questions remain unanswered. Questions like whether it was paid 
from his own pocket or from the government coffers? If paid from 
own pocket, from where did he get this money and whether it was 
tax-paid money or black money?
    
The paper has mentioned some of the documents of the dossier and 
they are apparently those which Ehtesab Bureau Chairman Saifur 
Rehman carries in his briefcase all the time to show and deliver it 
to any journalist willing to publish them.

Lanka to buy gunboat from Pakistan,says paper
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranjitha Balasubramanyam
   
COLOMBO, April 11: The Sri Lankan navy proposes to buy a gunboat 
from Pakistan which fires missiles, a privately-owned daily, The 
Island, revealed recently.
    
"The Sri Lanka navy is seriously considering buying a missile 
gunboat from Pakistan which will cost the taxpayer a stupendous one 
million dollars each time a missile is fired," the newspaper said 
quoting unidentified defence sources.
    
The report said a high-powered team of navy officers, which 
recently returned from Pakistan after inspecting the vessel, had 
submitted a report recommending the purchase of the missile 
gunboat, which itself would cost $15 million.
    
The team of officials visited Pakistan following the visit of the 
navy commander, Admiral Cecil Tissera, who had suggested to the 
government that Pakistan had several warships that could be 
inspected by the navy before vessels could be procured to upgrade 
its fleet, the report said.
    
The newspaper said the million-dollar missiles used by the armoury 
of the Pakistani gunboat carried very small warheads and had far 
less destructive power than the ordinary artillery shells fired by 
the army. "The only advantage these missiles will have over 
artillery shells is that they will have a sophisticated guidance 
system which could zero in on a precise target. However, since the 
missiles have a range of nearly a hundred kilometres, they will 
need to be guided by a sophisticated equipment on board an 
aircraft. Such an aircraft would cost in the range of another 
twelve million dollars," the report said.
    
The newspaper claimed that the navy did not need such a vessel as 
the air force was capable of bombarding enemy targets on shore. 
"The air force already has bomb targeting systems on board their 
Israel-built Kfir jet bombers, which are just as good," the report 
said.
    
The report said the navy had invited tenders for a warship with 
heavy guns, which closed on March 24. Bids were received from 
Ukraine, Pakistan, Russia, United States, Israel, Australia, 
Holland and Singapore. 
    
"However, the Pakistani bid does not contain a 76mm gun as the 
tender clearly specifies, and has the missile system instead. Thus, 
it is surely going to be rejected," the report inferred.
    
It charged that the navy appeared to be pushing ahead with plans to 
purchase the warship although it had floated a tender. The 
Pakistanis, the report said, had been outclassed by warships of 
eight other nations who had also sent in bids. "The Pakistanis sent 
in a bid, which everyone sees does not fit the bill, and yet the 
navy may purchase this ship outside the tender itself," the 
newspaper claimed.
    
The president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, had cancelled the Russian 
arms deal in 1994, when she took over as the prime minister. She 
had termed the transaction a "crooked deal" and ordered the defence 
ministry to revoke it.

US seeks to diversify ties with Pakistan
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar 
    
ISLAMABAD, April 16: The visiting US special envoy Bill Richardson 
said on Thursday that Washington had moved away from the "single-
item agenda" in the context of Pakistan-US relationship and was 
seeking to build new linkages in diverse fields, with particular 
emphasis on trade, commerce and investment.
    
The US ambassador to the UN said this during extensive talks with 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and other officials in the morning 
which covered all aspects of bilateral, global and regional 
concern, including Kashmir, Afghanistan and the issue of F-16 
planes.
    
Mr Richardson assured the prime minister that the main focus of 
President Clinton's visit would be to consolidate friendly 
relationship between the two countries.
    
Referring to the unresolved issue of F-16 planes, Mr Richardson 
admitted that it had been an irritant in an otherwise excellent 
relationship. He said President Clinton had conceded that it was 
unfair on the part of the United States to have kept the planes as 
well as the money paid by Pakistan for the aircraft and was keen to 
resolve the issue to the satisfaction of Pakistan, an official 
source said.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, in response, expressed confidence that 
President Clinton's visit to the region this year would help 
promote peace and stability in South Asia. He hoped that India 
would be persuaded to resume talks on Kashmir and other contentious 
issues and end atrocities in Kashmir.
    
The prime minister informed Mr Richardson about the regional 
situation and the test-firing of Ghauri missile. He said that the 
development of the missile was for defence purpose and to serve as 
a deterrent.
    
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad 
and Pakistan's Ambassador to Washington Riaz Khokar assisted the 
prime minister in talks with the American delegation. Besides Mr 
Richardson, three senior US officials  Assistant Secretary 
Inderfurth, Director of the National Security Council Bruce Riedel 
and US Ambassador to Pakistan Thomas Simons were present during the 
talks.
    
Mr Richardson conveyed to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif US President 
Bill Clinton's warm greetings and said he had been sent as a 
special envoy to undertake necessary groundwork in preparation for 
the upcoming visit of President Clinton.
    
Later, Bill Richardson and his delegation held formal talks at the 
Foreign Office which covered all major regional issues. Foreign 
Minister Gohar Ayub, who led Pakistan side at the talks, reiterated 
Pakistan's willingness to resume talks with India at the earliest 
on the basis of the Islamabad agreement of June 23, 1997, which 
envisaged setting up of separate working groups for discussion on 
Kashmir and security, besides other issues.
    
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub while referring to Pakistan's 
initiative for peace in Afghanistan told the US delegation that the 
settlement of Afghan issue was possible only if the Afghan groups 
hold talks.
    
AFGHAN TALKS: The situation in Afghanistan was also discussed in 
detail with the US team. Ambassador Richardson expressed deep 
appreciation for the major initiatives taken by the prime minister 
to promote a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict in that 
war-torn country.
    
He reiterated that the United States wished to promote a serious 
dialogue among the many factions in Afghanistan and recognized that 
Pakistan had to play a major role in this process.
    
The United States has proposed to the Afghan factions to initiate 
negotiations on April 27, Afghan sources said in Islamabad on 
Thursday.

WHO declares war on polio, maternal death
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, April 15: The menace of polio will be eradicated and the 
maternal mortality rate will be reduced by at least 50 per cent in 
Pakistan by the year 2000. All efforts will, however, be made to 
bring down the maternal mortality rate to the minimum.
    
This was stated in a message of Dr Hussein Gezairy, regional 
director of World Health Organization, at the world children's 
health conference on Wednesday on "Safe motherhood" a subject 
chosen for this year's World Health Day. The conference was 
organized by Hamdard Public School.
    
The WHO representative said after the eradication of small pox from 
the face of the earth and the elimination of guinea-worm disease 
from many countries, including Pakistan, the WHO's next target was 
eradication of polio and a drastic cut in maternal mortality by the 
year 2000.
    
He said nearly half of the world's women had no one to attend to 
them during labour pain to provide help if things went wrong. Over 
half a million mothers died during child-birth each year, he said, 
adding that in addition to that 50 million more women suffered from 
maternal morbidities as a result of pregnancy- related 
complications while 80 per cent suffered long-term morbidities.
    
Dr Gezairy said almost 90 per cent of these deaths occurred in Asia 
and Sub-Saharan Africa, 10 per cent in other developing regions, 
less than 1 per cent in the developed world, and 25 to 33 per cent 
of such deaths of women of reproductive age resulted from 
complications related to pregnancy or child-birth.
    
Giving more statistics, he said at least 35 per cent of women in 
developing countries still received no ante-natal care, almost 50 
per cent gave birth without a skilled attendant and 70 per cent 
received no post-partum care. In contrast, maternal healthcare is 
nearly universal in the developed world.
    
Dr Gezairy said maternal mortality in the developing world was 18 
times higher than in the developed part of the world. Similarly, 
infant mortality was almost seven times higher in the developing 
regions than in the developed world, he added.
    
In Pakistan, the WHO representative said, the situation was very 
serious as only 19 per cent of women had access to skilled birth 
attendant and only 26 per cent women received pre-natal care.
    
Child-birth and pregnancy-related complications accounted for 
25,000 to 30,000 deaths in Pakistan every year, Dr Gezairy said, 
adding that those who suffered morbidities and disabilities were 
four to five times higher in number and most of these deaths could 
be prevented by bringing about improvement in the reproductive 
health services in a decentralized manner.
    
He said these maternal mortality ratios reflected women's risk of 
dying each time she became pregnant because women in developing 
countries bore many children and obstetric care was poor. Their 
lifetime risk of dying is 40 times higher than in the developed 
world. A combination of factors, including poverty, ignorance, lack 
of healthcare facilities, poor nutrition, unsafe drinking water and 
poor sanitation, also contributed to the high maternal mortality, 
he added.
    
He said the WHO had called for a package of interventions and 
measures aimed at improving the health status of mothers and the 
new-born children. These measures also include birth spacing, 
promotion of family planning practices and breast-feeding.
    
"Problems of maternal mortality can also be tackled through the 
provision of an integrated health and social care to women, from 
childhood through adolescence and womanhood. In countries of our 
region, including Pakistan, which is a Muslim region, such issues 
should not be a problem," the WHO representative added.
    
He said Islam accords a special and most respectful status to women 
whether they are mothers, daughters, sisters or wives.
    
Those who spoke at the conference included Hamdard Foundation 
president Hakim Said.

Power pacts not to be cancelled: seminar told
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter
    
KARACHI, April 14: The government will not cancel agreements with 
the Independent Power Projects (IPPs) and instead strive for an 
amicable settlement with them on the issue of tariff revision, said 
the Minister for Water and Power Raja Nadir Pervaiz on Tuesday.
    
"The impression that we are going to cancel the agreements is not 
correct," said the minister while inaugurating the two-day seminar 
on energy organized jointly by ABN Amro and Financial Post and made 
it clear that "negotiations with the IPPs will continue and we are 
not going to take any unilateral decisions, it has to be across the 
table and will be a package deal."
    
Emphasizing the need for a negotiated settlement the minister said 
that if the two sides failed to convince each other then there 
would be parting of ways but hoped that "situation will not arise."
    
He said WAPDA was paying Rs 6 billion every month to the IPPs which 
should be rescheduled. Its payment, he said, should not be front-
loaded and bracketing of the project should be advanced by two 
three years.
    
The minister said the private power projects could not do it on 
their own. They have to discuss it with other lenders of credit, 
besides the World Bank and the IFC.
    
He however, emphasised that relief on interest by lenders to the 
IPPs should be passed on to WAPDA and its consumers.
    
The minister said that WAPDA had a surplus of 2000mw and was 
looking for markets in and outside the country. However, that would 
depend on the government decision.
    
"We are trying to convince the IPPs to extend the implementation of 
their projects till year 2002 to enable WAPDA to find new consumers 
for surplus power", said Raja Nadir Pervez.
    
Replying a question the minister said the government was looking at 
various options which included adjustment of fuel price.
    
He said government was also reviewing proposals to convert furnace-
oil-based projects into gas or coal-based projects to reduce the 
input costs.
    
Chairing the first session of the seminar the minister disclosed 
that government was also considering concessions in power tariff 
for industrial consumers and special structures for sick units as 
part of their revival plan. "The flat rates for tubewells will now 
be offered for only 10 hours", he added.
    
Faridullah Khan, Joint Secretary Ministry of Water and Power spelt 
out salient features of the new power policy which would be based 
on competitive bidding and the government would invite bids for 
specific requirements.
    
Earlier, Managing Director of the KESC, Kamal Afsar said the public 
sector power utilities have proposed to the government to waive 
development surcharges on fuels so that input costs incurred in 
generation and transmission can be brought down.

Call to explore Pakistan, India trade potential
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
LAHORE, April 14: There exists a lot of potential for trade between 
India and Pakistan which must be explored for the benefit of their 
people.
    
'Let's talk trade. Let's leave the controversial and political 
issues to governments to resolve. Trade will bring about a lot of 
change (in the bilateral relations),' Automotive Component 
Manufacturers Association of India president K. Mahesh told 
businessmen at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 
here on Tuesday.
    
Mahesh is leading a 20-member delegation of Indian businessmen 
involved in automotive components manufacturing. He said the Indian 
automotive component manufacturers were prepared to share their 
experience with their Pakistani counterparts and transfer 
technology to them to help them improve their production.
    
He said the businessmen should form groups to lobby with their 
respective governments to promote trade because nobody would come 
to help them if they did not start working together. 'This is the 
only solution to our problems.'
    
He was of the view that SAARC should be activated on the lines of 
ASEAN, NAFTA and European Union. 'Trade will open the doors for the 
resolution of problems between the two countries,' he assured the 
businessmen.
    
He said the multilateral agencies like IMF and World Bank and WTO 
were not working for Pakistan or India. 'They serve the interests 
of the richer nations. There solutions for the poorer countries 
have never worked. It is for us to help each other if we wish our 
people to prosper and develop.'
    
Mahesh said liberalization and opening of 'bilateral trade was in 
the interest of both the countries'. 'It'll give you access to 
cheaper raw materials and other goods. Besides, it will also give 
you a cheaper land route to approach Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for 
marketing of your products.'
    
He sought to dispel the impression that the 'Indian industries 
enjoyed government subsidies'. 'It is not true. The government is 
giving subsidies to farmers alone by providing cheaper fertilizer 
to them. We don't want any subsidies.'
    
Replying to a question by journalists, Mahesh said the members of 
his delegation did not expect any concrete business deals from 
their present visit. 'We have come to explore the potential which 
exists if the business community of the two countries decides to 
work together. It will also help the businessmen of the two sides 
to understand tariff regime of the other country.'
    
He eschewed questions relating to the political troubles like the 
Kashmir issue, saying: 'Political issues must be left to the 
governments to settle. We must talk trade which can bring about a 
lot of change (in bilateral relations).'
    
He sought to dispel the impression that Indian goods would swarm 
the Pakistani markets once the free trade was allowed. 'It is not 
true. I'll be surprised if any Indian company floods its products 
in Pakistan.'

Plan to boost software export
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter
    
KARACHI, April 16: A Rs273 million information technology plan has 
been designed to boost software export through the development of 
software professionals and experts by recognizing the possibility 
that foreign exchange earnings from software exports have the 
potential of solving the budget deficit.
    
The information technology initiative, which is claimed to be the 
brainchild of Sindh Governor Moinuddin Haider, covers areas such as 
development of curriculum for universities to prepare graduates for 
software export market requirement, introduction of short courses 
to train a large number of professionals who can exploit 
opportunities offered by the millennium bug, and increase in 
resources to upgrade the computer departments.
    
The areas also include setting up a high speed computer network of 
universities, sharing of experienced faculty and computing 
resources, Internet and e-mail facilities at universities, and 
supporting of computer institutes through affiliation.
    
Speaking at a briefing for newsmen at the conclusion of a meeting 
of vice chancellors and computer experts at the Governor's House on 
Thursday, the governor said the plan had been put into operation 
after almost six months of groundwork during which various 
specialized committees submitted their findings.
    
The governor said he had held several meetings with the vice 
chancellors of universities in Sindh and the heads of their 
respective computer departments to develop a plan for improving 
computer education and monitor its execution.
    
The first meeting was held on August 27, 1997, at the Institute of 
Business Administration. The meeting finalized an information 
technology plan which was put into execution immediately.
    
The governor said there were plans to create a computer culture in 
schools, colleges and universities in the province to exploit the 
potential.

Trade gap narrows to $1.36bn in 9 months
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, April 11: Pakistan's foreign trade gap narrowed further 
to about $1.36 billion during the first nine months of the current 
financial year, says a Federal Bureau of Statistics statement.
    
This is about $42 million more than the gap registered during July-
February (1997-98). A decline of 2.53% in exports for March 1998 
signifies a slowing down of the process. Silver line is that 
imports had a dramatic drop of 31.9% in dollars.
    
According to the statistics, the exports during July-March (1997-
98) totalled $6.417 billion  4.7 per cent more than during the 
corresponding of last year, while the imports dropped 11.11 per 
cent to $8.749 billion. The trade gap in July-March (1996-97) was 
$2.62 billion, i.e. about $1 billion more than in the corresponding 
of 1997-98. This raises the possibility that the country would 
realise the projection of $2.33 billion for trade gap by next June. 
However, one has to sit with fingers crossed to see whether it can 
achieve the target of $9.575 billion for exports for the current 
year. For in the remaining three months, Pakistan would need to 
export at the average monthly rate of $0.797 billion in order to 
come at par with the target, in contrast to the performance during 
July-March  $0.713 billion per month. This compares favourably 
with last year when the corresponding period had registered a 
monthly average of $0.681 million. The group "Primary Commodities" 
constituted 14.59% of total imports during the 9-month period as 
against 12.43% for the corresponding period of last year. But then 
this is the only group which showed positive growth.
    
Textile manufactures: This group, which had teetered on the brink 
for the past couple of months, dropped its exports by 0.92% on the 
cumulative performance for the nine-month period. In March, 
however, it plunged 15.93% as compared to the same month of 1997. 
Its exports during July-March totalled $4.060 billion, thus 
reducing its contribution to 63.27% of the total exports for July-
March (1997-98), down from 66.86% for July-March (1996-97). During 
March, exports of this group totalled $0.422 billion.
    
The data show a quantitative increase of 37% in import of soyabean 
oil (101,348 tons) and palm oil (778,002 tons). But in dollar 
terms, the import bill for these oils increased by 84%. In rupee 
terms, the increase was more than double. Costing $0.554 billion, 
these items accounted for 35.42% of total food import bill.
    
Overall, the import of machinery group declined by 25.2%, although 
it continues to constitute the highest import bill  $1.803 billion 
or 23.19% for July-March (1997-98). The items in this group which 
registered negative trend were power generating machines, 
electrical machinery, aircraft, ship & boats, and agricultural 
machinery. This may mean that the market  is saturated with these 
items. However, substantial increases of 51.8% and 50.2% were 
registered in respect of imports of office machines  including data 
processing equipment, and textile machinery.
    
The country imported over 3.0 million tons of petroleum crude 
during  July-March  (1997-98), 4.2% more than  during the 
corresponding period of last year. But in dollar terms, the import 
bill on account of this item declined by 19.5% and in rupee terms 
by 11.42%, thanks to drop in its world prices.
    
Another significant aspect of the imports is that the import of 
rubber tyres & tubes increased by 11.68% during the period. 
Connected with this is the decrease of 17.9% in import of rubber 
crude. In other words, the local production in tyres & tubes is 
declining under pressure of imports.

Money market in liquidity crisis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim
    
KARACHI, April 16: A severe liquidity crunch in the short term 
money market has pushed call rates up to 18 per cent and forced the 
banking system to borrow overnight funds from the State Bank.
    
On Thursday call rates oscillated between 17.95 and 18 per cent and 
the inter-bank market saw a discounting of more than Rs 4 billion. 
This amount of discounting was less than half the average 
discounting during the last two weeks as an inflow of Rs 5.1 
billion had partly eased off the borrowing pressure. The inflow was 
due to maturity of short term federal bonds sold at a previous open 
market operation. On Wednesday a discounting of Rs 10 billion had 
taken place.
    
Short term money market normally remains tight at the end of every 
quarter of the fiscal year because of outflows from the system on 
account of debt payment and settlement of import bills etc. 
    
The close of the first quarter of the current fiscal year also had 
its impact on the market but this time two other factors also 
siphoned off excess liquidity from the market.
    
"The crisis started early this month with the remittance of $170 
million by Hubco," said treasury manager of a foreign bank. This 
prompted many leading exporters to sell dollars in ready market as 
the price of the greenback had reached the highest point in the 
official exchange rate band of Rs 44.05Rs 44.49. "As a result 
banks spent most of their ready funds for buying the dollars which 
rendered them short of rupees," the banker explained.

Proposals given to PM: Economists want tax base widened
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque
    
ISLAMABAD, April 17: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a high-
level meeting here on Friday, which reviewed the prevailing 
economic situation in detail and called for taking early measures 
to achieve the economic stabilization and restructuring programme 
in the country.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the meeting, which was attended by 
four federal ministers, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission, three 
ministers of state and number of top independent economic experts, 
have stressed the need for removing existing bottlenecks in the 
system.  Ministers of finance and commerce and Deputy Chairman 
Planning Commission Dr Hafeez Pasha gave the overview of the 
economy and expressed their satisfaction over it by saying that 
things have improved a lot compared to the last year when the 
government took over.
    
However, sources said the private experts who included former 
minister for finance Dr Mahbubul Haq and a New York-based Senior 
Executive of the Citibank, Shaukat Aziz did not believe that enough 
has been done to achieve economic stabilization.
    
They said that more efforts were required to broaden the tax base, 
impose effective agricultural tax system and to check growing 
corruption in Pakistan.
    
Sources said that Dr Mahbul Haq particularly talked about the 
documentation of the economy in the absence of which, he did not 
believe the government could get desired results.
    
Sources said the participants heard the point of view of former 
minister for finance with great interest. But the prime minister 
was more enthusiastic about the views of Dr Haq and agreed with him 
that without having the full documentation of the economy, nothing 
could be achieved.
    
Dr Haq said that low revenues were the biggest problem which needed 
careful attention of the government. He said social sectors were 
not being provided adequate annual allocations with the result 
there was no real growth in education, while health and other 
sectors were also suffering.
    
At this stage, Chairman Central Board of Revenue (CBR) Moeenudin 
Khan told the participants that work on the documentation of the 
economy has started and that the issue was a part of the 
restructuring plan of the organization. He then referred to CBR's 
plan to appoint private investigating agencies to help locate 
hidden assets and tax evaders.
    
Sources said that Khan also told the meeting that he would achieve 
positively the revised annual revenue target of Rs 305 billion at 
the end of the current financial year. Sources said that Senior 
Executive of the Citibank Shaukat Aziz when invited to give his 
view, called for achieving early economic stabilization and the 
restructuring programme. 
     
He also said that real efforts should be made to discourage 
corruption. He was of the view that the banking system should also 
be improved and that the private sector should be encouraged by 
providing it a required loaning.

Sale of govt land to encourage small units
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque
    
ISLAMABAD, April 15: The Privatization Commission has decided to 
hire land management consultants and land evaluators to sell the 
government's property worth over Rs 30 billion.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Wednesday that the Privatization 
Commission has worked out a detailed plan to auction government's 
land by developing plots for small industrial units.
    
The purpose, they said, was to help undertake small scale 
industrialization process throughout the country. In this regard a 
decision has been taken to have a comprehensive land policy to 
auction government's property. And the job, sources said, will be 
accomplished by hiring land management consultants and land 
evaluators.
    
The PC has also proposed the development of a vendor industry and 
auto market by auctioning government land specially in bigger 
cities. The idea was to offer plots, measuring about 600 yards or 
one kanal to small businessmen to help establish their industries 
with a view to encourage grassroots industrialization. And as a 
first a step, 250 kanal land of Pakistan Engineering Company (PECO) 
at Badami Bagh, Lahore will be sold. Sources said that this land 
has the value of about Rs 600 million.
    
Similarly, a decision has been taken to later auction another PECO 
unit at Kot Lakhput, Lahore which has 93 acres of land and could 
fetch about Rs1 billion. The entire machinery of PECO at Badami 
Bagh has been shifted to PECO Kot lakhpat in order to sell the land 
as early as possible.
    
Sources said that the PC would soon advertise for hiring Chartered 
Surveyors along with land management consultants and land 
evaluators. Initially it planned to higher about 20 such experts. 
"Since the industrial sector is now left with leftovers which may 
not give a good price to PC, decision has been taken to auction 
huge land of the Pakistan Railways, Sindh Engineering, and other 
public sector corporations", said an official. "We need a fiscal 
space to encourage the setting of small and medium scale industries 
in Pakistan", he said adding that emphasis will also be laid to 
develop cottage industry through the sale of the government's land.
    
Sources said that the PC was now to privatize 30 industrial units 
which include loss making and slightly profit making enterprises, 
beside bigger entities like Pakistan Telecommunication Company 
Limited (PTCL), Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC), 
Sui Southern and Sui Northern, duty free shops etc. A few 
Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) and Development Financial 
Institutions (DFIs) were also to be privatized.
    
However, sources said that the deadline for privatizing banks and 
DFIs and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) by June this year was not 
likely to be met.

Tea prices fall by Rs25-30 per kg
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aamir Shafaat Khan

KARACHI, April 17: The wholesale prices of imported tea (loose) 
have declined by Rs 25-30 per kg in the markets following the 
reduction of 20 per cent import duty i.e. from 45 to 25 per cent in 
the second week of March.
    
An importer in the Jodia Bazar said that an imported tea, which was 
selling at wholesale price of Rs 260-270 per kg in the first week 
of March, is now available for Rs 240-245 per kg.
    
The tea of average quality now carries a wholesale price of Rs 205-
210 per kg compared to Rs 230-235 per kg.
    
The retail side is yet to see any decline in the market but 
wholesalers say that it will take at least a week to pass on the 
benefit of price cut.
    
An importer said the cost of import has now reduced by 27 per cent 
as the cumulative taxes and duties come to 52 per cent of total C&F 
value after the reduction in import duty compared to 79 per cent 
when the duty was 45 per cent.
    
Similarly, the average landed cost, he added, is now estimated at 
$2.50-2.85 per kg compared to March first week's price of $3.30-
3.50 per kg depending on the brand.
    
However, the much expected price fall from the tea packers 
including a multinational is yet to be seen. A leading packer said 
that the company is engaged in working out the actual impact which 
is to be passed on to the consumers.
    
He anticipated a price cut of Rs 2-4 on a 250gm packet in future 
which would not represent a 20 per cent duty reduction.

Southern Region collects Rs17.50bn income tax
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana
    
KARACHI, April 13: The Southern Region of Income Tax, Karachi has 
managed to collect Rs 17.50 billion or 61 per cent of the revised 
target of Rs 27 billion during first three quarters (July to March) 
of the current fiscal year.
    
According to official figures made available on Monday, the 
Southern Region has made higher collection in all categories of 
direct taxes except import-related taxes which stood short by Rs 
508 million or 7 per cent less than that of a corresponding period 
of last year.
    
"Presently our concern is over poor collection of import-related 
taxes, on which the department has no control, as their collection 
is directly linked to the volume of imports which has registered a 
substantial decline during this period," said an official of the 
region.
    
"We are doing well in other areas of direct taxes and are sure to 
achieve the targets, and if any setback comes it would only be due 
to lesser collection of taxes on imports," he further explained. 
Historically, he said that tax collection during last quarter 
accounts 40 per cent of the entire target.
    
Revenue collection on account of import-related taxes constitutes 
45 per cent of the total collection of the Southern Region. 
Consequently, even a small percentage fall in collection in this 
account makes a lot of difference for the region.
    
Tax collection on imports during July-March stood at Rs 7.405 
billion or 7 per cent lesser than that of last year when the 
collection was Rs 7.913 billion.
    
Giving other details the official said that up to March 31, the 
region collected Rs 16.4 billion on account of income tax as 
against Rs 15.8 billion during the same period of the last year.

State Bank relaxes Prudential Regulations
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim
    
KARACHI, April 13: The State Bank of Pakistan has extended by one 
year up to 30th June, 1999 the deadline set for the borrowers to 
match their current assets and current liabilities for seeking bank 
loans. On Friday, the SBP had reduced from 25 to 20 per cent the 
bank provisioning against sub-standard loans i.e. the loans whose 
principal or mark-up/interest has been overdue by 180 days or more.
    
The deadline has been extended through an amendment in one of the 
prudential regulations  regulation no 5. This and some other 
changes and additions in the prudential regulations are contained 
in a SBP circular issued on April 11.
    
The circular says banks would ensure that the current assets and 
current liabilities ratio of the borrower is 0.9:1.0 up to 30th 
June 1998, and 1:1 from 30th June 1999. Earlier the borrowers were 
supposed to maintain these ratios from 30th June, 1997 and 30th 
June, 1998 respectively. 
    
The circular does not say what ratio the borrower would maintain 
between 1st July, 1998 and 29th June, 1999 but a SBP spokesman told 
Dawn 0.9:1.0 would be the minimum required ratio during this 
period.
    
The circular retains the debt equity ratio intact at 60:40 for 
issuing fresh long-term debts "provided the differential between 
required and existing ratio is made good during the extended period 
i.e. upto 30th June, 1999." In other words no bank would issue 
long-term debt with 60:40 debt equity ratio unless the borrower 
either reduces debt or increases equity to make the bring the 
present debt equity ratio to 60:40 level.
    
Previously the borrowers were supposed to inject during each year 
1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 "an amount equal to one third of the 
difference between the required equity and existing equity." This 
means that the borrowers have been given one-year extension in the 
deadline set for them to correct their present debt equity level to 
make it 60:40.
    
Other rules mentioned in prudential regulation no 5 remain 
unchanged.
    
The circular also gives one year more to the borrowers to inject 
additional equity to qualify for seeking fresh or additional credit 
beyond their borrowing limit of 10 times of the capital and 
reserves. "Total accommodation availed by a borrower from 
banks/financial institutions may exceed 10 times of the capital and 
reserves (free of losses) of the borrower provided the borrower 
injects additional liquidity in the extended period," says an 
amendment in prudential regulation no. 4. It says the facility may 
be availed of till 30th June, 1999.
    
Previously the borrowers were supposed to inject during each year 
(1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98) an amount equal to one third of the 
difference between the equity prescribed by this regulation and the 
existing equity.
    
Senior bankers reached by Dawn said the one-year extension in the 
deadline set for the borrowers for maintaining a matching debt 
equity ratio is aimed at creating more avenues for lending by the 
banks. They said an equal extension granted for correction in the 
debt equity ratio of the borrowers is also aimed at facilitating 
the banks to offer more credit. The twin measures would boost 
private sector lending and enable the banks to offer help in 
revival of sick industries.
    
The circular has also amended prudential regulation no 2 to exclude 
certain obligations of the banks from their contingent liabilities. 
The circular says obligations under letters of credit and letters 
of guarantee to the extent of cash margin retained by a bank would 
not fall in its contingent liabilities. It further says that 
letters of credit or guarantee issued on behalf of the federal or 
provincial government established through the State Bank of 
Pakistan would also not constitute contingent liabilities of the 
bank provided payment against the said letters are guaranteed.

Use of natural gas stressed in new policy
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, April 15: In view of the mounting oil import bill the 
government has formulated a new fuel strategy under which emphasis 
would be more on the use of natural gas resources as compared to 
oil. 
    
The new fuel strategy would focus on building new hydel projects on 
priority basis besides taking measures for optimum use of Thar coal 
reserve, increasing use of natural gas, accelerate search for oil 
and gas besides extracting optimum capacity of the existing 
resources. 
   
This was stated by Federal Petroleum Secretary Dr Gulfraz Ahmed at 
the concluding session of the two-day energy seminar organized by 
ABN AMRO Bank and Financial Post on Wednesday. 
     
He emphasized that profitability of oil companies would not be 
affected by the new policy. While dealing with Pakistan's oil and 
gas requirements he said that 38 per cent of the country's fuel 
requirements could be met from natural gas. 
     
He said the government would speed up exploration of natural gas 
because the oil import bill, which had crossed $2.5 billion during 
1996-97, had become a major burden on the country's resources. 
     
He stated that during 1996-97 Pakistan imported about 6 million 
tons of oil out of which 45.5 per cent was used for transport 
sector and 32.1 per cent was consumed by the power sector. The 
traditional source was not sustainable, he added. 
     
Dr Gulfraz said gas was not only a cheaper source of energy but 
also environment friendly and in the next century there would be a 
phenomenal increase in tapped gas reserves in the region. 
     
He said the government was also working out a strategy of 
encouraging new power projects to shift from oil to natural gas. 
   
"Natural gas has indicated a five per cent growth rate annually and 
we don't see any reason why this trend will not continue," he said 
adding there would be major gas discoveries within the next two to 
three years. 
      
He said the country would also benefit from import of natural gas 
from the Central Asian countries through pipeline stretching upto 
2000 km. 
      
Pakistan, he said, would sign an agreement with Shell at Islamabad 
on Thursday for exploration of oil and gas in the Indus delta area. 
     
He stated that the agreement would be in accordance with the 
Petroleum Policy of 1997 which aimed at increasing indigenous 
energy reserves.

IPPs ready to reduce tariff conditionally 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul  Haque
    
THE INDEPENDENT Power Producers (IPPs) have offered a "solution and 
a way out" to their growing differences with the government over 
the issue of electricity tariffs by proposing that they should be 
allowed to export power to India.
    
The IPPs are believed to have informed the government that they are 
also ready to reduce their tariffs from 6.5 cent per unit to 4.5 
cents which was more than 30 per cent, provided they are permitted 
to directly import fuel oil for their power plants in Pakistan.
    
There have been a number of secret meetings between government 
officials and the representatives of the IPPs during the last few 
days but without any result.
    
The IPPs in the first place reportedly refused to lower their 
tariffs and said it would adversely effect future foreign 
investment in Pakistan, in case agreements were cancelled.
    
In this behalf they repeatedly referred to the recently concluded 
visit of the high officials of the US Overseas Private Insurance 
Corporation (OPIC), US Import and Export Bank (Ex-Im), and the 
American Development Agency, which reportedly point blank told the 
government officials that it was unacceptable for them to revise 
power tariffs by having any modification in the Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs).

Two options
    
However, insiders say that the representatives of the IPPs have 
offered two options: (a) allowing them to export power to India and 
(b) permitting them direct import of fuel oil.
    
With the IPPs demand to allow them to export power to India, a 
debate is said to have started within the government, with some 
senior officials favouring the idea. They said when IPPs export 
power to India, nobody would raise any objection as to why was 
being done specially when India had not resolved the Kashmir 
dispute.
    
"I think it is a viable solution which could save both the 
government and the IPPs," said a source who believed that 
electricity being generated by the IPPs should be exported to India 
which will provide funds to the government in the shape of duties 
and will eventually help run WAPDA efficiently.
    
However, the government seems reluctant to allow the IPPs to 
directly import fuel oil for their plants.
    
The issue of what the government usually terms "high and 
unjustified power tariffs has been debated many times in the ruling 
PML party and in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's kitchen cabinet 
where most of the members favoured cancelling of agreements with 
the IPPs to save WAPDA. But Minister for Finance Senator Sartaj 
Aziz and Minister for Water and Power Raja Nadir Pervaiz have 
reportedly called for adopting a cautious approach and opposed 
unilateral cancellation of agreements.
    
However, they avoided to say any thing in public unlike Minister 
for Health Javed Hashmi who said the other day that the government 
has decided to scrap agreements with the IPPs.
    
His statement invited a sharp reaction among the donor community 
after which Mr Sartaj Aziz had to say that there was no such 
proposal in the offing. Nevertheless, he said that action against 
some of the IPPs was likely to be taken for having their plants 
commissioned without following certain procedure and that they had 
committed gross irregularities.
    
The finance minister also does not rule out the possibility of 
invoking US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act against at least two of 
the IPPs for not adhering to the procedure and got their plants 
commissioned by offering commission and kickbacks.
    
Insiders said that the immediate reason for the government to 
become too jittery was when it had to pay off $170 million to IPPs 
on account of selling their power to WAPDA.

Second tranche
    
The IMF had just disbursed the second tranche of $180 million, out 
of $1.6 billion ESAF-EFF and extended Fund agreements. And as soon 
as this money reached the State bank, the next day the government 
had to make this payment to the IPPs.

Stocks end with clipped gains, decline resisted
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter
    
KARACHI, April 17: Stocks on Friday reacted modestly as weakness of 
pivotals spilled over to other counters but larger decline was 
resisted thanks to strong support at the dips by some foreign 
investors.
    
The decline was largely led by market leaders, notably PSO, PTCL, 
Hub-Power and ICI Pakistan, which came in for active profit-selling 
at higher levels.
    
But most of the price changes were extremely fractional and 
reflected weekend selling rather than massive liquidation from any 
of the leading brokerage houses.
    
The broader market, however, performed relatively weak as the 
leading index shares finished with clipped gains, pushing the KSE 
100-share index below the psychological barrier of 1,600 points.
    
It was last quoted at 1,595.13 points as compared to 1,603.16 on 
Wednesday, reflecting the relative weakness of PTCL apparently on 
stray foreign selling.
    
The market capitalization also suffered a contraction of Rs 2.553 
billion at Rs 439.120 billion as compared to Rs 441.353 billion on 
Wednesday as highly capitalized shares showed fall.
    
Although the current tariff row is heading towards its logical 
conclusion as foreign sponsors of power units have put forward 
their own conditions to cut rates, investors decided to take 
profits in pivotals among them apparently to buy them at the lower 
levels next week, dealers said.
    
"The market could witness a renewed buying euphoria next week on 
prediction of a massive inflow of foreign buying under the lead of 
US investors," analysts said.
    
They based their assessment on the recent US official 
pronouncements hinting at increased investment and new trade 
relations "beyond the single-agenda perceptions."
    
"The US investors might not come that way, the market has its own 
reasons to behave orderly after the current diffusion of tension 
between the ruling elite," they added.
    
Shell Pakistan led the list of gainers, up Rs 14.00 at Rs 308.00 on 
heavy buying after the news that its management has been granted 
concession for off-shore oil drilling along the coastal areas. 
Engro Chemicals followed it, rising by Rs 5.00 to Rs 76.30.
    
Lever Brothers came in for renewed selling and was marked further 
down by Rs 7.50 at Rs 1,597.00 and so did Escort Bank, falling by 
Rs 8.35. PSO, Mohib Textiles, Southern Electric and Reckitt and 
Colman also showed modest decline ranging from Rs 1.05 to Rs 1.10.
    
On the other hand Paramount Modaraba, Fidelity Bank, East-West 
Insurance, Sapphire Textiles, Star Textiles and some others came in 
for active support, rising by one rupee to Rs 1.50.
    
Volume figure showed a modest expansion at 52 million shares as 
compared to previous 47 million shares. Out of the 162 actives, 71 
shares fell, 48 rose with 43 holding on to the last levels.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTCL, off 35 paisa at Rs 
31.45 on 28 million shares, followed by ICI Pakistan, easy 50 paisa 
at Rs 17.65 on 12 million shares, Hub-Power, lower 40 paisa at Rs 
46.20 on 8.270 million shares, FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, down 20 paisa 
at Rs 17.80 on 1.069 million shares, and MCB, up 90 paisa at Rs 
34.25 on 0.566 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Southern Electric, off Rs 
1.10 on 0.449 million shares, followed by Reliance Insurance, 
unchanged on 0.200 million shares, Sui Southern, easy five paisa on 
0.156 million shares, and Searle Pakistan, lower five paisa on 
0.149 million shares.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Three shares, Schon Spinning, Al-Qadir 
Textiles and Sunshine Cloth came in for trading and accounted for 
2,500 shares including 1,500 shares in Sunshine Cloth.

Storming of the Supreme Court-3    
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee
    
SOON after receiving a notice from the Supreme Court summoning me 
up to Islamabad to appear on March 25, where my statement in 
connection with the November 28 storming of the Court was to be 
recorded, one of our senior most journalists rang to say that what 
he could not tell me on the telephone he wished to come, pronto, 
tell me in person.
    
He came and whispered that an Intelligence Bureau man had enquired 
about my antecedents and those of my General Staff Officer-1 (G-1), 
my fellow-columnist by avocation. The IB had been ordered to 
compile files. Nothing new, I told my worried friend, they have 
been preparing files on me since 1948, and my telephone remains 
tapped. A new man has apparently fallen upon an old job.
    
This was filed away as a circumstance.
    
In the early hours of March 22, a man broke into my house, came 
into my bedroom, and when I sleepily asked who he was and what was 
happening, with hand held over his mouth, he ordered me to go back 
to sleep. Switching on my beside light, I asked why, having awaken 
me, he now wished me to sleep. He put off the light, hand still 
over mouth, hoarsely whispered "Paisa, paisa." I had none, I said, 
but he could take whatever pleased him, and depart. Patting his 
midriff, he threatened, "Goli marega, goli marega." Go ahead, I 
told him. An inquisitive man, he wanted to know how I eat without 
money.My money is with my major-domo who feeds me. He could go 
downstairs, and rob him if he could. He then pulled out my 
telephone wire.
    
He rifled around the room, opening cupboards and drawers. Intrigued 
by my hat boxes in one cupboard, he wanted to know what they 
contained? My ceremonial Parsi pugrees, I told him. Take them. In 
another cupboard were my panama hats. How many hats do you wear, he 
asked? He fondled the CD player, the VCR, the receiver. He 
inspected my camera, put it back. Fiddling about on my dressing 
table, he picked up my gold signet ring and my watch, padded about 
a bit, and then left.
    
Not a usual occurrence, but not that unusual in this city devoid of 
law and order. The man was a junkie, I concluded, wanting money for 
a quick fix. On second thoughts, he was far too clean for the 
normal junkie, too well dressed, in a 'khadar' shalwar-kamiz. The 
incident was filed away as a happenstance.
    
Whilst in Islamabad, I narrated this happening to my retired 
friend, Khan Roedad Khan, the longest-serving interior secretary of 
our country who glorified that office for nine years running. 
Secure in his knowledge and giving me a severe look, he told me not 
to take the matter lightly, it was an 'agency' intimidation ploy. 
How 'unlightly' do I take it, I asked? Shall I double my guard and 
oil my revolver?
    
Back in Karachi, after the March 25 hearing, due once again in the 
Supreme Court on April 2, when a further lot of 'stormers' were to 
give their statements, I prepared a second affidavit attaching 
additional press cuttings in which names of the MNAs, the MPAs and 
the PML stalwarts were mentioned as having been present at the 
Court on November 28, and in which were printed photographs of 
certain prominent 'stormers.' We worked on this on the evening of 
March 31, prior to flying off to Islamabad on April Fool's Day.
    
Finishing late, my General Staff Officer 1 (G-1) left for her home 
at around 2330. Going up the Shahrah-i-Iran towards the sea, just 
short of the British High Commission, one takes a right turn to 
enter the gate of the block of flats in which she lives. Halting at 
the intersection, the lanes leading down to the Do Talwar 
roundabout were clear. On taking the turn, to slightly double back 
and drive into the gateway, came an almighty explosion, jostling 
the creeping car to a halt just short of the driveway.
    
The left side of the car was in smithereens, shattered glass all 
over the place. My G-1 got out of the car, leaving the engine 
running, to find out just what had happened. A motor bike was lying 
on its side in the middle of the road, with a man getting to his 
feet. He walked over to the kerb and sat down. Before she could ask 
him what the hell he was doing riding without a light and banging 
her broadside, a hefty man strode out of the darkness, switched off 
the car ignition and pocketed the key. In the meanwhile, the 
apparent unhurt kerb-sitter lifted his shirt to rub his midriff. 
Around it he wore a belt and a gun holster.
    
She requested the 'hefty' to kindly give her back her car keys so 
that she could get the car off the road and into her compound. He 
waved a plastic card at her, would not let her hold it to see 
exactly what it was, said he was the law, lifted his shirt and 
pointed to the gun holster he too wore. There was no reaction to 
her complaint that the motor bike had no lights. He then walked 
over to the man on the kerb and spoke to him.
    
After a few minutes, when the normal crowd had gathered, all 
passing traffic having stopped to see the 'tamasha', the motor- 
biker decided to lie down on the road and do a bit a moaning and 
groaning. The 'heavy' used his mobile phone and called a police 
mobile which duly arrived. My G-1's further requests for her car 
key were refused, the 'heavy' handed it over to a uniformed 
mobileman, mounted the mobile with the motorbike rider, informing 
all present that he was taking him to hospital. Whilst all this was 
happening, a few of G-1's neighbours arrived to help. One, a friend 
of the former DC of District South (to our sorrow recently 
transferred), raised him on his mobile phone. The cop was ordered 
to relinquish the car key.
    
Not once was my G-1 asked her name, where she lived, or what had 
happened. No lawmen present asked for her car papers, or driving 
licence, or expressed the slightest interest in the event. No 
questions, no hint of investigation. The motor-bike too was taken 
away. The whole matter ended there, in the middle of the road in 
the middle of the night. No queries, no follow-up, nothing. This 
also was filed away as a coincidence, one of three within the space 
of three weeks.
    
Now to less frivolous matters. The contempt of court cases 
initiated by former Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah against Nawaz 
Sharif and his apostles, Benazir Bhutto, columnists, authors, 
publishers et. al., have been decided. To no one's surprise, all 
have been let off. Three contemners, MNAs Khawaja Asif, Hamza 
(ruling party), and Asfandyar Wali Khan (ANP) were found guilty but 
not punished. The opposition politicians must be rejoicing. These 
three they can have disqualified by filing references before the 
Election Commissioner.
    
Nawaz Sharif's lawyer, S.M. Zafar, has boasted that the 500- page 
judgment (which needs to be seriously analysed) is monumental, 
historic. Would Law Minister Khalid Anwar please assure the people 
that S.M. Zafar and others, who defended the legislators, have not 
been paid, directly or indirectly, from the national exchequer.
    
Now, the most serious matter. The next hearing of the inquiry into 
the storming of the Supreme Court by members of the ruling partly 
is fixed for April 23. The Attorney-General and his officers tutor 
the PML legislators and others summoned to testify before the 
Court. Why? To his credit it may be said that at the hearing on 
April 2, the Deputy Attorney-General was honest enough to admit 
that summoning other PML members would produce no fruitful results 
as they would all tell the same story  they are law-abiding 
citizens who hold the judiciary in the greatest esteem, they were 
present in the Court on November 28 solely with the intent to 
persuade the court-stormers to cease their dancing and chanting, to 
leave the premises and uphold the sanctity of the honourable Court, 
so on and so forth.
    
Lastly, to the man who relieved me of my watch and ring. The ring 
has gone, melted down by now, no doubt. Many years ago in England a 
burglar cleaned out the flat of King George V's jockey, Gordon 
Richards. Richards wrote to the press, telling the burglar that he 
can keep all the rest of his booty but would he consider returning 
the gold cigarette case presented to him by the King, which bore 
the engraving "George V, R.I." as it had great sentimental value. 
The burglar obliged. Now, please, will my forty-year-old Vacheron 
Constantin, specially made for me with loving care, shaped and 
sized to fit my wrist. I will compensate him.

Another day, another circus                                          
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain
    
LIKE a magician pulling out yet another rabbit from his hat, Nawaz 
Sharif has produced his Khidmat Committees to the roll of drums and 
the fanfare of trumpets.
    
But while we see the show and the shadow, we can discern no 
substance. The difference between our prime minister and a stage 
magician is that the latter only has to fool his audience for a 
brief moment with his quick hands and glib tongue, while the PM is 
trying to do so for the duration of his entire tenure. Well into 
his second year of office, the artifice is wearing thin, and the 
calls are getting louder. How long before the brickbats and the 
rotten tomatoes?
    
Soon after he started enjoying wielding power, Zia declared that 
henceforth, Pakistan would be "the laboratory of Islam". In the 
same breath, he announced the imposition of Zakat, and the 
establishment of zakat committees. These are still around despite 
allegations of massive corruption, and the compulsory deduction of 
this religious tax leads to withdrawal of billions from accounts 
just before Ramazan every year. Tens of thousands have also 
declared that they belong to Fiqh Jafria to escape this tax which 
is above and beyond other secular taxes.
    
Since Zia's days, elected leaders have seen fit to impose a number 
of weird schemes on us: there was the People's Works Programme, the 
Nai Roshni Project, and the Yellow Cab Scheme, to name only a few. 
We are still living with the biggest boondoggle of them all: the 
siphoning off of development funds by our representatives for the 
so-called "development" of their constituencies. These hare-brained 
programmes have cost the exchequer billions; indeed, future 
generations will be paying for them for years to come.
    
It would seem that our leaders are incapable of analysing our 
problems, and then putting in the hard, sustained and focussed work 
that the country needs. We don't need a genius to tell us that the 
two crucial issues facing Pakistan today are population and 
education. We must curb the former and increase the latter if we 
are to survive and thrive; and if we don't, we will continue going 
down the chute as we are today.
    
Unfortunately, neither area makes headlines, nor affords our 
shallow politicians with photo opportunities. As a consequence, 
both remain relegated to the back burner while all our meagre 
resources are squandered on deserted motorways, F-16s that aren't 
delivered, missiles and unwanted airports. Oh yes, we mustn't 
forget all the written-off and unrecoverable loans  Rs 140 billion 
and counting  that our politicians and their sidekicks have 
siphoned off from nationalized banks, DFIs and cooperatives.
    
An idea of this government's attitude to the population problem can 
be gauged by the fact that the 2010 document supposedly a 
reflection of the Muslim League's vision for the future of the 
country (if it can be accused of having such a thing), contains no 
mention of it. And in his address to the joint session of 
Parliament the President made no reference to it either. So 
clearly, Nawaz Sharif isn't overly concerned that Pakistan has one 
of the highest population growth rates in the world, and we now 
number over 140 million, as against 35 million 50 years ago.
    
And as for education, we have the disastrous new education policy 
before us in all its glory. Condemned by educationists and 
newspapers across the country for its vacuity and lack of coherence 
and vision, this is the best the ruling party could come up with, 
despite the presence of perfectly workable documents that had been 
prepared in the past.
    
Or perhaps this focus on fanfare and hoopla is an admission of 
failure by a leadership that realizes that it has no answers in the 
problems that face us today. And thus, we have the Ghauri and the 
Elite Force to divert us from the magnitude of the bankruptcy we 
face in every sphere of activity today.
    
In my more pessimistic moments, I fear we will never get a serious 
sensible government that just gets on with the job at hand, rather 
than wasting its time and our money on frivolous and futile 
exercises. Take the Elite Force as the latest example: We already 
have a plethora of police, security and paramilitary forces 
functioning in the country, usually ineffectively.
    
How will the creation of this new group make any difference? We 
have been told by the IG of Punjab Police that among other 
facilities being created for this force, a swimming pool will soon 
be built for them. Now I would never begrudge the Elite Force this 
luxury, specially as so many terrorists swim to our shores. Next, I 
suppose we will have to construct a ski lift for them.
    
Almost simultaneously, the khidmat committees have been established 
to function as a sort of parallel government. My experience has 
been that the more agencies you create, the rate of corruption 
increases, while the speed at which papers move decreases. And what 
happens if and when local bodies elections are held? I can see 
endless conflicts between the elected councillors and the unelected 
committee members. And in between these battles for turf and power, 
the lower level bureaucracy will be squeezed for more graft.
    
It is this addle-pated reflex to find a quick fix in order to avoid 
solid hard work that has led to so many of our problems. The fact 
of the matter is that the laws are there, and the machinery is 
there to enforce these laws. What is lacking is the political will 
to implement laws and rules across the board and without fear or 
favour: If certain political parties harbour terrorists among their 
ranks, it is unlikely that the Elite Force will move against them 
if they are in alliance with the government of the day. Similarly, 
if our leaders refuse to stop at red lights, the police will start 
turning a blind eye to other infractions; it is pointless to create 
yet another police force to enforce rules that are not imposed 
uniformly.
    
The next time I go to a magic show, I plan to take some rotten 
tomatoes along.

Implications of the missile test
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lt Gen (retd) Talat Masood
    
THE government's announcement about the successful launching of the 
medium range missile, Ghauri, was too sketchy to comprehend its 
full impact. Furthermore, with memories still afresh about the 
claims regarding the total indigenization of the 'Khalid' the main 
battle tank and the publicity surrounding it, one would prefer to 
proceed with caution rather than be overtaken by euphoria.
    
Nevertheless, from what has been reported about the test it appears 
to be a big leap in Pakistan's efforts at building its indigenous 
defence capability, for which the team of engineers and scientists 
led by Dr A.Q. Khan, deserves to be congratulated.
    
The proto-type development of Ghauri is Pakistan's response to 
India's fast developing missile programme. It is an indication of 
the government's firm resolve to keep in mind its genuine security 
needs and not be outdone by the growing menace of India's missile 
race. Pakistan's missile test, irrespective of the fact whether it 
was of the entire or partial systems, underscores the fact that 
with requisite political will, national resources can be mobilized 
to safeguard the security interests. Current international 
environment also compels Pakistan to rely mostly on its own 
resources for its security, rather than seek vague assurances from 
major powers.
    
In all probability the birth of this medium range missile will 
remain shrouded in secrecy and its precise capabilities may never 
be made public owing to its security classification. It would be 
years, if at all before the nation would know of its development 
history. Not unexpectedly, the Indians and a few in the US have 
falsely accused China of transferring its technology for this 
project. Nonetheless, one thing is abundantly clear that the tight 
restrictions of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) would 
have prevented Pakistan from receiving any form of systematic 
foreign assistance.
    
This stands in sharp contrast to the easy access provided to India 
during the initial build-up of its missile and space programme. 
India received substantial assistance to develop the relevant 
capabilities from the former Soviet Union, the US and France under 
the cover of civilian space programmes. Israel has a very active 
programme of missile development and their current Arrow project, 
which is an advanced anti-tactical ballistic missile, is being 
developed with American money and technology.
    
Ghauri missile is a significant technological achievement because 
at ranges beyond 1000 kms technical complexities begin to multiply 
exponentially. At long ranges guidance technology requires greater 
precision and rigorous performance specifications have to be 
maintained to cater to the re-entry problems. Medium and long range 
missiles with large pay-loads (500 kgs and above) also require high 
thrust engines, whether solid propellants or liquid-fuelled, which 
are not easy to develop. It is possible that we may have taken 
another route to avoid the more sophisticated one by clustering 
several Hatf engines.
    
In any case, whatever technical solution was adopted for the 
propulsion of the missile, it seems to have performed well. The 
credit also goes to our engineers and scientists for resolving the 
related complex problem of systems integration. Above all, the 
designing, development, and the organizational and managerial 
expertise associated with the fabrication of a complex weapon 
system like Ghauri is no mean achievement when viewed in the 
context of Pakistan's weak industrial and technological 
infrastructure.
    
The test of the Ghauri missile has some lessons for the world so 
far as Pakistan's quest for technology is concerned. The forward 
march of technology is an irresistible process which no country can 
impede by enacting any form of legislation. The spread of 
technology has a dynamics of its own. No country, however strong 
can devise an effective barrier to the spread of scientific and 
technical knowledge, which refuses to recognize the national 
boundaries.
    
The MTCR in its present form is not designed to protect the 
legitimate security interests of Pakistan or for that matter, of 
the developing world. At best what the MTCR and other similar 
treaties can do is to retard the process of technology transfer. 
But at the same time they encourage countries which are living in 
the shadow of hegemonic powers to develop capabilities to thwart 
aggression.
    
The spread of technological capabilities is inevitable. With the 
passage of time more and more countries will acquire the capability 
of doing what is currently the monopoly of a few. In fact, 
Pakistan, in spite of its limited technical infrastructure and 
economic constraints, has invariably benefited in its efforts 
towards self-reliance when it was faced with arms embargoes.
    
When the developed countries continue to rely on the missiles as a 
component of security, it looks strange on their part to preach 
restraint to others. It is important that the US and the other 
major military powers undertake deep cuts and move towards a 
missile non-proliferation regime to slow down the spread of 
missiles in the crisis-ridden areas of the world. The development 
of missiles by Pakistan, apart from countering India's threat are 
also a substitute, albeit a less effective one, for advanced strike 
aircraft. Most combat aircraft are capable of achieving greater 
range and accuracy and carry significantly larger amounts and more 
diversified types of weapons. The denial of F-16s to Pakistan by 
the US and the exorbitant costs of the French Mirages may have been 
another major motivating factor in the development of the missiles.
    
For Pakistan, the development of missiles has a profound political 
impact both at home and abroad. Pakistan's missile programme 
represents its efforts to counter India's hegemonic ambitions and 
at the same time promote technological know-how in the Muslim 
world.
    
The medium range missiles have to be highly accurate in order to be 
effective with a conventional warhead. In the absence of any 
official information, it can only be surmised that the drift rate 
of Ghauri is less than 0.1 per cent. A missile system armed with a 
conventional warhead should have an accuracy matching the lethal 
radius of its warhead.
    
The cost of the missile is another critical factor which should 
determine whether a missile is suitable in a conventional or 
nuclear role. For instance, it would hardly make sense to lob 
conventional warheads as far as 1500 kms if they cost around, say 
Rs 50 million a piece. The same logic will be equally applicable in 
respect of the intermediate range Indian missile, Agni. Estimates 
by analysts indicate Agni's price to be around eighty to a hundred 
million rupees a piece. One could argue that militarily and cost-
wise intermediate range missiles are justified only if these are 
armed with nuclear warheads, notwithstanding that developing these 
is a major undertaking and may take several years owing to 
miniaturization and associated technical problems.
    
Before starting their ambitious integrated missile programme in 
1983 the Indian leadership should have realized that they were 
sowing the seeds of a dangerous arms race in the region. If 
unchecked, the potential of both countries to create significant 
mutual damage will only get worse. As India and Pakistan expand 
their missile and nuclear arsenals, it will become more difficult 
for them to delink national security from ballistic missiles.
    
It seems as if the clod war with renewed zeal has begun all over 
again in this region, or conversely one could argue that it had 
never ended, in the first place. India views its comprehensive 
nuclear and missile programmes central to its global aspirations 
and military modernization. Pakistan tries to keep up with its 
adversary in this race and stands ready to match India's nuclear 
and missile related activities.
    
However, most unfortunate is the fact that both are pursuing 
policies which are unrelated to their current priorities which 
should have been fighting poverty, illiteracy and lawlessness and 
turning their economies around. After all, was there any meaningful 
military need for India to proceed with the development and forward 
deployment of the Prithvi missiles? It is really sad that the case 
for Prithvi was being advanced by the Indian hawks at a time when 
the prospects for peace were emerging on the horizon. Was India 
justified in making preparations last year to conduct a nuclear 
explosion in the Rajasthan desert? Similarly, does it serve 
Pakistan's interests to engage in an arms race? North Korea has 
perhaps the most capable missiles in the Third World but it is on 
the brink of falling apart. These are serious questions and need 
well thought out answers.
    
It is time for the leaders of India and Pakistan to reflect as to 
whether they want to continue on the dangerous path of a nuclear 
and missile race or move towards reconciliation and resolution of 
their disputes in a peaceful manner. Both countries must resume the 
stalled dialogue seriously and address the underlying tensions. 
Concurrently, they must also work out a regional agreement that 
verifiably controls advance weapons which they hold in their 
inventories and have the potential to manufacture.

British Open Squash: Jansher's defeat an ominous pointer
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan
    
Pakistan's unprecedented 16-years-old domination in the prestigious 
British Open Squash finally ended on April 5 at Birmingham 
(England) when Jansher Khan, defending the title for the seventh 
successive year despite knee problem, was comprehensively beaten by 
Peter Nicol, the first Scotsman ever to win the trophy since the 
championship was instituted 68 years ago in 1930.
    
Left-handed Peter Nicol, the runner-up to the Khan in the 1997 
British Open final  a five-game battle that lasted for two hours 
26 minutes  took only 50 minutes for an imposing 17-16, 15-4, 15-5 
victory over an unfit Jansher Khan. He is suffering from a torn 
ligament in his left knee since the Super Series event in February 
this year.
    
Born in Peshawar on June 15, 1969, the Khan had ousted 25-year old 
Peter Nicol in the 42-minute semi final of the eight -man super 
series in straight games but at the end of the series he developed 
trouble in both his knees. An orthopaedic surgeon of Birmingham had 
advised him to get his left knee operated while his right knee 
needed exercise.
    
Disregarding this medical advice Jansher competed in the British 
Open as skipping the first super series of the 1998 event would 
have brought his present world number two ranking lower. Jansher's 
entering the final was itself surprising as both world number three 
Jonathan Power and world number five. Ahmed Barda were beaten. The 
title holder was as such up against Australia's world number ten 
Den Johnson and had to struggle hard for a 3-1 victory lasting one 
hour and eight minutes, before reaching the final for the 8th time.
    
Peter Nicol fulfilled his ambition to be crowned as ow champion of 
the British Open after dislodging Jansher Khan from world number 
one ranking three months back. Pakistan's pride Jansher Khan had 
remained on top of the world ranking for four and a half years but 
his bad patch had started last year when he suffered four defeats 
against Peter Nicol.
    
The second super series - AL-Ahram International  is scheduled 
from May 21 at Cairo and holder Peter Nicol is certain to defend 
the title, the first major title he won last year by defeating the 
then defending champion and top seed Jansher Khan by 31.

It is not yet known if Jansher Khan would be undergoing knee 
operation before the Al-Ahram International or after the end of the 
tournament as he has yet to make it public. His failure against 
superfit Peter Nicol indicates that the Khan might prefer to get 
his knee operated after which were need at least one month's 
complete rest for full recovery. The mystery surrounding the 
operation issue of Khan must be unravelled to remove the anxiety of 
his well-wishers in Pakistan.
    
According to the PSA, the 1998 tour calender resumes in August. The 
second part of the super series included six events  Pakistan 
Open, Hong Kong Open. Kuwait open, Egyptian Open Qatar 
International and World Open.
    
Great concern is being expressed at the emergence of Peter Nicol 
and a host of other strong challengers from England and Australia. 
Doubts had been expressed about Pakistan's abilities to dominate 
the international squash following the decline of the legendary 
Jahangir Khan (holder of ten successive British Open titles. 
Similar fears are being aired at Jansher Khan's repeated failures, 
his eight world open triumphs notwithstanding. At the moment we 
find no potential players in Pakistan to the emerging challenge.

Dutch coach starts training of probables
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, April 15: In a surprising move, the Pakistan Hockey 
Federation (PHF) has acquired the services of a Dutch penalty-
corner drill specialist Toon Siepman who reached here on Monday 
night to train the Pakistan senior team which is defending its 
title in the World Cup to be held at Utrecht (Netherlands) in May 
this year.
    
Toon Siepman watched the Pakistani players in action in the evening 
session of the training camp which is in progress at the National 
Hockey Stadium since April 10.
    
Talking to journalists, Toon Siepman who is the coach of Holland's 
A Grade hockey and has trained the Dutch penalty-corner specialist 
Bram Lomans said that he would only give training to the players in 
the offensive department of the penalty-corner and not in 
defensive.
    
To a question, Siepman said that he was hired for three weeks. "The 
time is short and a challenging task is ahead, but I can do lot of 
work", he said.
    
The lanky Dutch coach said that he would impart training of 
penalty-corner conversion in both sessions of the camp.
    
Siepman said that he would concentrate on all full-backs of the 
training camp and not only on Sohail Abbas, an up-and-coming 
penalty-corner specialist of Pakistan.
    
However, Sohail Abbas is with the Pakistan Whites team which is in 
Kenya after winning four nation tournament in South Africa this 
week. Besides Sohail Abbas, 11 players of the whites team are among 
the probables of the Pakistan senior camp. 
   
The team is arriving on April 16 (Friday). Sohail Abbas and others 
are not able to join the camp before April 18. The PHF secretary 
Col Mudassar Asghar while commenting on hiring Toon Siepman said 
that it was a part of PHF preparation programme of the team for the 
World Cup. 
He hoped that the Dutch coach would remove the shortcomings of the 
team in the penalty-corner drill.
     
Except for Hyder Husain, who is not well, the remaining 22 
probables attended both the morning and afternoon sessions of the 
camp which resumed on Tuesday after a day's rest.
