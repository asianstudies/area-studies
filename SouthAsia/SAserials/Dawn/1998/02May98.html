<a name="f16d">F-16 deal seen before Clinton's visit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 28: United States and Pakistan are negotiating a 
package deal to resolve the F-16 issue before President Clinton's 
Islamabad visit and top Congressional leaders have expressed 
support for some of the proposals.
    
Details of the various ideas and options that are being discussed 
were obtained by Dawn on Tuesday which, surprisingly, contain a 
proposal to actually return the F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan, 
something which has evoked strong congressional opposition.
    
A State Department official, who normally responds to all media 
queries regarding South Asia, said various options were being 
discussed by the US government to resolve the F-16 issue and they 
ranged from "some not so practical to others fairly do-able."
    
These options, according to documents obtained by Dawn include 
writing off Pakistan's PL-480 debt by US, restoration of the USAID 
programme, waiving the storage charges that Pakistan is being 
forced to pay for the parked F-16 aircraft, restoration of the IMET 
military-to-military exchange programme, helping Pakistan to 
overcome some of its domestic problems such as population planning 
and democracy-building measures and encouraging Pakistan to meet 

its internal, rather than external, threats as they pose the 
maximum danger to the country.
    
President Clinton's leading Muslim and Pakistani campaign fund 
donor, a New York business tycoon, has also suggested to the 
president that Pakistan should be allowed to upgrade its existing 
F-16 aircraft in Turkey, instead of delivering the obsolete models 
for which Pakistan made the payments of $658 million.
    
In his letter to Albright, Hamilton also discusses the pros and 
cons of the other proposals that are under consideration to resolve 
the issues between the two countries and specifically argues that 
"it may not be possible to have a successful presidential trip to 
Pakistan if we have not made any progress in addressing the F-16 
issue."
    
He states that if three years after President Clinton noted the 
unfairness of the US refusal to deliver the F-16s or refund the 
money, no progress is made in resolving the issue, "this will cast 
a cloud over the president's trip to Pakistan and preclude the 
resumption of anything approaching a normal relationship between 
the two countries."
    
Mr Hamilton is also worried about the Pakistani decision to take 
the US to court and has told the secretary of state that "this 
would naturally diminish the likelihood of a successful 
presidential visit and otherwise damage US-Pakistan relations."
    
According to the letter, Mr Hamilton understands that "there is 
some talk about the possibility of using a waiver to permit the 
Clinton administration to transfer the F-16s to Pakistan, 
notwithstanding the Pressler Amendment." Observers noted that Mr 
Hamilton's letter had actually revealed that the possibility of 
delivery of the planes to Pakistan was being discussed in some 
circles although it is clear that it would almost be impossible to 
get an approval from the Congress for this proposal.
About the idea of writing off Pakistan's PL-480 debt and other 
foreign debts, Mr Hamilton told the secretary of state it was an 
idea worth exploring.
    
He also raises the possibility of restoration of aid to Pakistan by 
re-starting the USAID programme by linking it to the return of the 
Pakistani money.
    
"I am told that at least some legal experts believe that a number 
of US programmes and sales would have to be shut down as soon as 
Pakistan files the suit," he says.
    
"If this is correct, Pakistan should be made aware of this at the 
earliest possible date to ensure that Pakistan understands fully 
that bringing a suit against the US will adversely impact on its 
own interests," Mr Hamilton suggested.

<a name="lbpo">LB polls on census-based voters lists, orders LHC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, April 30: Justice Falak Sher of the Lahore High Court 
effectively stayed local councils elections in the Punjab on 
Thursday afternoon when he accepted Tehrik-i-Insaaf leader Imran 
Khan's petition that they be held on the basis of the March census.
    
Advocate-General Khwaja Mohammad Sharif and Deputy Attorney- 
General Khwaja Saeeduz Zafar, who earlier vehemently contested the 
arguments of advocate Hamid Khan, the petitioner's counsel, said 
both the federal and provincial governments will challenge the 
order by an intra-court appeal.
    
Meanwhile, two other petitions challenging the validity of the 
nominated Panchayat tier in the local government and ban on 
political parties from participating in the May 20 polls are 
pending decision by Justice Amir Alam Khan after conclusion of 
arguments. Yet another petition for postponement of the poll until 
after the Chehlum of Imam Husain (AS) is being heard by a division 
bench.
    
The Local Councils Election Authority, which is headed by Justice 
Malik Muhammad Qayyum of the high court, is proceeding apace with 
the poll schedule and disposed of appeals against rejection and 
acceptance of nomination papers on Thursday.
    
Justice Falak Sher, who is the LHC's senior puisne judge 
occasionally seized of constitutional petitions, accepted the law 
officers' plea that an electoral process once commenced should be 
allowed to take its course as held by the Supreme Court in the 1988 
National Assembly dissolution case and some other cases. He 
observed that he was not staying the election but only allowing a 
petition praying that they be held on the basis of the last 
preceding census as required by the law.
    
The judge had asked the law officers on the last date to find out 
from the authorities concerned whether the election could be held 
as scheduled on the basis of census results. He said he would not 
hear the stay application separately but would proceed with the 
main petition on the next date, that is, April 30.
    
Allowing the petition on Thursday, Justice Falak Sher observed that 
the latest population figures were required not only for more 
accurate electoral rolls or voters lists, delimitation of 
constituencies and status of urban municipalities but also for an 
efficient working of local government or 'grassroots democracy'. No 
public amenity or utility or welfare plan can properly function in 
the absence of correct demographic data. He, however, made it clear 
that the controversy in the present petition was confined to voters 
lists.
    
The census figures, the judge observed, must by now have reached 
the district headquarters and other administrative units and the 
voters lists of February 1997 general election, which were 
originally prepared on the basis of the 1981 census, can be updated 
by comparison with them. The federal and provincial law officers 
had earlier stated that it may take nearly a year to compile and 
publish the census results. Advocate Hamid Khan said the government 
cannot be allowed to take advantage of its own 'inefficiency' in 
delaying the publication of a census report.
    
The judge pointed out that the census was held after a long 
interval of 17 years and was probably made possible by the 
induction of the army in the process of head count. When the DAG, 
in response to a court query, submitted that 19,506,855 (or 35.42 

per cent) of the total of 56,615,667 registered voters exercised 
their franchise in the February 1997 general election, the judge 
observed that, according to Press reports, similar claims were made 
about a referendum held in 1985.
    
The law officers, earlier, argued that the updating of voters lists 
is an ongoing process and annual revisions are conducted as 
required by the law and the Constitution. A wholesale revision was 
undertaken in 1995. Besides, there is no nexus between the census 
and the preparation of electoral rolls.

<a name="smug">Smuggling of zero-duty goods detected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, April 28: The federal government agencies have detected 
that high-tariff items, carrying import duty between 40 and 45 per 
cent, are being smuggled as consignments enjoying zero tariff, 
under the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement.
    
The items now top those put at the highest tariff slab in the 1997-
98 federal budget which retained the import duty of a number of 
items at 45 per cent. 
    
The high import duty was levied to discourage import of these items 
in order to protect local industry.
    
Now, however, ministry of commerce officials are listing those as 
items imported through Karachi port by unscrupulous importers who 
transport the items to Afghanistan enjoying ATTA facility only to 
smuggle those back into Pakistan.
    
Important items on which 45 per cent import duty was retained in 
the 1997-98 budget included aspirin, paracetamol, tubes for 
bicycles, and a wide range of household goods.
    
Items carrying less import duty but are being smuggled under ATTA 
are over 200 in number. Commerce ministry officials are preparing a 
list of items that are to be brought into the notice of preventive 
staff to check their smuggling.
    
Some of the items are natural gums, resins, gum-resins and 
oleoresins (import duty on only related items reduced to 35%); fats 
of bovine animals, sheep or goats; chocolate and other food 
preparations containing cocoa (only chocolate chips kept at 35%); 
culture yeasts and seed yeast (raised from 35% to 45%); natural 
magnesium carbonate (only one new item, magnesium oxide added at 
15%); sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, peroxides of sodium or 
potassium (only two items, caustic potash and peroxide of sodium or 
potassium reduced to 15%); disodium sulphate; formic acid; ibprofen 
(a new item); aspirin; paracetamol; penicillin; adhesive dressing 
and other articles having an adhesive layer, and the related items 
(newly added); pigments and preparations based on cadmium 
compounds; lithophone (and related); stamping foils; dyes or 
colouring matter suitable for used in food or drink, or otherwise, 
and the related items; the entire range of essential oils, 
including concrete and absolutes, resinoids, extracted oleoresins, 
concentrate of essential oils in fats, in fixed oils, in waxes or 
the like, obtained by enfleurage or mexeration, terpenic by-

products of the deterpenation of essential oils, aqueous 
distillates and aqueous.
    
The new pneumatic tyres of rubber used for bicycles and pneumatic 
(retarded or used) tyres (not aircraft) have also been retained at 
40% import duty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, April 27: The Pakistan Air Force carried out a missile-
firing exercise here on Monday at an operational firing range.
    
Different types of aircraft and various air defence squadrons of 
the PAF participated in the event. Several types of air-to-air and 
surface-to-air missiles in the PAF's inventory, including the 
indigenously developed ANZA missile, were launched during the 
exercise.
    
The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Parvaiz Mehdi Qureshi, 
praised the standards of accuracy achieved in the exercise.
    
The air chief congratulated the technicians and operating crew for 
their skill in maintaining the missiles as well as achieving 
optimum scores.
    
The firing practice with live ammunition is an important feature in 
PAF's regular training to keep itself in a high state of 
operational readiness.

<a name="pmor">PM orders PIA to close routes giving no profit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, April 27: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday directed 
PIA to close down unprofitable routes and use the money saved to 
buy more planes for its fleet, improve passenger service and 
compete with the foreign airlines.
    
He said the government would not provide any protection or subsidy 
to the airline nor had the resources to do so, and it would like it 
to establish its excellence through competition.
    
Mr Sharif expressed these views while inaugurating the construction 
of a Rs 10.32 billion new terminal complex of the Lahore airport 
which will take 27 months to complete. The original cost of the 
project was Rs 13 billion which, according to an official, has been 
reduced through negotiations.
    
The foundation stone of the project was laid by Ms Benazir Bhutto 
as prime minister in 1996. However, the project could not take off 
because no contract was given to any company.
    
The prime minister said he was providing a level playing field to 
PIA and private sector airlines in the hope that the former would 
try to leave its rivals behind by providing better service and 
facilities to its customers. He said the PIA should not be afraid 
of competition as it would automatically be the first choice of 
passengers if it provided them with better facilities.
    
Mr Sharif said survival through competition would be long lasting 
while protection and subsidies were no longer regarded as genuine 
business methods. In the 21st century, he said, PIA should try to 
run on its own, without expecting 'crutches' to be provided by the 
government.
    
He regretted that at present PIA's business was going to other 
airlines because the national carrier was not providing quality 
service.
    
Mr Sharif said his government would encourage private and foreign 
airlines to operate in Pakistan and would give them all possible 
facilities.
    
The PML government, the prime minister said, was modernizing the 
communications sector which played a vital role in the development 
of a country.
    
Mian Nawaz Sharif was of the view that Pakistan could earn foreign 
exchange by promoting tourism and tourism required airports in all 
parts of the country. 
    
Maintaining that the Lahore airport would now be among the most 
modern airports, he said funds allocated for the new terminal 
should be used judiciously.

<a name="case">Cases against all MQM legislators withdrawn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 30: All cases against the Muttahida Qaumi Movement 
legislators have been withdrawn. This was announced by the Sindh 
Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi on Thursday night.
    
Winding up the two-day debate on law and order situation in the 
Sindh Assembly, he said although none of his coalition partners had 
ever asked him to do so, going through the files he had found all 
the cases as unfounded and baseless.
    
"My friends sitting on the other side do not consider them 
Pakistani, forgetting their sacrifices for Pakistan. They are as 
much Pakistani as any of us."
    
Thursday was the second day of the debate  spread over seven- and-
half hours  in which the House witnessed a congenial atmosphere. 
While Liaquat Ali Jatoi pleaded the case of MQM legislators, the 
MQM speakers, particularly Dr Farooq Sattar and Qazi Khalid made 
stunning speeches blunting the attack of PPP leaders, who tried 
their best to play up their differences.
    
Liaquat Jatoi said although the situation was not satisfactory, it 
far better than what he had inherited.
    
The opposition failed to make concrete suggestion for improving the 
law and order situation, he said.
    
Referring to the reasons which led to the prevailing condition, the 
chief minister said unemployment and denial of denial of rights to 
the people had caused frustration. The Nawaz government, he said, 
was pursuing a policy that would enable even the children of poor 
people to rise to the office of the chief minister.
    
He said peace and tranquillity could not be restored through extra-
judicial killings. For peace, the walls of hatred will have to be 
demolished.
Former Chief Minister Syed Muzaffar Hussain Shah and SNF leader 
Amir Bakhsh Bhutto delivered emotional speeches referring to 
Murtaza Bhutto's brutal murder at a time when his sister was in 
power.
    
Sher Mohammad Baloch of PPP and Minister Naseer Ahmad Khoso's 
speeches were philosophical, highlighting general aspects of the 
law and order situation.
    
Others who spoke from the treasury benches were Michael Javed, 
Farooq Awan, S. Mohiuddin, Ismail Rahoo and Jalal Mahmood Shah. 
Leader of opposition Nisar Khuhro, Syed Ghulam Shah, Dr Wahid 
Soomro, Dr Sohrab Sarki and Abdul Ghafoor Nizamani presented the 
opposition's viewpoint on the subject.
    
KHUHRO FLAYS: Mr Khuhro called upon all political parties to 
declare a Jihad against terrorist groups, stop inter-provincial 
movement of illicit weapons, and build moral pressure against those 
who were acting in a manner detrimental to the national interest.
    
The PPP leader demanded that those involved in serious crime should 
be immediately arrested and their cases should be disposed of as 
soon as possible. He said that during 1997, 687 men, 104 women, 21 
children, and 44 policemen were killed in the city.
    
He alleged that those who were being set free by the government 
were involved in acts of terrorism and heinous crime.
    
He also demanded that honest officials should be encouraged and 
that a non-partisan committee should be constituted to find out 
whether or not allotment of 66 plots was authorized by the chief 
minister or through fraudulent means.
    
Mr Khuhro launched a hard hitting attack on the coalition 
government in Sindh and held them responsible for the killings of 
Americans and Iranians, religious scholars, besides murder of 
innocent people including educationists, journalists and government 
officials.
    
Mr Khuhro expressed concern over rising graph of crime in the city, 
which he said, had been caused by an unprecedented proliferation of 
illegal weapons.
    
Mr Khuhro also referred to incidents of car snatching and in this 
context cited CPLC reports.

<a name="sbpw">SBP warns Balochistan, Sindh over borrowings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, April 26: The State Bank on Sunday expressed concern over 
excessive borrowing from the SBP by the provinces of Sindh and 
Balochistan and urged them to voluntarily reduce their debtor 
balance within a stipulated time.
    
The concern was expressed by the bank's board of directors at a 
meeting under State Bank's Governor Dr Mohammad Yakub to review 
recent economic and financial developments.
    
The board directed the SBP governor to urge the two provinces to 
enforce financial discipline.
    
The directors' alarm came in the wake of reports that the centre 
had declined Sindh's demand for an extra 300 million rupees for 
maintaining law and order.
    
Various development projects in the province have stalled owing to 
resource constraint and the provincial government has decided to 
sell off some of the prize land in the city and elsewhere for 
generating funds to pay back debts and complete some of the 
development projects in communications, education and health.
    
The Sindh government has been advocating that its debts have 
increased owing to huge expenses on the maintenance of law and 
order.
    
The SBP governor was also directed to ensure that aggregate 
government borrowing for budgetary support, which had so far 
remained "well below" the Credit Plan target, did not exceed Rs 58 
billion at any time during the year.
    
The board directed the governor to ensure a "judicious balance" 
between adequate credit availability for productive activities in 
the private sector and maintenance of credit discipline to avoid 
refuelling inflation.
    
The SBP board was also informed that Pakistan's exports had grown 
by 4.6 per cent during the period July '97-March '98, substantially 
below the target for the year. The board noted that export 
performance might have been better but for adverse effects of the 
Asian financial crisis. However, the board noted that a slower 
export growth was more than offset by a sharper decline of 11.5 per 
cent in imports with the result that the trade gap narrowed from US 
dollar 2.6 billion in July 1996-March 97 to $1.3 billion in July 
97-March 98.
    
A reduction in trade deficit, combined with increased remittances 
and foreign currency deposits of residents, led to a significant 
improvement in the current account of the balance of payments.
    
The SBP board was of a view that improved current account position 
and increased inflow of long-term external financing enabled the 
country to meet all its external obligations and also led to the 
strengthening of foreign exchange reserves, which increased to 1.4 
billion dollars on April 24.
    
This was attributed to a "prudent demand management" policy that 
had also helped bring down inflation and improve the current 
account balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves.
    
At the outset the SBP governor reviewed the recent economic and 
financial developments and in particular, informed the board that 
there were signs of an improvement in macroeconomic indicators.

The meeting was chaired by State Bank governor Dr Mohammad Yakub. 
Those who attended the deliberations were Mr Mueeen Afzal, Mr Sadiq 
Sayeed Khan, Mr Tariq Sayeed Saigol, Syed Mohammad Mohsin, Mr 
S.R.Poonegar, Mr Abdullah J. Memon and Mr Usman Yahya.

ISLAMABAD, April 25: Pakistan said on Saturday that India was 
taking escalatory steps towards overt nuclearization and warned 
that Islamabad would respond by taking appropriate measures to 
ensure its security.
    
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf, referring to the reported 
statement of Indian foreign policy adviser Nagendra Nath Jha on 
Friday that India might induct nuclear weapons into its arsenal 
without conducting test, said the latest statement was an 
acknowledgement by India of its clandestine possession of nuclear 
weapons that "it now intends to bring out from the basement."
    
He said "induction connotes deployment" and this was apt to shatter 
the prospects of promoting non-proliferation in South Asia.
Jha, who also heads the foreign affairs committee of the BJP 
government, had said during a lecture in Colombo on Friday that it 
was possible to induct nuclear weapons without testing them and it 
was one way of circumventing the US law (on nuclear testing) and 
evading sanctions.
    
The spokesman said declaration by Jha revealed the "very dangerous 
gradual escalatory approach" of the Indian government.
    
Mr Altaf said the Bhartiya Janata Party government was trying to 
carry out its resolve of exercising the option to induct nuclear 
weapons and urged the international community to take serious 
notice of the alarming developments in the region.
    
He said Pakistan could not remain unconcerned over the developments 
and would take all appropriate steps to ensure its security.
    
Spokesman Tariq Altaf stressed that Jha's statement should not be 
seen in isolation, particularly, since the ruling BJP had made 
known its policy regarding nuclear weapons.
    
Political observers and analysts note that the Indian missile plan 
and nuclear developments which pushed Pakistan into adopting 
counter measures had put the two of the world's most populous and 
poorest nations on a self-defeating course of military 
confrontation with most horrifying prospects, unless restrained by 
political wisdom.

<a name="reve">Revenue targets to be raised by 15pc</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, April 28: The budget of 1998-99 is expected to set 
targets of revenue and income generation at least 15 per cent 
(aggregate) higher than those set for the financial year 1997-98, 
official sources said. 
   
The inflow of money is needed to be increased by 15 per cent in 
1998-99, and not by 10 per cent, as projected for 1997-98.
    
The 1997-98 estimates for resource generation and spending have 
proved optimistic. The spending during the last three quarters of 
the current fiscal year having gone beyond the estimates by at 
least 8 per cent (over and above the in-built care for inflation), 
while the resources proved on the down side by at least 7 per cent, 
indicating a gap of at least Rs70 billion (over and above the 
ceiling set for the borrowing).
   
The 12-month overall 1997-98 resource-spending gap, now being 
estimated to be no less than that of Rs125 billion. The government 
efforts to cut down the spending on the development and 
establishment sides "are not expected to impact the spending by 
even 1 per cent", said a senior official.

The exercise, currently being carried out for the preparation of 
the next year's federal budget, is marred by striking backlogs on 
meeting the allocation commitments for the current financial year, 
and the government's worries about the resource crunch being 
estimated to appear in the next year's fiscal projections. 
    
Sources said that the carry forward impact of the gap will be the 
most important aspect of the 1998-99 budget, and the adjustments 
for resource-spending estimations now being carried out exclusively 
focus on this issue.
    
In line with this exercise, the federal government 
divisions/departments have been asked to furnish latest by May 10 
the revised expenditure estimates for the last financial quarter of 
the current and new estimates for the 1998-99 financial year.
    
These estimates are to be submitted for helping the ministry of 
finance in its ongoing first round of processing the projections of 
spending during the next financial year by the federal 
departments/divisions and attached departments/organizations. The 
first round is scheduled to end by May 15, during which the demands 
for grant would be finalized, while the second round, by June 1, 
1998, would see efforts for setting the estimates of revenue/income 
of the federal existing resources, and of those to be 
created/tapped during the next financial year.
    
Sources said that the failure of the revenue generating departments 
to meet targets and that of the major spending organs to remain 
within their allocation limits, caused the unprecedented gap, which 
is "to be prevented in 1998-99, positively". That is imperative 
even to avert a slide in the inflow of money in the next financial 
year below the transactions made in 1997-98, said the officials.

<a name="noad">No additional taxes planned, says Shahid </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent 

RAWALPINDI, April 29: The Governor of Punjab, Mr Shahid Hamid, on 
Wednesday said no additional taxes would be levied in the next 
provincial budget. 

Talking to newsmen at the governor's house, he said a final 
decision regarding the levying of taxes would be made by the 
cabinet. 

However, he added, the finance minister had been asked to reduce 
non- development expenditure and provide maximum relief to the 
common man in the next budget. 

Replying to a question about maintenance of law and order during 
Muharram, he said the Rangers and paramilitary forces would be 
called out if things got out of hand. 

The governor said in order to maintain sectarian harmony, the 
police had been alerted and special contingents deployed at all 
sensitive places. 

He said a code of ethics had been prepared after consultations with 
leaders of different schools of thought to avoid any sort of 
disturbance during the holy month. "If any religious group violates 
the code, stern action will be taken against it." 

Talking about wheat production, he said the total wheat production 
was expected to be 18.5 million tons. Answering a question about 

inflated utility bills, the governor said this problem would remain 
unless more dams were constructed. 

He said due to thermal power projects, the people were compelled to 
pay heavy bills, while water reserves were going to waste. "The 
quantity of water which is going to waste is sufficient for three 
new dams." 

Mr Shahid Hamid said he was enjoying the same perks and privileges 
which he was getting during the rule of the caretakers. Earlier at 
a meeting with the officer-bearers of the Rawalpindi Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (RCCI), he urged businessmen to pay taxes and 
extend cooperation in the removal of encroachments, improvement of 
the environment, extension of services in the medical and education 
sectors.

<a name="rupe">Rupee gains 31 paisa against $</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 30: The rupee recovered 31 paisa against the US 
dollar during the last three days in the kerb market as depressed 
demand for the greenback triggered its selling by speculators.
    
The dollar closed at 45.52 and 45.55 against the rupee in the kerb 
market on Thursday against the Monday close of 45.83 and 45.86.
    
The demand for the dollar both in the formal as well as kerb market 
has been bearish ever since banks started quoting their own rupee-
dollar exchange rates from March 24.
    
Senior bankers told Dawn the dollar has been trading at the lowest 
point in the band fixed for the banks to follow while determining 
their own dollar-rupee parities. Banks are supposed to buy or sell 
the greenback somewhere between Rs 45.05 and Rs 45.49.
    
The dollar has been under pressure against rupee for the last two 
three weeks in the formal market that covers inter-bank deals and 
transaction between banks and their clients. The reasons are 
simple: the exporters are desperate to sell their proceeds to get 
the rupee equivalent for financing their day to day operation 
because they are short of liquidity and the importers appear to be 
no more worried about any devaluation coming about and as such they 
are not making bee-lines for the dollar.
    
This is happening also because the exports have risen and the 
imports declined thereby increasing the supply of the dollar and 
reducing its demand.
    
The developments in the formal foreign exchange market has also 
depressed dollar prices in the kerb as speculators can no longer 
afford to keep waiting for a devaluation to come by and give them 
windfalls: They are desperately selling their stocks of the 
greenback because the stocks were piled up through rupee loans the 
servicing of which has now become a problem for the speculators who 
had not figured that the rupee could hold firm for such a long 
time.
    
Pakistan had last devalued the rupee by 8.7 per cent on 15th 
October last year and since then there were rumours of further 
devaluation making rounds in the kerb market.

<a name="cbrm">CBR may seek Rs17bn cut in tax collection target </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, April 27: The Central Board of Revenue is believed to be 
asking for a Rs 17 billion downward revision of the total tax 
collection target set for the financial year 1997-98. The original 
budgetary target of tax collection set for the CBR to achieve 
during the 12 months of the current financial year was Rs 324 
billion. This target was revised downward to Rs 305 billion at the 
end of February 1998 (by Rs 19 billion).
    
A Rs 17 billion further reduction in the target will bring down the 
estimate of tax collection for the current financial year to Rs 288 
billion. This step has been necessitated by an apparent Rs 36 
billion shortfall in the collection made in the first 10 months 
(July-April period).
    
The total target (as per revised figures) for this period, was Rs 
254 billion, whereas, the CBR collected only Rs 14 billion by April 
26, and the CBR officials hope to collect Rs 5 billion more, in the 
last four days of the month.
    
With the Rs 19 billion April collection added to the Rs 199 billion 
collection made by end of March, 1998, the total collection for 10 
months is now going to be Rs 218 billion, against the revised 
target of Rs 254 billion for the July-April period.
    
The CBR hopes to collect at the rate of Rs 35 billion per month, 
during the remaining two months of the current financial year, 
which, if accomplished, would mean another Rs 70 billion added to 
the already made collection of Rs 218 billion, and the total 
collection by end of the fiscal will be Rs 288 billion.
    
The Rs 17 billion shortfall, against the Rs 305 billion (revised) 
target, is being deemed "impossible" to do away with, and hence the 
CBR reportedly requesting for revising downward the already revised 
target of Rs 305 billion to Rs 288 billion.
    
However, senior CBR officials explained that, keeping in view the 
failure in meeting the April target of collection, the CBR might 
not even reach the figure of Rs 288 billion. The target for April 
was Rs 29 billion, whereas, the total collection expected at the 
end of April is Rs 19 billion, with a clear shortfall of Rs 10 
billion.
    
The per month collection target now being reset at Rs 35 billion 
for May and June 1998, is deemed "foolish" and "too optimistic" by 
these officials. They argue that the trend of per month collection 
in the July 97-April 98 period has been Rs 25.4 billion. "How can 
CBR collect Rs 35 billion a month, in May and June. There are no 
indications of the imports going up, the Sales Tax getting better, 
and the Income Tax and Excise duty bettering its collection." They 
added that "at best, the CBR can collect Rs 30 billion a month in 
May and June 98. This would mean the total collection to be made 
during the entire current financial year will be Rs 278 billion, 
and not Rs 288 billion."

<a name="kick">Kickbacks detected in IPPs deals, says PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 29: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said here on 
Wednesday that serious irregularities, including payment of 
kickbacks and commissions, had been detected in the contracts with 
the IPPs.
    
"A lot of corrupt practices have been noticed in which the 
Independent Power Producers(IPPs) indulged, that call for a 
thorough investigation ", he said.
    
He told reporters after inaugurating a two-day second meeting of 
SAARC commerce ministers that the former PPP government had signed 
extremely high power purchase agreements(PPA) against the national 
interest." The poor people of Pakistan cannot afford those power 
tariffs".
    
"The IPPs would have to reduce their power tariffs as the country's 
economic situation does not permit us to continue honouring 
contracts with them", the prime minister said.
    
But he believed that the IPP power tariff issue had been 
complicated due to statements and what was being written in the 
press. "But I want to tell you that we will decide the power tariff 
issue through mutual consultations and within the law of the land".
    
Mr Sharif said the IPPs should realise the gravity of the situation 
and voluntarily reduce their power tariffs so that suffering of the 
common man could be mitigated to some extent.
    
Asked whether the job of investigating the payment of kickbacks and 
commissions had been handed over to the Ehtesab Bureau, he said it 
was the government which was looking into the issue.
    
The prime minister was asked by a reporter why the government 
should accept high-power tariffs, specially when some of the same 
companies, also operating in Bangladesh, were charging less in that 
country. "That is why we have taken up the issue", he replied.
    
Asked whether he himself would announce the agreement that had been 
reached with the IPPs, as was claimed by the chief of Ehtesab 
Bureau, Saifur Rehman, Mr Sharif said: "Nothing has so far been 
finalised and as such how could I announce anything". 
   
He, however, hoped the IPPs would eventually reduce their power 
tariffs."We are trying to find out an amicable solution to the 
problem".
    
POWER EXPORT: Answering a question, he said his government was 
looking into possibilities of exporting surplus power to 
India."Originally, the proposal came from former Indian prime 
minister I.K. Gujral when I met him in Edinburgh last year and I 
had expressed my willingness to consider the matter" , he added.
    
"I believe we can still hold talks on exporting electricity to 
India", he said. The prime minister pointed out the issue could not 
be discussed and finalised because the Gujral government did not 
last.
    
To another question, the prime minister said his government wanted 
to resolve all outstanding issues with India through dialogue."My 
government is keen to develop normal relations with India", he 

said,praising his Indian counterpart Mr Vajpayee who, he believed, 
also wanted to have friendly relations between the two countries. 
He said he had received a letter from the Indian prime minister in 
which he had expressed his willingness for the resumption of talks 
between the two countries."I am sure the deadlock will end soon."
    
However, Mr Sharif voiced concern over the killing of a number of 
innocent people by Indian fores near the Line of Control on Monday 
last. He said such incidents always increased tension in the region 
and, "I would expect them(Indian) to help resolve issues through 
dialogue".

<a name="$5bn">$5bn worth loans added to debt stock in a year</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE FIRST full financial year of this government is coming to a 
close with the national economy having been burdened with an 
additional debt of as much as $5 billion in foreign exchange as 
well as in rupee equivalent.
    
Part of this debt is, no doubt concessional, but the additional 
burden on the debt servicing head of the budget which had already 
reached the back-breaking proportion of Rs 270 billion in the 
budget for 1997-98, may well serve as the last straw on the camel's 
back.
    
Most of this additional borrowing has been done by the government 
from non-banking sources which include multilateral agencies whose 
loans carry very easy terms and also from international commercial 
lenders who charge very high interest rates with short repayment 
periods of one to two years.
    
Some of these loans have been contracted to roll over the loans 
obtained in the recent past by the caretaker government of Meraj 
Khalid. But most loans are fresh to meet the balance of payments 
obligations as well as the burgeoning budgetary deficit.

Creative accounting

By resorting to some clever and creative accounting, the government 
has succeeded in camouflaging these borrowings as non- bank and 
non-budgetary to keep the overall budgetary deficit from appearing 
to have gone well past the IMF-prescribed limit of 5 per cent of 
the GDP.
    
The government concedes that the budgetary deficit had already 
crossed the 5 per cent of GDP limit but insists that the 
overshooting is no more than a fraction of one per cent.
    
However, if one were to take into account all the borrowings into 
consideration including those obtained from multilateral aid 
agencies, plus those resources borrowed by corporations by pledging 
their assets and future sales but still against sovereign 
guarantees, then it is more than likely that by the year-end the 
overall budgetary deficit would go well past 8 per cent of the GDP, 
the figure the first Nawaz government had succeeded in achieving in 
its second year.
    
Unfavourable conditions

In fact the government is even now needing more of the same and is 
planning to launch fixed term bonds for the purpose. Earlier it had 
been decided to launch the bonds sometime soon after the first 

quarter of the current financial year. But the launch was postponed 
due to unfavourable circumstances which would either have increased 
painfully high the cost of the loans being procured through these 
bonds or faced the ignominy of getting no takers because of what is 
regarded internationally as too risky a rating of Pakistan.
    
Since things are still unfavourable for Pakistan, therefore, the 
government is considering tapping alternative sources of raising 
fresh loans such as through securitising the workers's remittances 
for about $300 million.
    
The advantage that the government had gained due to remarkable 
improvement in the current account due to a virtual collapse in 
imports and massive increase in remittances and foreign currency 
account deposits, however, did not get reflected in the foreign 
exchange reserves because of the collapse of exports of equal 
severity. Therefore, the FER is hovering at about a billion dollars 
against the IMF target for the year of $1.7 billion.
    
The government may also feel satisfied with the performance of the 
agricultural sector during the year. But except for helping the 
overall economy achieve a respectable growth rate, the satisfactory 
performance of the agricultural sector has not helped boost exports 
or keep the imports of wheat and edible oils under control.
    
Analysts said that this 'generosity' would last for another about 
10 months or so and by February next year all these sources would 
dry up suddenly and the country would be left high and dry to fend 
for itself from its own resources. So, the government has between 
now and February 1999 to do something about its balance of payments 
position as well as its budgetary deficit.

Tall order

Can the government achieve this miracle in the time available to 
it?

On paper it is possible. All that the government needs to do is to 
keep the imports at their present level and boost export at the 
rate of 20 per cent.
    
In order to boost exports by that extent, all that the government 
needs to do is to get the industrialists to produce the needed 
surpluses. And the higher revenues generated by the resultant 
accelerated economic growth should then be collected by the CBR 
efficiently and honestly.

<a name="contr">Contracts for cotton exports cancelled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 25: Cotton export contracts worth Rs700 million or 
70,000 bales were cancelled as some of the leading Southeast Asian 
importers failed to open Letters of Credit(L/Cs) within the 
stipulated, time owing to recent financial crisis and the 
consequent liquidity problems.
    
But most of them have indicated to the local exporters to settle 
the account under the international trade law and pay penalty 
arising out of their inability to arrange for the physical shipment 
within 180 days after the signing of the contract, exporters said.

The recent financial crisis in some of the Southeast Asian 
countries could have severe impact on Pakistan's current export 
drive, sources at the local export houses claim.
    
"Indonesia has in the recent past emerged as one of the leading 
cotton importers from Pakistan, but its battered economy has 
significantly curtailed its total demand", they maintained.
    
Local export houses have to register all the export contracts with 
the State Bank indication f.o.b or c.i.f selling prices and quality 
of lint contracted to be shipped but they are bound to ensure 
shipment within six months.
    
"Failure to meet the physical shipment deadline could well mean 
forfeiture of cash security of three per cent of the total sale 
value of the contract by the central bank", they added.
    
The exporters have made total forward sales of cotton totalling 
0.470 million bales, worth about Rs5 billion against which they 
have already physically shipped 0.400 million bales up to April 15, 
1998 since Sept 1,1997.
    
"We are looking for alternate buyers to sell the contracted 
consignments," they added.
    
Some other exporters said the current fall in the international 
prices of cotton including the New York Cotton Exchange to 63 cents 
per lb followed by news that China will sell 1.2 million bales to 
clear old stock could make things a bit difficult but "we hope to 
net new affluent buyers from the same countries ".

<a name="stoc">Stocks finish with extended fall of 15.54 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 30: Shares on the Karachi Stock Exchange on Thursday 
finished with an extended fall on renewed selling but unlike 
previous sessions there were buyers at the dips.
Strong short-covering in pivotals at the fag end of the session at 
lower levels despite a long weekend ahead has raised hopes that the 
market could pull itself out from the current impasse when trading 
resumes next week.
    
Early selling in part was also attributed to coming holidays as the 
market will remain close on Friday on account of May day and 
Saturday and Sunday being official closures.

The KSE 100-share index suffered a fresh setback of 15.54 points at 
1,562.23 as compared to 1,577.77 a day earlier, wiping out Rs 3 
billion from market capitalization at Rs 431 billion.
    
"The tussle on power tariff might not have shaken the confidence of 
foreign investors and there could be certainly some rethinking on 
the issue," some analysts said adding: "The stage whether or not to 
invest here is yet to come."
    
They said the current weakness of the dollar against rupee is 
reflective of the fact what might be going off the scene.
    
"The rupee has no apparent sound reason to be stronger except hasty 
liquidation by those who are on their way out," most leading floor 
brokers believe.
    
Telecard whose foreign investors have sold their stake in it rose 
to its pre-reaction level of Rs 27, up Rs 7.

Trading in it was allowed only on spot basis after a business of 
0.156 million shares was transacted apparently to forestall further 
increase in its share value.
    
Other good gainers were led by Escort Bank, Jahangir Siddiqui & Co, 
KASB & Co, Adamjee Insurance and leading MNCs such as Glaxo- 
Wellcome, Reckitt and Colman and Alico, which posted gains ranging 
from one rupee to Rs 3.15.
    
Shell Pakistan came in for renewed selling, apparently owing to 
power cut issue, and fell further by Rs 11.50 and Rs 20 for both 
ordinary and right shares, followed by Lever Brothers, which also 
suffered a fresh decline of Rs 35 at Rs 1,510.
    
MCB, Metropolitan Bank, Century Insurance, Dewan Salman and Bengal 
Fibre also came in for active selling at higher levels and suffered 
fall ranging from Rs 1.05 to Rs 3.90.
    
Among MNCs apart from Shell Pakistan, BOC Pakistan, Fauji 
Fertilizer, Sandoz Pakistan and Lever Brothers also remained under 
pressure and ended further lower, the biggest fall of Rs 60 being 
in Lever Brothers.
    
Trading volume fell to 38.831 million shares from the previous 
40.156 million shares owing to absence of leading sellers. Out of 
173 actives, 57 shares rose, 69 fell with 47 holding on to the last 
levels.
Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, up 
15 paisa on 0.523 million shares, followed by PSO, off Rs 5.10 on 
0.330 million shares, Southern Electric, unchanged on 0.233 million 
shares, Dewan Salman, easy Rs 1.05 on 0.225 million shares, and 
Dhan Fibre, lower 10 paisa on 0.225 million shares.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Crescent Spinning came in for active selling 
on this counter and ended off 35 paisa on 35,500 shares. Crescent 
Board followed it, accounting for 6,500 shares.

YET again, on April 23, I found myself before the Bench of the 
Supreme Court presided over by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, sitting 
with Justices Munawar Ahmed Mirza and Abdul Rahman Khan, appointed 
to enquire into the disgraceful events of that sad November day and 
to establish whether those involved in the attack can be charged 
with contempt or not.
    
The Judges were angry. They expressed their 'dissatisfaction' over 
my explanation given under oath on the first day of the hearing as 
to how I had come by the video cassette recording of the events of 
November 28, of which, after verifying its authenticity, I had a 
copy made and forwarded it to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court for him to take appropriate action. In response, I expressed 
my helplessness over their dissatisfaction.
    
Once more I explained how much mail I receive each day, either by 
post, by hand or by courier  correspondence (mostly requests that 
I write on certain subjects), circulars, magazines, cassettes of 
political speechifying, of maulvis preaching, of dancers dancing, 
of singers singing, etc.
    
I did not explain that my feeling upon receiving the cassette was 
that whoever had sent it had sent it so that I should write upon 
the subject particularly as I am shown on the recording as being 
present in the Court that day.
    
My earlier written request that I be provided with an unedited 
version of the CCTV recording of November 28 was not considered 
appropriate and was denied. However, my affidavit filed on the 23rd 
was taken on record. It reads as follows :
    
"Pursuant to my Affidavits of 20/3/98 and 1/4/98 and their 
attachments, which have been taken on record, and my request of 
10/4/98 that I be provided with a copy of the unedited full-length 
film recorded by the CCTV cameras of the Supreme Court on November 
28 1997 on which day I was present in the honourable Supreme Court 
and was witness to the storming of the Supreme Court by, inter 
alia, parliamentarians, members and supporters of the Pakistan 
Muslim League, the ruling party :
    
"I, Ardeshir Cowasjee, son of Rustom Fakirjee Cowasjee, Parsi, 
adult, citizen of Pakistan, resident of 10 Mary Road, Karachi, do 
hereby solemnly state :
    
"1) That the framers of our contempt laws never envisaged the 
possibility that the government of the day would organise a mob to 
storm the Supreme Court whilst in session, i.e. commit contempt in 
the face of the Court. The procedure laid down in Order 27 Rule 
7(2) of the Supreme Court Rules reflects this.
    
"2) That it is on record that the first law officer of the people, 
Attorney General Chaudhry Farooq, has himself committed contempt in 
the face of the Court. During the 1993-96 PPP government of Benazir 
Bhutto, Advocate Chaudhry Farooq, defending an Ittefaq case in the 
Lahore High Court, swore at the presiding Judge, Mr Justice Munir A 
Shaikh, in open court, using the crudest of language. For this 
blatant contempt committed in the face of the court, the honourable 
presiding Judge could have convicted and imprisoned him.
    
"3) That Advocate Chaudhry Farooq was not prosecuted does not 
deviate from or alter the fact that he abused an honourable High 
Court Judge in open court, thus committing contempt in the face of 
the court.
    
"4) That with the advent of the PML government of Nawaz Sharif, the 
Prime Minister appointed as Attorney General of Pakistan, as the 
people's lawyer, his own lawyer, Ittefaq's lawyer, Advocate 
Chaudhry Farooq.
    
"5) That the judiciary and the people accepted him, without 
protest, as the first law officer of the land rests heavily on the 
heads of the people and even more heavily on the heads of those in 
power and authority who could have opposed his nomination and 
subsequent appointment, and, additionally, this advocate can hardly 
be considered to be competent to aid the Supreme Court in the 
investigation it is now conducting to establish the identity of 
those members of the ruling party who had either organised the 
storming or were leading the mob, or were with the mob on November 
28, 1997.

"6) That at the last hearing on April 1, 1998, when Mr Justice 
Nasir Aslam Zahid asked the Deputy Attorney General, Mian Tariq 
Mahmood, to identify additional members of the attacking mob, as 
shown in the video recording, the latter was honest enough to admit 
that it would be an exercise in futility as all the Muslim League 
members would take their oaths and recite the same story.
    
"7) That when examined on April 1, 1998, the officers of the 
Islamabad police force regretted their inability to identify any of 
those seen on the video recording, pleading that many people had 
been brought in from Lahore and/or other parts of the Province. It 
is safe to presume that not one government factotum, whether under 
oath or not, will tell the truth.
    
"8) That on April 20, 1998, members of the opposition party, the 
PPP, held a demonstration outside the Assembly building. The police 
force present there, less in number than they were when on duty at 
the Supreme Court on November 28, 1997 and not clad in riot gear as 
they were that day, laid into the PPP demonstrators, injuring 
several, including parliamentarians.
    
"9) That, evidently, on April 20, 1998, the government's intent was 
to defend the 'honour' and 'sanctity' of their Parliament in the 
manner in which it did. Had its intent been clean and honest on 
November 28, 1997, it could that day have defended the 'honour' and 
'sanctity' of the Supreme Court and thus saved it from contempt and 
desecration. This further illustrates the complicity and 
acquiescence of the government in the shameful events of November 
28, 1997.
    
"10) That violence can breed nothing but violence. Had the crowd of 
November 28, 1997 been controlled, and the rowdies arrested and 
jailed immediately, it is highly likely that many violent events 
that have subsequently occurred, including the police action of 
April 20, 1998 in the precincts of the Assembly building, would not 
have taken place."
    
On the day of the previous hearing, the Judges had ordered the 
Deputy Attorney General that he arrange to produce in Court on 
April 23 Mushtaq Tahirkheli who was at that time on Haj. The DAG 
explained that Tahirkheli had returned from Haj, but was 'unwell' 
and in Lahore and had declined to be present. Justice Zahid asked 
him to get him to the Court the following day. The DAG explained, 
"But it is Friday tomorrow." "Quite so," responded Justice Zahid, 
"If today is Thursday, then tomorrow is Friday." "I don't think he 
will come," said the DAG. So it was settled that Tahirkheli would 
be called during the coming week.
    
Tahirkheli is the PM's political secretary who had unsuccessfully 
heckled former Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in his Court on 
November 27, shouting and screaming, "No chief justice, no supreme 
court. . . . what kind of justice are you dispensing," and was 
amongst the slogan-mongering flag-waving stormers of the Court on 
November 28. For this he was sacked, jailed, then released and 
garlanded, and finally re-employed by the Prime Minister in the 
same post. All very proper and logical.

All that the DAG managed to produce on April 23 was the President 
of the Nawaz Sharif Force, Shahbaz Goshi of Rawalpindi. He declared 
himself to be 30 years old, his occupation to be 'ex-student' with 
no regular source of income. He commands a Force of over 2,500 men 
dispersed all over Pakistan, with some 2,000 in the RWP-ISL area, 
whose mission it is to spread the gospel of Nawaz Sharif. The Force 
receives no funding other than donations collected by its members. 
It liaises with the Shahbaz Force and with the MSF. He confirmed he 
was present outside the Court building on the day of the storming.
    
DAG Mian Tariq Mahmood is a likeable, pragmatic man. A relative of 
the Attorney General, he is about to be made a High Court judge. 
The men of the administration were unable to identify any further 
persons on the video cassette, but had provided a list of 23 
persons identified from press photographs and by others who know 
them. The DAG more or less expressed his helplessness to produce 
these people in Court as they would not come when called. The Court 
would have to summon them. What about members of the administration 
who were present that day, the Court asked? Produce them. But, 
protested the DAG, the entire administration was present.
    
It was finally ordered that the DAG obtain affidavits from all 
those identified, and produce in Court ten from the list of 23 on 
April 28 and a further ten on April 29. A doleful-looking DAG 
mumbled something about the impossibility of coming up with either 
affidavits or live bodies.

<a name="whos">Who's paying the bills?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

OVER the years, as I have watched politicians and political parties 
in action from close up, I have often wondered who pays for it all.
    
For instance, we read every day about our leaders flying off from 
one city to another. And when they get on a plane, they travel 
first class, notwithstanding their populist rhetoric. You and I may 
shop around, finding out about the night coach, or the fares on the 
private airlines, and at best flying economy on PIA, but nothing 
but the best for our politicians. They fly to Islamabad and Lahore 
as often as the rest of us drive downtown. Just to update readers 
who have not flown recently, the first class return fare from 
Karachi to Islamabad is Rs 13,500.
    
And obviously, leaders can hardly be expected to travel alone apart 
from needing somebody to carry their briefcases (or handbags), 
there has to be at least one hanger-on to queue at the check-in 
counter and get the boarding cards, as well to collect the luggage 
at the destination. It helps if you go through the VIP lounge 
because there is no shortage of flunkeys to fetch and carry there. 
Oh yes, these bastions of privilege are still functioning despite 
Nawaz Sharif's promises to do away with "VIP culture."
    
Apart from these frequent overnight visits to the capital and other 
cities within Pakistan, there is the whole other scene involving 
endless foreign travel. London is a very popular destination among 
our politicians, no doubt because of the presence of Harrods, and 
for lesser political lights, Marks and Spencer. As a result of 
their frequent visits there, politicians have bought up a lot of 
property: obviously, they need somewhere to stay on these 
exhausting trips. Key figures in the government and in the 
opposition are alleged to have houses and flats in and around 
London worth millions of pounds.

But we are more concerned in this column to discover where the 
spending money is coming from. Return tickets to London, even in 
economy class, can set you back from thirty to forty thousand, and 
here, too, no heavyweight leader worth his (or her) salt travels 
alone. Add the cost of the shopping, and you can easily end up with 
a tab of a couple of lakhs per trip.
    
Altaf Hussain's self-exile in London over the last few years has 
been a bonanza for our jaunt-loving politicians. Every time he 
wishes, battalions of his party members and his nominal allies in 
the Muslim League board the first available flight for a quick 
pilgrimage. And then there are the interminable phone calls back 
and forth which must put a dent even in the inexhaustible "party 
funds" available to the MQM.
    
Now none of these trips pose a financial problem to the party in 
power at any given moment. After all, there is a long tradition of 
identifying party interests with state interests. In such a 
situation, it is only just and logical that the exchequer (i.e., 
you and I) should foot the bill for all these frequent trips. 
   
The interesting thing is that this travel pattern does not change 
whether or not politicians are in power. The only difference is 
that when their party is turfed out, they use the money they 
acquired in the good old days when they were calling the shots.
    
Then there is the whole other (and more expensive) question of 
legal fees. It goes without saying that politicians out in the cold 
are, almost by definition, enmeshed in a multitude of court cases. 
Indeed, much of their travels are determined by court hearings. So 
air fare apart, who pays the legal costs? I know that through great 
foresight, leaders have traditionally included legal at the highest 
echelon of their parties.
   
But even these lawyers have to pay their juniors and run their 
offices. Given the interminable nature of these cases, surely some 
cash would have to be shelled out. Our politicians are so 
accustomed to freebies that I do not see them paying a penny 
towards their own defence. So who is under-writing this vast legal 
operation?
    
Here again, the party in power enjoys a huge financial advantage as 
the entire legal machinery of the government - a huge if cumbersome 
establishment - rolls into operation to flatten the enemy, i.e. the 
opposition. Once more, party interests equal state interests, and 
therefore the exchequer is available to pay the most expensive 
lawyers in the land. The attorney-general is reduced to the role of 
a party lawyer, and the entire higher judiciary is caught up in 
hearing cases lodged by the government against the opposition, and 
vice versa. 
   
The process is interminable, and very, very expensive. President 
Clinton has had to raise money for his defence through appeals to 
the Democratic Party faithful. Here leaders in power simply use the 
justice ministry as their personal legal advisers.
    
The next thing I am curious about is what happens to the money that 
accompanies each application for a party ticket at election time. 
As there are up to a dozen applications for each constituency, 
accompanied by up to a lakh, and only one aspirant gets the ticket, 
there is a lot of unexplained cash out there. I know for a fact 
that unsuccessful applications do not get a refund, nor do they 
expect one.
   
I also know that every candidate is expected to finance his own 
campaign: there is no such thing as a "party fund" which is tapped 
for financing middle-class candidates because, apart from the MQM, 
there are none. Indeed, the only criterion the major parties apply 
in awarding tickets is the candidate's ability to lay out serious 
money to get elected.
    
Given the lack of accountability that prevails at every level of 
every party, it should come as no surprise when these politicians 
go berserk upon attaining power. Not only do they have to settle 
scores with their opponents, they have to replenish their depleted 
bank accounts. With such high stakes in politics, the venom and 
vindictiveness that surround it are understandable.
    
One final question; when our politicians seem to do so little 
productive and useful, who pays the bills at home? We all know that 
they are unemployed and unemployable so how does the kitchen run?
   
How are school fees paid? And who pays for all the long-distance 
calls? As I said, the party in power has no problems with these 
petty expenses, and both Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto keep 
reminding us of their wealth. But how about the lesser lights?
    
Until we demand to know, politics in Pakistan will continue to 
remain as corrupt as it is today.

<a name="ghau">Ghauri won't rock the region</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
General Mirza Aslam Beg

A POISON, very often, is a cure for poison. Poet Iqbal very aptly 
said: ke zahr bhi kabhi karta hai kare tiryaq: (Venom sometimes 
acts as an anti-body to protect the individual from murderous 
onslaught of virus and venom). Regional peace, similarly, if 
threatened by slings and arrows in India's modern weaponry 
parlance, such as Prithvi, Agni, Trishul and Nag  necessitated the 
test-firing of Ghauri missile, to serve as a therapy for power 
imbalance  a missile essentially to maintain peace and stability. 
It is an implicit message to India to see the futility of arms race 
and to refrain from exhibiting any intimidating posture.
    
It is not in the psyche of Pakistan, to compromise out of fear. It 
is an attitudinal predisposition  a legacy of a very rich 
civilizational heritage, as fighting outnumbered and out-weaponed 
is the distinctive feature of all classical battles Muslims have 
fought with their adversaries. A gesture of accommodation and 
reciprocal respect, however, is a great inducement for Pakistanis 
to respond in geometric proportion in interpersonal dealings.
    
The situation is no different in the realm of international 
relations. The failure to grasp this reality is the single most 
impediment to the prosperity and well-being of the region. The 
language of terror, which India chooses to communicate with, not 
only alienates Pakistan, but makes the entire South Asia a boiling 
cauldron of tension and mistrust. Thus a haunting morbidity 
vitiates the South Asian geopolitical climate.
    
What is simply an egoistic need of India is transformed into a 
strategic choice to join the prestigious nuclear club in order to 
qualify for a permanent seat in the Security Council and thus be 
able to exercise the power of veto over the affairs of the world. 
Indeed, it is this grandiose vision which propels India to perceive 
itself as a nuclear elitist in the region and the solitary wielder 
of nuclear power. The desperation with which it is pursuing missile 
programme  medium and long range  transcends any rational 
security consideration. It emanates from a deeper urge to reign 
supreme with a display of nuclear might.
    
Why is India so obsessed with seeking power parity with the five 
members of the security council? The rationale can be found in 
Subrahmanyam's words, who very candidly expressed in 1972: "India's 
role is not that of a middle power; her area and population rule 
that out. India will in the next two or three decades become a 
major power and if it fails to do that external pressure will break 
her up. It is extremely unlikely that without adequate power, 
understood in all its ramifications, this country with its 500 
million people will stay together at the end of the two decades".
    
The message to go nuclear was implicit in the depiction of what he 
termed "adequate power ... understood in all its ramifications." It 
is no wonder that only two years later  1974  the region 
experienced atomic test blast, ironically named Smiling Buddha 
juxtaposition of opposites. To hide the real intent it was 
publicized as a "peaceful explosion". Lt Gen Sen rightly commented: 
"The distinction between a peaceful nuclear explosion and a 
devastating nuclear bomb is so fine that it is difficult to 
ascertain where the dividing line is. In fact, only a political 
decision separates them". The deep-seated propensity to emerge as a 
nuclear power, is thus typical of Indian strategic mind. Jonathan 
Power is more explicit and forthright: "India will always be 
regarded as a second rate developing country, unless it has its 
nuclear arsenal. China earned Nixon's respect when it went nuclear. 
India should do the same."
    
Placed in the predicament when its preponderant neighbour India, 
was overly flexing its military muscle, Pakistan's option to go 
nuclear was only a strategic compulsion. If it didn't, it would 
have amounted to playing second fiddle to India, a position totally 
repugnant to Pakistani sensibility, as it would have made the very 
creation of Pakistan a redundant venture.
    
Deviation from the sacrosanct principle enshrined in the UN 
Charter, the right of sovereign equality of nations, would reduce 
South Asia as a protectorate of India as a successor to the British 
Crown. This imperial mindset of India, makes the peace prospect 
utterly dismal, and Pakistan's modest nuclear policy and 
acquisition of missile technology is expressive of that strategic 
defiance; not to let India transgress limits of strategic 
propriety.
    
Pakistan intends to convey that its nuclear as well as missile 
acquisitive behaviour be viewed by its neighbours and the western 
strategic observers, with a touch of realism. Empathy is what is 
required. It is not Pakistan's unilateral action. It follows the 
Newtonian paradigm  every action has a reaction. India, as the 
initiator must face the onus of responsibility for nuclear and 
missile proliferation in the region.
    
All talk of bilateral signing of the NPT; making South Asia a 
nuclear-free zone; a regional solution to the nuclear imbroglio; 
embargo on missile production and similar other proposals have only 
proved exercises in futility. Seeking nuclear power is the 
overriding passion for India which blocks every sincere effort on 
the part of Pakistan to persuade it to exercise restraint.  
Pakistan had to enter the missile arena willy nilly, just as it had 
taken rightful steps to achieve nuclear parity with India and the 
right quantum of deterrence and then unilaterally restrain it at 
that threshold, beyond which it would have been a nuclear stock-
piling behaviour, meant only for nuclear blackmailing. Deterrence 
was all that it aspired for and which it did achieve.
    
Pakistan's missile programme similarly was undertaken in the early 
1987, on the explicit information gained that India was on the road 
to pursue its missile as well as chemical weapons development 
programmes. Its authenticity was checked and rechecked. General Zia 
ul-Haq, who was the then president, in consultation with the 
concerned departments, took two crucial decisions. The first one 
was based on moral principles that Pakistan would not develop 
chemical weapons. The second one was to build missiles of short and 
medium range capabilities, and also to be equipped with propel 
guidance systems.
    
The name Hatf for the missile was selected by the GHQ R&D 
Committee, as it was the name of the lance of the Holy Prophet 
(Peace be upon him), which was used in many Ghazvas, and had the 
unique distinction of never missing its target. Similarly the name 
Anza (a lance of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) was selected for a similar 
consideration, for the shoulder-fired ground -to-air missile, which 
was also developed during the same period.
    
No scientific weapon is perfected in one single trial. There is 
always a sustained journey towards gaining sophistication and 
precision. Thus efforts to improve Hatf-I continued and Hatf-ll, 
with a range of 250 KM with a payload of 500 KG was produced in 
1989. This was also a free flight rocket, with an inertial guidance 
system. It was displayed at the Pakistan Day parade of March 23, 

1990 and 1991.
    
Hatf III was a major breakthrough, which had 600 KM range and a 
payload of 500 KG, and a proper terminal guidance system, with 
accuracy of 0.1 per cent, as the circular error probability (CEP), 
at 600 KM range. The main features of this missile were that, it 
was a two stage rocket; war-head separation; a terminal guidance 
system and five different varieties of warheads. The most difficult 
part of the missile was its guidance system, which was developed 
with the help of Pakistani engineers and scientists working in 
Pakistan and abroad. This is the story till August 1991. 
Subsequently what happened to our missile programme, I have no 
definite knowledge. There was no news on the missile front from 
1991 to 1995, giving rise to suspicions and doubts that the 
programme was perhaps frozen under some compulsions best known to 
the two governments  1991-93 (Nawaz Sharif) and 1993-95 (Benazir 
Bhutto). Some future historian will perhaps unearth why the missile 
programme remained in animated suspense for the period 1991 to 
1995.
    
India went with frenzy, under a well planned integrated missile 
development programme (IMDP) to produce surface-to- surface Prithvi 
and Agni; sea-launched ballistic missile, surface-to-air Akash and 
Trishul; and anti-tank missile Nag. These were systematic attempts 
and planned psychological operations to overawe not only the 
neighbours but also to impress upon the developed world, the 
invincibility of its military might due to the state-of-the-art 
technology weapons it had acquired in its arsenal. Just as the 
dropping of the nuclear bomb in 1945 at Hiroshima was intended to 
bring Japan to a point of surrender, while indirectly it also 
communicated to the US potential adversary USSR, which after the 
end of the World War II would have been much too demanding.
    
It was in 1995 when India test-fired Agni missile and Prithvi was 
integrated as an operational weapon and the Government of Pakistan 
woke up from deep slumber and tasked Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan to 
develop a credible counter to Prithvi. In a short span of three 
years, his team accomplished a remarkable feat, just as he had done 
earlier in 1990 and '91, when he gave to the Pakistan army,, 
shoulder-fired groundto-air missile, Anza and the anti-tank 
Baktarshikan, both having state of the art missile technology.
    
There is however, an unfortunate tendency reflective of our psyche 
that we tend to remain personality-oriented and look for heroes in 
every sphere of our national life. It is time that we strengthen 
our institutions, which collectively achieve such results and take 
pride in them rather than build or demolish individuals at the 
altar of political expediency. General Jehangir Karamat rightly 
cautioned that the Missile achievement could not be attributed to 
any individual's toil. Ghauri is a result of a series of 
experiments and testings by our scientists and technical experts 
and the effort was spread over several years. From free flight 
missiles to a state of the art guided missile system, required 
innovative minds and dedicated souls, of which there is no dearth 
in Pakistan.
    
It was indeed a commendable strategic political vision that, the 
nuclear programme was initiated by late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1975 
and pursued by General Zia-ul-Haq, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Benazir 
Bhutto as well as Nawaz Sharif. There has been a commitment and 
continuity, despite political upheavals and strong antipathies 
against each other. And as a result of' continuity of the policy 
decision, our nuclear programme achieved the desired level of 
progress in early 1989, when the (PNCA) took the unilateral 
decision to restrain the programme, because the objectives of the 
programme had been served, ie a low level, non-weaponized 
deterrence against India was achieved, and there was no 
justification in stock-piling the fissionable material. In so 
doing, the programme was neither frozen, nor capped, nor rolled 
back. Only the level of the enriched uranium was brought down below 
five' per cent I
    
Consensus on core national issues has, therefore, lent power and 
resilience to Pakistan. There is a need to harmonize policy making 
with appropriate implementational strategies, and above all, with 
continuity, irrespective of which government is saddled into power.
    
The euphoria in the nation on the launching of Ghauri, is no doubt 
a bit exaggerated, as restrained expression of emotion is a mark of 
maturity of a nation. Moreover, ours is only a defensive 
orientation. In India, the jubilation was in direct proportion to 
its jingoistic designs and hegemonic aspirations. Our message 
across the border should be that the response to Ghauri does not 
warrant further escalation of their efforts. The insight must dawn 
that missile race will only go to accentuate regional 
impoverishment and deprivations. Ghauri is essentially a message of 
hope and for building a new paradigm for peace and cooperation and 
to stabilize the region.  Ghauri also has a message to all such 
diffident intellectuals in Pakistan notwithstanding some of our 
senior retired military minds who are counselling that in view of 
India's superiority in missiles and other weapons, it is imperative 
for Pakistan to accept the ground realities and negotiate some sort 
of give-and-take on Kashmir.
    
Negotiate one must, but not out of the dread of the nuclear or the 
ballistic missiles. Pakistan has the capability to bring into 
effect missile equalizer just as it achieved the nuclear one.
    
On the reactions from Indian strategic thinkers, one can only say 
that it is within our expectations that they would say what they 
are saying. Denial of the credibility of Ghauri is a mechanism to 
bolster the bruised ego. When it is all that fictional, why so much 
of fuss about on the issue? Surely there are some grey areas in 
Ghauri, as it happens in all such inventions, but our scientists 
are quite capable of rectifying them and even improve upon its 
efficiency  its range and multiple guided systems. To attribute it 
as a gift of the Chinese or Koreans, is only an infantile way of 
facing the reality. Rocketry is not a new art to the Muslims. In 
his famous book, The Sun of Islam Dr. Hunke writes:
    
"While we are amazed by the breath-taking progress of modern rocket 
technology, it seldom occurs to us to whom we owe this invention. 
We Westerners do not like to think about its origin. An engineer 
from Damascus and his sons Abu Bakr, Ibrahim and Mohammad 
constructed seven large rocket machines, which Kublay Khan used to 
break China's last resistance."

WITCH-hunt is defined in the Chambers Dictionary as "the searching 
out of political opponents for exposure on grounds of alleged 
disloyalty to the state etc; any comparable hunting-down or 
persecution of a group or an individual alleged to be behaving in a 
dangerously heretical manner'.
    
Well, Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari have not been suspected of 
heresy yet, but political opponents to some they are. She is 
clearly the object of a witch-hunt.
    
Those who do not wish to see Benazir Bhutto have a third try at 
managing national destiny should be the most concerned about the 
witch-hunt now in progress. It is vindicating the lady's word. She 
is the subject of a media trial. She is being selectively targeted 
in what is presently more akin to persecution than prosecution. Her 
partymen are clobbered at the gates of the Parliament, even though 
they are members of its upper house. Not just she and her husband, 
but now some of their family and other friends and associates 
categorized as 'front men' have just had the allegedly vast 
reservoirs of their bank accounts frozen.
    
As the allegations are yet to be established, the proceedings are 
energized by what is yet but a matter of opinion or undisclosed 
proof. One should then concede the right to differ and allow for a 
margin of error. It would be reassuring if matters were conducted 
within more familiar or less shadowy concepts of what constitutes 
crime, guilt and punishment. But Ehtesab is self-confessedly 
special and it evolves. The principle is not always of the fittest.
    
Does the end justify the means? Conventional wisdom was/is that Ms 
Bhutto and her husband and their cronies plundered the wealth that 
should have been the nation's or frittered away national interests 
to line their pockets. This is a country bordering on bankruptcy 
and any such loot should be confiscated and brought back.
    
It depends really on what we understand about the rule of law and 
expect from it and what our priorities are.
    
We need a civilized polity and it would be a pity to see the common 
protection the law of the land and its processes should confer 
impartially on every citizen alike diminished generally simply to 
facilitate nabbing Ms Bhutto. Yet this is what is happening. Many 
prejudge her as guilty and think it a shame to let her get away 
with it (like so many others who go scot-free).
    
But more is lost in the wider perspective by blending the 
principles of common justice with expediency than by living with 
the inbuilt constraints that mechanisms for justice may require. It 
is necessary for justice to remain blind even if agonized 
spectators can foresee a stumble. If we improvise specific 
treatment for those we are persuaded are guilty eventually we 
cannot hope to find an even-handed justice intact for ourselves.
    
Events in and around the Supreme Court have themselves provided the 
parable for us.
    
Turning to the specifics of incompetence and even venality in prime 
ministers: The urgency for probity and competence in a prime 
minister and that individual's family and associates is always more 
intensely apprehended in terms of today and tomorrow than 
yesterday. Ordinary Pakistanis today think oftener in terms of Mr 
Nawaz Sharif's past or Mr Saifur Rahman's past than Ms Bhutto's or 
Naheed Khan's.
    
Present-style Ehtesab may even bring back millions or is it 
billions? After a brief hurray people will return to wondering why 
motorways and airports come first. Or criticizing the latest 
equivalent of something like inducting highly-paid outsiders to revamp
government organizations and then not allowing proposed 
action.
    
Public figures inevitably live in glass houses and the old adage 
advises them not to throw stones. But Mr Sharif is a modern 
industrialist who knows that glass has some different properties 
now. It can be see-through one way and opaque the other, and it may 
be unbreakable. I is possible to nestle up quite comfortably in 
that kind of glasshouse and pelt away. But when residents remain 
impervious within a glasshouse that condition generates its own 
dangers.
    
The bias in Ehtesab is repugnantly apparent to almost everyone 
except those conducting it. It has effectively neutralized the 
weight of its own findings.

<a name="xxvi">XXVII NATIONAL GAMES GRIND TO A CONCLUSION</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Frenandez

PESHAWAR, April 27: The XXVII National Games were declared closed 
by Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif at a ceremony held with 
pomp and pageantry at the Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan Stadium here on 
Monday evening.
    
The three-hour concluding programme was watched with great fervour 
and enthusiasm by the 15,000-strong packed-to capacity terraces.
    
The Prime Minister arrived spot on time and was greeted by the 
Pakistan Army trumpeters and the melodic sound of bugles.
    
The chief guest was then introduced to the members of the 
organising committee. Soon after, there was pin drop silence as all 
present stood to attention while the National Anthem was played.
    
Major (retd) Bajwa and two others then took off in a huge hot-air 
balloon and before clearing the arena showered confetti from atop 
as a mark of respect to the Prime Minister.
    
Immediately after the recitation from the Holy Quran, flower petals 
were dropped from a low flying ultra light aircraft piloted by 
Akhtar Munir Marwat and then the evening's events began in right 
earnest.
    
A march past comprising brass bands and bagpipers took place. Led 
by Ghulam Haider, the musicians were a combination of Pakistan 
Navy, Pakistan Army, Pakistan Air Force, Pakistan Police, Frontier 
Constabulary and the Frontier Corps.
It was followed by the first non-Olympic discipline Tug-of-War 
single league tussle between Pakistan Army and Pakistan WAPDA 
squads. Pakistan Army were easily able to defeat Pakistan WAPDA in 
two straight rounds to win the gold medal and retain their title. 
The silver was snapped up by Pakistan Railways and the bronze medal 
by Pakistan WAPDA.
    
But it was, the free fall para jumps from a height of 10,000 metres 
by the `Sea Eagles' of the Pakistan Navy direct into the centre of 
the stadium oval which attracted the attention and earned the 
applause of the spectators. A team of 11 skyjumpers headed by 
Commander Sarfraz Tariq took part in the event with perfection and 
without any unfortunate incident. Later they were all introduced by 
Vice Admiral Aziz Mirza to the Prime Minister.
    
Two athletics finals were staged this evening. The first was the 
1,500 metres final. Pakistan Army's Zulfiqar Ahmed who trailed 
fellow-soldier Sher Mohammad until the bend overtook the former in 
the last lap in the straight to sustain his challenge and in the 
gold medal after clocking three minutes, 51.38 seconds.
    
L.Nk. Sher Ahmed had to be content with the silver after getting 
past the finishing line in three minutes, 52.07 seconds, The bronze 
medal was clasped by host NWFP's Jalaluddin in a time of four 
minutes, 01.66 seconds.
    
In the 4X400 metres men's relay final, Pakistan WAPDA finished 
first by clocking three minutes, 13.81 seconds. Pakistan Army 
trailed in second in three minutes, 13.81 seconds, Pakistan Police 

took the third spot with a time of three minutes 14.22 seconds and 
Pakistan Navy were placed fourth after winding up in three minutes, 
18.79 seconds.
    
However, Pakistan WAPDA suffered the ignominy of being disqualified 
by the chief referee and subsequently lost the gold medal.
    
Pakistan Army managed to storm into the lead after the first leg, 
their second and third man ran a flawless race before providing the 
baton to anchorman Allah Ditta. The anchor sprinted at a terrific 
pace and Pakistan's WAPDA's Mohammad Rafiq made a vain bid to 
overtake the soldier and once around the bend and after drawing 
level, he elbowed and tugged the shirt of Allah Ditta.
    
Ditta almost lost his balance and nearly went spreadeagle like Mary 
Decker-Slaney went after Zola Budd dug a heel into her during the 
1984 Los Angeles Olympics. But somehow or the other, Ditta 
succeeded in staying up and was able to regain his composure. In 
the process, Mohammad Rafiq overtook Ditta at the 300-metre mark 
and although Allah Ditta made a last ditch effort to breast the 
tape, he failed to collar the former.
    
Pakistan WAPDA were disqualified because of foul play and the gold 
medal was  awarded to Pakistan Army. Pakistan Police were then 
elevated to the second position and Pakistan Navy to the third.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif prior to the finale awarded the `Fair 
Play Trophy' to NWFP. Mr. Mohammad Saeed Khan and Senator Aqil 
Shah, President and Secretary of the NWFP Olympic Association 
jointly received it on behalf of the province.
    
The overall `Athletics Trophy' was won by Pakistan Army and it was 
presented to Col. Mohammad Abrar, Manager of the Pakistan Army 
athletics team.
    
The runner-up  Syed Wajid Ali Shah trophy  went to Pakistan 
WAPDA.
    
The Quaid-i-Azam Trophy for the contingent which amassed the most 
number of points was whisked away by Pakistan Army for the 12 
consecutive year. Mr. Nawaz Sharif presented it to Brig. Abid 
Zubaidullah, Chairman Pakistan Army Sports Directorate.
    
The winning athletes were also garlanded with their medals by the 
Prime Minister.
The President of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA), Syed Wajid 
Ali Shah, then invited Mr. Nawaz Sharif to declare the Games 
closed.
    
The Prime Minister before doing so, said being a sportsman himself, 
he would always be available for sports function and if Syed Wajid 
Ali Shah invites him for the closing ceremonies of National Games 
as long as he is in office, he would oblige him at all cost.

<a name="thed">The demoralising 90-day African safari</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

DISAPPOINTING is perhaps the mildest word to describe our 
cricketers performance on the African safari.
    
The one-all draw in the three-Test series against South Africa may 
appear quite respectable, but the events of the lost third Test at 
Port Elizabeth more than neutralised the marvellous and historic 
win at Durban in the second Test.
    
The tour of Zimbabwe, which was being taken lightly and sort of 
breathing time, unexpectedly went full length, notwithstanding the 
fact that Pakistan won the two-Test series 1-0 and the one-day 
series 2-0 after a bumpy ride.
    
The most demoralising part of the 90-day tour was when Pakistan 
returned to South Africa for the tri-nation series and lost four 
out of the six league matches and were lucky indeed to qualify for 
the final in which they touched the rock bottom.
    
There is no denying the fact that injuries to Aamir Sohail, Saqlain 
Mushtaq and Shoaib Akhtar weakened the team. There were several 
tactical errors too and these went unnoticed and denied Pakistan an 
opportunity to win the Test series against South Africa, register a 
more convincing performance against Zimbabwe, and put up a 
respectable show in the triangular series.

To begin with, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) made the mistake of 
appointing Rashid Latif as captain, whose career now seems in 
jeopardy. Latif had played just eight one-dayers in 19 months, 
lacked fitness and form, when the daunting task of leading the team 
was imposed on him.
    
Latif's appointment as captain also unbalanced the side. The defeat 
at Port Elizabeth is a case in point. Two wicketkeepers (Latif and 
Moin Khan) played together for the first time as Pakistan went into 
the Test with four specialist stroke-makers excluding Moin who was 
included as a batsman, a role he was not accustomed to. Needing 
just a draw to clinch the series, Latif should have been wise 
enough to delay his inclusion in the team until Zimbabwe to allow 
Pakistan to field five specialist batsmen excluding Moin who would 
have retained his place as wicketkeeper-batsman, a role he had 
performed creditably throughout.
    
Although the belated inclusion of Wasim Akram in the team and 
prompt selection for the Port Elizabeth Test was also debatable as 
the allrounder had played just one first-class match in three 
months, he more than proved his class in the first phase of the 
tour.
    
Akram's inclusion seemed to have affected the cohesion and 
understanding of the outfit. A team which looked tenacious at 
Durban, was in tatters at Port Elizabeth. The implication of this 
about-turn must be duly pondered.
    
Shahid Afridi, who had been opening the innings in the absence of 
Aamir Sohail, was played in just three games. Yousuf Yohana and 
Mohammad Wasim, both quite successful in Zimbabwe, were denied 
their rightful place for an out-of-form Ijaz Ahmad.
    
The otherwise disastrous tour has a few positive points also, 
mainly, the much needed exposure to youngsters. Mohammad Wasim and 
Yousuf Yohana exhibited their temperament and skills with the 
willow. Azhar Mahmood and Abdul Razzak emerged as allrounders with 
a bright future, and Shoaib Akhtar impressed with his speed. 
Unfortunately there is no one in the team like Imran Khan to polish 
the crop of fast bowlers.
