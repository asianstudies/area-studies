<a name="usde">US defends arms supply by China to Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, June 5: The White House, Pentagon and the State 
Department on Thursday defended the supply of conventional arms to 
Pakistan by China, saying these are designed to help Pakistan 
defend itself and they were not covered by MTCR.
    
"We don't regard that as a dangerous act of proliferation. These 
are designed to help Pakistan protect its own forces against tank 
attack. In fact, in the past, the United States has sold anti-tank 
missiles to Pakistan as well," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon 
told the regular news briefing.
    
He was asked to comment on reports that a Chinese ship with anti-
tank missiles had been tracked by US intelligence and was on high 
seas heading for Karachi.
    
Other spokesmen of the Clinton administration dismissed the report 
of the Chinese ship as unimportant.
    
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: "I am not aware that there 
are any current allegations that the Chinese are transferring 
technologies that would be restricted by any of the export control 
guidelines that we have agreed..."
    
"There are technology transfers that occur. I mean they are 
involved in commerce in goods and services and technologies, just 
as we are," McCurry said dismissing the reports.
    
State Department spokesman James Foley also did not attach any 
seriousness to the reports.
    
"On the question of anti-tank missiles, they are short range 

defensive and conventional weapons and they do not represent a 
proliferation threat," Foley said. "They are not covered by the 
MTCR."
    
Bacon said: "I can't comment, obviously, on specific intelligence 
matters. The story pointed out, after the first paragraph, that 
this seemed to be bearing anti-tank missiles, and we know that 
China has had a long supply relationship with Pakistan, supplying 
anti-tank missiles. We don't regard that as a dangerous act of 
proliferation. These are designed to help Pakistan protect its own 
forces against tank attack. In fact, in the past, the United States 
has sold anti-tank missiles to Pakistan as well."
    
Bacon was asked about the Indian claims that its primary concern 
was China as far as their nuclear development is concerned. So 
apparently China and India think that they are each other's rivals 
in this nuclear matter. Does the United States see it that way? And 
why is this country so silent about China's role in the nuclear 
matters in the Indian subcontinent?
    
He said: "First of all, in answer to your first question, I think 
I'll let the Chinese and Indian officials you quoted speak for 
themselves. I think they are probably better able to assess their 
own security concerns than I am.

<a name="ince">Incentive offered to forex account holders</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 5: The Economic Policy Committee of the Cabinet 
(EPCC) has decided to provide additional incentives to the holders 
of foreign currency accounts, both residents or non-residents, if 
they convert them into rupees before Sept 1.
    
The EPCC which met here on Thursday and Friday decided to exempt 
such foreign currency account holders from probe by tax 
authorities. They will enjoy exemption from wealth tax for six 
years and the interest or profit earned on the dollar accounts 
before conversion would be exempted from income tax. Moreover, the 
accounts will enjoy banking confidentiality. About exemptions from 
wealth tax, the CBR would shortly announce details.
    
It was also decided by the EPCC that foreign currency deposits 
having specified maturities which extended beyond August 31, could 
also be covered into rupees on any earlier date. In such a case, 
the depositor will receive a lower profit according to established 
banking practice.
    
The State Bank has already clarified that the foreign currency 
deposits maintained by diplomatic missions accredited to Pakistan, 
their non-resident employees, all international organisations in 
Pakistan including all UN agencies, IMF, IBRD, Asian Development 
Bank and their non resident employees will not be affected by the 
recent restrictions. There were some other categories in which 
there was either a contractual obligation or where the SBP would 
otherwise have allowed opening of foreign currency accounts. SBP 
will be considering applications regarding this on a case-to- case 
basis. Such applicants may approach the SBP with relevant facts.
    
The committee was informed that banks were making arrangements to 
offer alternatives to investment in rupee account of short and 
medium-term duration in which the depositors can earn attractive 
returns. In addition, various saving schemes like National Defence 
Certificates offer attractive tax free returns to depositors. As 
such all those who convert their dollars into local currency and 
place them in rupee accounts or saving schemes will be earning 
handsome returns.
    
Arrangements are being made to ensure that credit cards issued by 
banks can continue to be used outside Pakistan. In this regard 
appropriate instructions are being issued by the SBP to all banks.
    
Deposits in foreign currency under the National Debt Retirement 
Programme will continue to be received, in accordance with the 
original programme.

<a name="paki">Pakistan tests sixth N-device</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, May 30: Pakistan carried out its sixth nuclear test on 
Saturday and said it had completed the "current series of nuclear 
tests". Islamabad also offered to hold talks to prevent the 
"dangers of nuclear conflagration".
    
Announcing the tests at a news conference here in the afternoon, 
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said all the tests were fully 
contained and there was no release of radioactivity. He added that 
the tested devices corresponded to weapons configuration compatible 
with delivery systems, but did not elaborate.
    
The foreign secretary confirmed that some air attacks were feared 
on the country's nuclear installations after the Indian nuclear 
tests, but he said he had no report of any such attempt by Israel.
    
Mr Shamshad said the nuclear tests provided Pakistan with a nuclear 
deterrence. "It will be used entirely for self-defence. We have no 
intention to enter into an arms race in the region".
    
Reading from a prepared statement, the foreign secretary said "the 
history of the Cold War era shows that such disastrous races are 
counterproductive and definitely not sustainable", particularly 
since over one billion people of the region did not want, and 
certainly cannot afford to divert, precious resources for a nuclear 
confrontation in South Asia.
    
The foreign secretary emphasized that only one test was carried out 
on Saturday, contradicting earlier reports that two tests had been 
conducted. He also denied that any missile tests had been 
undertaken since the Ghauri test last month.
    
He said Pakistan's nuclear programme did not seek any superiority 
over India's and pointed out that nuclear tests were meant to 
establish the nation's nuclear deterrence against aggression.
    
He said Pakistan resorted to nuclear option as a reaction to 
India's nuclear tests, and emphasized that in doing so Pakistan 
gave only a "bare minimum response" to restore strategic balance.
    
Answering questions about Pakistan's stand on the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test Ban (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 

(NPT), Mr Shamshad Ahmad said the issue was being evaluated in the 
context of "new realities" pertaining to the regional security 
environment, especially the Indian threats to invade Azad Kashmir 
shortly after carrying out nuclear tests at Pokhran.
    
"History tells us that non-proliferation cannot be ensured in a 
security void and a global security order cannot be predicated in 
trying to freeze inequities and ignoring injustices," Shamshad 
said. But the issue must be discussed with major world powers 
first, he added.

<a name="f16i">F-16 intruded Pakistan air space, says report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

LONDON, June 3: An unidentified F-16 warplane had intruded 
Pakistan's airspace on reconnaissance mission hours before Pakistan 
conducted its nuclear tests raising fears among Pakistani officials 
that Israel might attempt to air attack on its nuclear 
installations, The Times newspaper said on Wednesday quoting 
Israeli and Western officials.
    
Quoting these un-named officials, The Times said that Pakistani 
ministers concluded that Israel and India were in league to attack 
its nuclear facilities in the same way that Israeli jets destroyed 
Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 raid.
    
Quoting Israeli media, the paper said that Pakistan's anxiety arose 
after an F16 was twice reported to have been spotted in its 
airspace.
    
"It was assumed to be Israeli, because India does not have F-16s, 
but part of a force cooperating with India to launch a pre-emptive 
strike last Thursday, Pakistan made preparations to counter an air-
strike and its missiles were put on high alert," the paper said.
    
Quoting state-run Israeli television, the paper said that Pakistan 
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan had informed the United Nations 
and the United States hours before the first of its five tests last 
Thursday that Israeli jets were about to attack.
    
It said that Israel used a variety of diplomatic channels to 
reassure Pakistan that it was not preparing any form of military 
attack.
    
The paper said Pakistan suspected that Israeli jets were using 
Indian bases. "However, Western defence experts did not rule out 
the possibility that Israeli reconnaissance aircraft could have 
flown from a home base to Pakistan, using mid-air refuelling, 
without being seen by radar along the route," the paper said.
    
It recalled that eight Israeli bombers had flew below the radar 
level across Jordan and Saudi Arabia in 1981 when it conducted air 
strike against Iraqi installations.
The paper said that now Saudi Arabia has low-level radar systems 
and Israel would be unlikely to risk the overland route. "The 
alternative route would be to fly at low level out of Eilat down 
the Red Sea, with mid-air refuelling half way, then across the 
Arabian Sea before reaching Pakistan."
    
The Times quoted Paul Beaver of Jane's Information Group as saying 
that the Israeli Air Force two-seater F-16 had been equipped with 

an advanced reconnaissance system which at 45,000 feet could take 
photographs of targets 50 miles away. The equipment is so 
sophisticated that it could read the lettering on the side of a 
truck parked at a Pakistani nuclear facility, he said.

<a name="bidt">Bid to meet sanctions: Spending cut by half</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report 

ISLAMABAD, May 30: The National Economic Council (NEC) - the 
highest body on economic decision-making - on Saturday decided to 
make a 50 per cent cut on all expenditures, except for those on 
development and the salary component.
    
"The prime minister, who chaired the NEC meeting here on Saturday, 
says that let there be a real austerity so that the nation could 
effectively meet the new challenges", said Finance Minister Sartaj 
Aziz after the meeting.
    
He told newsmen that the NEC discussed the post-sanctions situation 
and agreed with the prime minister that there should be a 50 per 
cent cut in expenditure.
    
Mr Sartaj Aziz said there would be a review of allowances and other 
facilities in order to effect a substantial reduction.
    
He said except for salary and development expenditure, there would 
be a serious cut in expenditures on telephone calls, stationery, 
fuel and maintenance of dual offices. "That is the only way we can 
achieve self-reliance", the finance minister said.
    
Responding to a question, he said the Rs 110 billion Public Sector 
Development Programme (PSDP), approved by the Annual Plan 
Coordination Committee (APCC), now might have some changes.
    
To another question, the finance minister said the prime minister 
told his cabinet colleagues that hard times were ahead for which 
the whole nation seemed ready to extend full cooperation to the 
government.
    
"No doubt there will be a paucity of resources and this situation 
will be faced by reducing our unnecessary expenditure", Senator 
Sartaj Aziz said.

<a name="punj">Punjab sugar mills final bidding on 9th</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

LAHORE, June 1: Prospective buyers of Kamalia and Pattoki sugar 
mills will have to pay Rs40 per share and Rs41 per share, 
respectively, to return the mills' loans as well as to contribute 
50 per cent to the 'golden handshake fund' to pay off employees in 
addition to the purchase price.
    
The two mills  owned by the Punjab Industrial Development Board  
are being sold by the provincial government to the private sector 
through the Punjab Privatization Board (PPB). The pre-bidding 
conference for the interested investors is being held on Tuesday 
while the final bids will open on June 9.
    
PPB chairman Tariq Hameed told reporters on Monday that the PIDB 
had lent Rs 175 million to Kamalia sugar mill and Rs157.5 million 
to Pattoki sugar mill which would be repaid by the prospective 
buyers. 
    
Furthermore, he said, the buyers would also have to pay half of 
Rs65 million to pay off 1,131 employees of Kamalia sugar mill and 
half of Rs90 million to pay off 1,350 employees of Pattoki sugar 
mill. He made it clear that these payments will be in addition to 
the purchase price to be offered by the buyers.
    
Hameed said the PIDB had also decided to retain the current sugar 
stocks of the two mills to pay growers. Besides, the short-term 
bank loans taken by the PIDB to partly pay the growers would also 
be returned from the sale of the sugar stocks.
    
At present, Kamalia sugar mills has a stock worth Rs570 million and 
liabilities of Rs260 million in the form of payments to be made to 
the growers and Rs210 million in the shape of bank borrowings. 
Similarly, Pattoki sugar mill has a stock worth Rs440 million 
against its liabilities of Rs150 million to be paid to the growers 
and Rs240 million to return the bank borrowings.

<a name="didi">Pakistan did it in self- defence: Zaki</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent
    
UNITED NATIONS, MAY 30: Comparing India with Nazi Germany, the 
chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Akram Zaki, said on 
Friday Pakistan had no choice but to conduct nuclear tests to 
restore the military balance upset by India.
    
Addressing a press conference at the United Nations Correspondents 
Club, he declared that India was eyeing the wealth of the Arab 
nations, suggesting that New Delhi wanted to hold sway over them.
    
Mr Zaki is heading a two- man delegation to the United States to 
explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear explosions. Ghulam 
Sarwar Cheema, chairman of the National Assembly's Defence 
Committee is also a member of the team.
    
Mr Zaki said: 'I have had a very unhappy feeling that India in the 
'90s was pursuing virtually the same approach which the Nazi 
Germany pursued in the'30s."
    
"Like the Nazi Germany of the'30s, India has expansionist 
ambitions. And like the Nazi Germany, it is pursuing an armament 
programme, including a nuclear one," he added.
    
" Its eyes are not only on Pakistan, but also on the wealth of the 
Middle East. And it considers Pakistan the main obstacle to its 
expansionist designs,"said Mr Zaki.
    
"Just as the Soviet southward expansion was stopped by Pakistan, 
acting as a shield; if India's expansionism has to be stopped, it 
has to be stopped now, with Pakistan acting as a shield," he said. 
Zaki.
    
Mr Zaki said that after India exploded its five nuclear devices on 
May 11 and 13, it started threatening Pakistan, with various 
ministers making " irresponsible statements." " With these 
provocations and India's nuclear explosions, the psychological and 
the military balance had changed. And it was absolutely essential 
to restore this balance," he added.
      
Mr Cheema, a retired army colonel and former minister of state for 
defense, told a questioner that " the nuclear weapon is essentially 
a political weapon. It is not meant to be used, except when it is 
in the hands of irresponsible nations."

<a name="budg">Budget on 13th: Tough options for government</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 4: Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz will be presenting 
the second budget of the PML government on June 13 in an atmosphere 
of escalating nuclear tensions in the region, threats of 
international sanctions and burgeoning economic difficulties 
shaping up into a default-like situation.
    
On the expenditure side there is not much that the finance minister 
can do to keep the size of the budget from going beyond that of 
current year's by at least 15 per cent as allocations for both 
defence and debt servicing are likely to go up by hefty margins.
    
On the income side, the finance minister is facing a certain cut in 
the foreign flows as concessional assistance is going to be 
seriously affected if the sanctions take effect while the 
availability of commercial loans would become too uncertain because 
of downgrading of the country's risk rating by some of 
international financial evaluators.
    
The government, therefore, has already assigned the Central Board 
of Revenue the task of collecting as much as Rs500 billion in taxes 
against the current year's target of Rs305 billion.
    
Before the nuclear tests, the CBR was given a target of about Rs355 
billion for the next year without proposing new taxes or increasing 
the rates of existing taxes except of course the introduction of 
general sales tax under which head the government had proposed to 
collect as much as Rs20 billion.
    
However, the new target for collection amounting to Rs500 billion 
is likely to envisage enhancement of import duties by at least 10-
15 per cent which is expected to bring in an additional income 
while at the same time keep the imports within control.
    
But, the fact that this would go against the IMF prescription is 
likely to influence the final decision on the matter because a 
government facing an extremely reduced foreign capital flows would 
not like to unilaterally repudiate an agreement from which flows of 
a billion dollars are expected over the next year.
    
The biggest problem that the finance minister faces is that of 
servicing the foreign debt over the next 12 months and keeping the 
essential imports flowing in at the same time.
    
He would need at least about three billion dollars to service the 
debt and another about 10 billion dollars for paying the bills for 
essential imports. Exports are expected to take care of at least 
about 8 billion dollars worth of imports. This would still leave a 
hefty amount of 5 billion dollars to be taken care of. It would be 
interesting to see how the finance minister proposes to grapple 
with this problem in his budget.

<a name="mass">Mass-scale production of Ghauri begins</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi
    
ISLAMABAD, May 31: The country's top nuclear scientist, Dr Abdul 
Qadeer Khan, said on Sunday that mass production of long-range 
Ghauri missile had begun at Kahuta laboratories.
    
Mr Khan, who is the architect of the country's nuclear programme, 
told newsmen that the Ghauri missiles, deployed on the eastern 
borders a night before the first phase of nuclear tests, had been 
withdrawn.
    
Dr Khan, however, did not confirm that missiles carried nuclear 
warheads. He simply said: "Who knows what type of weapons they were 
carrying."
    
When his attention was drawn to a statement of the Foreign Office 
that Ghauri missiles did not carry nuclear warheads, he said: "If 
the government says so then let us believe it's so." After all it 
was the responsibility of the government to take a decision on the 
security of the country, he added.
    
Confirming reports about an Indian plan to attack Pakistan's 
nuclear installations last Wednesday night, he said the government 
had received information from various quarters.
    
"The GHQ thought sometimes people, in ignorance, take irrational 
steps and somebody could put in the minds of Indians that if they 
would first strike Pakistan, it will not be able to carry out its 
tests," he said.
    
Therefore, he said, the government had put the army and moved some 
missiles for deployment.
    
Dr Khan, describing the "Pakistani bomb" as a "peace guarantor" 
said, "my efforts for the bomb were an effort to ensure security 
for the people of my country."
    
On the controversy going on between the Khan Research Laboratories 
and PAEC, he said the Kahuta research laboratories had been 
established to attain nuclear weapon capability. He said they had 
achieved that way back in 1984, and now when the time came for 
testing, the government decided that both KRL and PAEC should 
jointly work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, June 4: Agha Hamid Ali Shah Mausavi, chief of the 
Tehrik Nifaz Fiqh-i-Jafriya (TNFJ), has said that now when Pakistan 
has entered the nuclear club, western powers were bent upon 
punishing Pakistan through economic sanctions.
    
Speaking at the Mehfil-i-Musa ibne Jafar on the occasion of "Youm-
i-Noor" here on Wednesday, he said it was the duty of the Islamic 
world not to leave Pakistan alone in this hour of trial as all 
Muslims were like a body.
    
The Islamic world should keep in mind that these sanctions were not 
only against Pakistan but against the Islamic world. In the present 
circumstances, he said, Iranian offer to coope rate with Pakistan 
suggested that they felt the pinch of Pakistani pain and were still 
following the line of action given by Imam Khomeini.

Mausavi said if the Islamic world forged unity displaying courage 
and announced boycott of all Zionist and Indian goods then the 
economic sanctions imposed on Muslim states would become null.
    
He said the 50-year-long Pakistani character indicates that 
Pakistan always helped Palestine, Iran, Afghanistan Iraq, Sudan, 
Libya, Saudi Arabia, and African Muslim countries whenever it was 
required.
    
Terming the Iranian offer a good omen, he called upon other Muslim 
states to follow suit. He said the Pakistani nuclear tech nology 
ensured international peace.

<a name="swis">Swiss judge 'indicts agent' of Benazir, Asif Zardari</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick 

LONDON, June 2: An investigating magistrate in Geneva on Tuesday 
indicted Jens Schlegelmilch, an alleged agent of Senator Asif Ali 
Zardari and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Switzerland, 
and two officials of Cotecna and Societe Generale de Surveillance 
(SGS) companies appointed by PPP government for evaluation of 
imports and exports  on charges of corruption, payment of 
commissions and money laundering, a press release issued by a 
lawyer representing the government of Pakistan asserted on Tuesday. 
However, there was no official confirmation of the claim.
    
The press release issued by Jermey Carver, a senior lawyer 
representing the government of Pakistan in cases against Mr Zardari 
in the UK said, the investigating magistrate, Judge Daniel Devaud, 
also "confirmed his intention to proceed with indictment of Mr Asif 
Zardari."
    
"Regarding former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, he intends to 
proceed with her indictment after checking whether she benefits 
from immunity," the press release claimed.
    
Indictment means that the magistrate, after detailed investigations 
six months in this case  has sufficient evidence showing that 
crimes of corruption were committed, followed by money laundering 
of the proceeds in Switzerland. There is no appeal against the 
indictment.
    
The investigations were conducted on the request of the government 
of Pakistan and after preliminary inquiries, the attorney general 
in Geneva ordered that a criminal investigation be started. It was 
in the course of these criminal proceedings that the judge made 
these indictments.
Mr Schlegelmilch is a lawyer in Geneva and the sole agent of some 
20 offshore companies said to have been established by Mr Zardari 
in British Virgin Island and who also allegedly used to manage the 
accounts of these companies on behalf of Mr Zardari, Benazir Bhutto 
and Begum Nusrat Bhutto in Geneva. All alleged commissions and 
kickbacks by Cotecna and SGS were allegedly handled by Mr 
Schlegelmilch.
    
The judge has indicted Hans Fischer, a representative of SGS, who 
allegedly paid kickbacks to Mr Zardari's company, for money 
laundering. Similarly, the judge indicted Robert Massey, the 
managing director of Cotecna, who had been allegedly working in 
close collaboration with Mr Schlegelmilch, on the charge of money 
laundering.

<a name="8bid">8 bidders named for KESC sell-off</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, June 5: The Chairman of Privatization Commission (PC), 
Khawaja Asif announced on Friday the names of eight prospective 
bidders participating in privatization of Karachi Electric Supply 
Corporation.

Short listed from among 10 investors who showed keen interest in 
KESC privatisation by a panel comprising officials of PC, Ministry 
of Water and Power, KESC, and the Union Bank of Switzerland 
(Financial Advisor), Khawaja said they are (1) The Asea Brown 
Boveri (ABB) representing Army Welfare Trust which has teamed up 
with Deutsche Bank group (2) CMA Energy, USA (3) The Daewoo, Korea 
Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and Ansaldo (4) Marubeni, Japan 
(5) National Grid UK (6) Tractbel, Belgium (7) The UAE Offsets 
group and (8) Union Fenosa group Spain.

Addressing the press conference, the PC Chairman was accompanied by 
UBS executive Khawaja Iqbal Ahsan, Managing Director of KESC Kamal 
Afsar, Chief Controller of KESC Abdul Rauf Yousuf and Amjad 
Pervaiz, a PC consultant.

To a question, the UBS Executive indicated the completion of KESC 
privatization by October next but admitted frankly that the present 
situation is fraught with uncertainties and there could be delay 
for unforeseen reasons.

To another question, the PC Chairman said 26 per cent to 51 per 
cent shares of KESC would be divested depending on the decision of 
the prospective investor.

However, none of those who addressed press conference were clear 
whether divesting of KESC shares would be through negotiations with 
the prospective investor or through open bidding.

Calling KESC "a crumbling company," the PC Chairman informed 
newsmen that accumulated losses and total liabilities have not only 
wiped out the entire capital but converted it into negative equity 
and hence it was not possible to work out the valuation of per 
share.

Replying to another question, the UBS executive said the next step 
in privatization process is the technical assessment by a team of 
the prospective investor, financial restructuring and a close look 
at legal aspects particularly in respect of franchise licence.

He said the prospective investors would do their own due diligence 
on all these aspects and it may take up to three more weeks before 
the privatization enters the final and decisive stage.

He indicated that prospective investor would have to invest about 
250 to 300 million dollars to refurbish the distribution system 
which is in very bad shape.

Asked why KESC was being offered as a single entity to the 
investors instead of breaking it up into generation, transmission 
and distribution companies, he replied that transmission is a small 
faction while distribution is afflicted with multiple problems. The 
prospective investor would prefer to take entire company and would 

set up three divisions.

The PC Chairman said the prospective investors has sought 
confirmation from UBS on autonomy and independence of National 
Electric Power Regulation Authority (NEPRA).

The UBS and its associates, he said, reviewed the NEPRA Act and 
sought a clarification of NEPRA's independence in tariff and that 
comprehensive and well defined regulatory framework be set in 
place.

Another major recommendation is on rationalization of fuel prices, 
reductions in transmission and distribution losses and decreasing 
overhead costs to achieve operational efficiencies which can be 
passed onto consumers.

<a name="cbrc">CBR considering raise in sales tax rate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, June 5: The Central Board of Revenue is considering to 
set the standard (slab) sales tax rate for the next financial year 
at 15 per cent, raising it from the current 12.5 percent.
    
This increase in the rate is being proposed in view of the decrease 
in the rate of customs duty from the present highest of 40 per cent 
to 35 per cent, as undertaken in the light of the slab set by the 
World Trade Organization (WTO).
    
The 12.5 per cent flat (standard) ST rate set in the federal budget 
1997-98, is deemed insufficient to meet the tax revenue target 
following reduction in the customs duty rate in the 1997-98 federal 
budget to 45, 35, 25, 15 and 10 per cent.
    
The CBR sources said that an additional sum of Rs15 billion is 
being anticipated from the increased rate of sales tax, and this 
sum would be over and above the growth of about 10 per cent 
expected collection under this head, in the financial year 1998-99.
    
Initially, the CBR had been given a budgetary target of Rs70 
billion but with the increase in rate the ST collection in the 98-
99 financial year might touch the figure of Rs100 billion.
    
The CBR has a reduced target of ST collection of Rs57 billion to 
meet by the end of the current financial year. The revised target 
does not include a sum of Rs18 billion which was lost to the Fixed 
Tax Scheme, litigation over the claims of tax amounts by the 
corporate sector, less collection of about Rs1 billion on account 
of the retail tax after its target was reduced in the shape of 
Trade Enrolment Certificates from Rs3 billion to Rs2 billion) etc.
    
The total loss in customs duties now being finally estimated on 
account of rate reduction incorporated in the federal budget, has 
been that of Rs25 billion. To make good the loss, the first step by 
the ministry of finance is expected to be removal of scores of 
exemptions allowed in the last 15 months. This step would be 
simultaneous with the increase in rate of ST to be incorporated in 
the federal budget 1998-99. The other step to be taken for meeting 
the revenue gap in 1998-99 would be imposition of increased rate of 
duty on scores of items, which is being actually dreaded by the 
importers, in the wake of the financial emergency imposed by the 
federal government.

<a name="econ">Economic cost of the N-explosions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

NOW THAT Pakistan has exploded five nuclear devices and come on par 
with India what will be the kind of economic punishment 
administered to us by the Western leaders who counselled against 
the testing? Which of the states will apply the sanctions, what 
will be the range of instruments chosen, or exceptions made and how 
long will they be valid?
    
Will they, for example, come to an end if India and Pakistan signed 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
as the Western leaders have been wanting, before or after the five 
Indian and Pakistani tests? Pakistan on its part has been 
consistent in its stand it will sign the treaties the day India 
signed them. But India is now quibbling and says it will sign some 
parts of the CTBT and insist on renegotiating some parts of the 
treaty with the avowed aim of destroying the nuclear stockpiles of 
the five nuclear weapons states.
    
Unlike what is generally believed, Pakistan did not have total 
sanctions earlier since 1990 but only partial sanctions even from 
the US. While it suspended all military and economic aid and 
military sales it did not bar the World Bank, IMF and the Asian 
Development Bank from extending their assistance to Pakistan. And 
Japan which has emerged the largest aid-giver to Pakistan following 
the US withdrawal, did not impose any sanctions against Pakistan, 
but now it will, as the Prime Minister had indicated before and 
after Pakistan's explosions.
    
Britain and France will not apply sanctions against Pakistan. They 
said the same earlier about in response to the Indian explosions. 
Russia will not apply sanctions on India and its cooperation with 
Pakistan is very limited. Germany has now made it clear it will not 
apply sanctions against India or Pakistan. So Pakistan has some 
breathing space.
    
But when it comes to the US it will now vote against assistance by 
the World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank. Several other 
western countries may join it in the governing bodies of these 
multilateral aid institutions. The World Bank is now scheduled to 
give 750 million dollars, and the rest of the 1.6 billion dollar 
loans from the IMF after two trenches of 208 million and 180 
million dollar maybe frozen.
    
The aid of 1.8 billion dollars to be provided by the Asian 
Development Bank between now and the year 2000 may also be frozen.
    
The credit guarantee of 293 million dollars to be provided to 
Pakistan by the EXIMP Bank of the US will also be suspended. Along 
with that the OPIC guarantees for US investments in Pakistan will 
remain suspended as it was for long from 1990, and that will 
discourage US investment in Pakistan in a big way.
    
However US credit for import of wheat, and soyabean under the PL 
480 will continue. And that is helpful to Pakistan which has been 
importing 2 millions tonnes of wheat for some years along with 
limited quantities of soya bean oil.
    
What is certain now, as finance minister Sartaj Aziz has asserted 
after the explosions, that the over nine billion dollar aid in the 
pipeline on which Pakistan has been paying nominal interest be 
available to Pakistan. 
But the problem is most of the aid has been held up as the matching 
rupee funds are not available, and sometimes the projects are not 
ready. 
    
Pakistan has now to mobilise such rupees resources to be able to 
use these blocked funds. India too faces a similar situation with 
similar quantity of aid in the pipeline. 

Stopping of Japanese aid to the extent of 500 million dollars a 
year can be truly hurtful to Pakistan. That credit is cheap and 
made available on easy terms.
    
Will some of the Arab countries, particularly oil states, come up 
with large assistance? In recent years their assistance or loans 
have been small and they had now been hit hard by the fall in world 
oil prices by 40 per cent. Oil experts now say that oil prices 
would remain depressed for a few years because of over-production 
and fall in demand, particularly after the East Asian crisis began.
    
The fall in world oil prices is, indeed, very helpful to Pakistan 
and has reduced its oil import bill and the balance of payments 
deficit considerably and it has enabled the collection of large 
revenues as development surcharges which are in fact revenue 
surcharges.
    
China will continue to assist Pakistan to the extent possible as it 
holds India as the Primary culprit in the nuclear area. 
   
Indian leaders have held China's nuclear capability or nuclear 
threat as a major reason for exploding their five bombs on May 11 
and 13. But we have to manage its aaid really well, and 
productively, and not disappoint China in our methods of aid 
utilization.
    
When it comes to the US it is not loss of direct aid which we have 
not been getting sine 1990 which can be hurtful to Pakistan as much 
as the bar on US investment after the US emerged recently as the 
largest investor in Pakistan. 
    
Without the EXIMP credit, OPIC guarantees and general official 
approval of support for investment in Pakistan, the US investors 
will not be forthcoming.
    
And Pakistan has made things far worse in the foreign investment 
area by the manner it mindlessly entangled with the 21 Independent 
Power Producers and eventually by the outrageous manner our 
officials behaved with the staff of HUBCO recently.
    
Meanwhile Pakistan is trying to conserve the dollar deposits of 
Pakistanis in Pakistan which total 11 billion dollars by freezing 
those accounts promptly and saying the depositors could draw those 
amounts in rupees. 
   
Many depositors hold this a gross breach of trust, but the fact is 
if the depositors try to withdraw their funds, neither the banks 
nor the government, which has only $1,386 million foreign exchange 
reserves, has the money to spare. In fact, the banks gave the money 
to the government which used that up and has only over $1 billion 
in its reserves. Hence the prompt action.

<a name="inte">Inter-banks cheque clearance automated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, June 4: Inter-banks cheque clearance in Karachi has now 
become fully automated and computerized. Bankers say about 57,000 
to 60,000 cheques issued by all the 45 banks and their 700 branches 
operating in the city are being cleared every day through automated 
computerized system.
    
Automated cheque clearance system replaces the age-old practice of 
commercial banks' representatives gathering every morning at 
Clearing House of the State Bank, where cheques were manually 
handed over to the banks on which they were drawn by those who 
collected it. For those account holders, who deposited these 
cheques, it used to take two to three days to collect the amount.
    
"You should now get the payment of such inter-banks clearance 
cheques next day you deposit at your bank", Anwar Samad, a former 
senior executive of Habib Bank who was associated with the 
automatic cheques clearance project since 1995 informed Dawn.
    
After retirement, Anwar Samad is now a director of Automated 
Business Services (ABS). ABS has provided technical infrastructure 
to the National Institutional Felicitations Technologies (NIFT). 
NIFT is doing the job of inter-bank clearance and also inter-
branches cheques clearance.
    
"Not only cheques, but all payment instruments that include pay 
orders, demand drafts, dividend warrants are being processed and 
cleared through the automated system," he said.
    
Bankers say that the present system benefits their clients as they 
get prompt payment of the cheques or any other payment instruments 
drawn on banks other than where they have accounts.
    
The system is also reported to be proving a boon for the banks in 
terms of saving of manpower and expenditure on clearing of cheques.

<a name="rese">Reserves fall by $101m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, June 4: Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves fell by $101 
million to about $1.271 billion on May 30 from about $1.372 billion 
on May 23.
    
The State Bank said on Thursday Pakistan had approved foreign 
exchange reserves worth $873.8 million whereas its balances held 
abroad stood around $397.4 million on May 30. A week ago the two 
figures were quoted around $910.2 million and $461.6 million.
    
Bankers link the fall in the reserves to lesser inflow export 
proceeds and remittances and a stand-still in inflow of foreign 
currency swap funds vis-a-vis increased imports and outflow of 
funds on maturity.
They say had the government not closed banks on May 29 after 
conducting five nuclear tests on May 28 the reserves would have 
fallen drastically.
    
The government and the State Bank have taken a number of steps 
including a ban on withdrawals from foreign currency accounts to 

keep the reserves from falling. Bankers say the reserves position 
of the next week (May 31-June 6) would show how effective these 
measures are.

<a name="sanc">Sanctions increase business risks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

LAHORE, June 2: The international economic sanctions clamped on 
Pakistan after it carried out nuclear tests on Thursday appear to 
have increased both the business and financial risks for local 
corporate entities, Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA) said on 
Monday.
    
PACRA, however, said it was 'too early to determine the extent of 
risk enhancement of each rated entity because that depended on the impact
and duration of economic sanctions already imposed and those 
being contemplated'.
    
Moreover, PACRA said, it recognized the overall adverse impact of 
the changing economic scenario on the operating environment. 'This 
element will be duly factored into PACRA evaluation for all ratings 
currently under process.'
    
In reply to inquiries about PACRA's intentions to downgrade already 
notified ratings consequent to lowering of Pakistan's sovereign and 
foreign currency deposit ratings, its Managing Director Javed Masud 
said: "the PACRA ratings are domestic ratings, that is, local 
currency obligations. Therefore, these ratings do not take into 
account the potential transfer or convertibility risk which may 
exist for foreign currency obligations."
    
Therefore, he said, the rating downgrade as notified by Moody's did 
not necessarily impact on domestic ratings in the country as 
notified by PACRA from time to time.
    
PACRA does not intend to notify 'rating alert' across the board. 
However, it will continue to actively monitor the changing economic 
scenario, and where it feels that rating needs to be reviewed, such 
ratings would be put on 'rating alert' pending a formal review.

<a name="88mi">$88 million withdrawn from forex accounts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, June 2: A sum of $88 million is reported to have been 
drawn from the foreign exchange currency accounts during May 25 to 
May 28, banking circles reveal.
    
On May 28, the day when Pakistan blasted nuclear device in response 
to five nuclear explosions by India earlier on May 11 and 13, the 
government put a clamp on the foreign exchange accounts.
    
Banking circles say that a few senior bankers associated with the 
privatized, private and foreign banks anticipated the oncoming 
measures and informed their clients and obliged them by offering 
various outlets for drawing foreign exchange from their accounts.
    
Even on the day, May 28, after the government made midnight 
announcement to suspend operations of the foreign currency 
accounts, branches of a number of privatized, private and foreign 
banks remained open till early hours of Friday.
    
Banking circles name a prominent foreign bank in Pakistan that has 
branches in Lahore and Islamabad apart from Karachi which went out 
of the way to oblige its clients. This bank offers a variety of 
services and products to its clients in Pakistan which many others 
do not.
    
A privatized bank is also reported to have been involved and one of 
its branches in Karachi was seen functioning on May 28 and 29 
midnight by the State Bank inspectors. Another bank, a private bank 
is also reported to have obliged its clients till early hours of 
Friday in withdrawing foreign currencies from their accounts.
    
The Inspection Branch of State Bank is understood to have gathered 
all the facts.

<a name="sees">Punjab sees Rs8bn cut in next budget</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaukat Ali

LAHORE, June 2: The Punjab government believed to have undertaken 
drastic changes in the proposed provincial budget for the fiscal 
year 1998-99 under instructions from Islamabad, which wants all the 
provinces to reduce expenditure by about 50 per cent, informed 
sources said here on Tuesday.
    
The province's finance officials, hope to slash the non- 
development budget by around Rs8 billion. Similarly, the size of 
the Punjab's Annual Development Programme is being brought down by 
about Rs 550 million. Actual ADP size was said to be around Rs 10.3 
billion for 1998-99.
    
Only a few days ago the government had announced that it would not 
compromise on the development sector in its current austerity 
drive.
    
Sources close to the budget making process told Dawn that a fresh 
summary of the ADP break-up, showing cuts in the proposed 
development expenditures, had been prepared and would be discussed 
in the next provincial cabinet meeting to be held within a few 
days.
    
"Although the Public Sector Development Programme of the federal 
government has set aside Rs32 billion for the development sector of 
different provinces for 1998-99, projecting an increase of Rs6 
billion over the current financial year's allocation, there is 
hardly any net gain in economic terms for the federating units 
keeping in view the inflation rate. As such, the development sector 
is bound to suffer. A good number of new development schemes in the 
latest ADP proposals may be dropped as a result," sources at the 
Punjab finance department said.
    
The Punjab Planning and Development Board, which has been assigned 
with the task of re-structuring proposals for the next provincial 
budget by squeezing funds, is mapping out details for every 
department where savings are possible.
    
The government, sources said, might abolish some grade 20 and above 
posts, ban purchase of durable goods and uplifting of offices which 
in recent years had become an obsession with senior bureaucrats 
whenever they were transferred from one office to another.
    
Cutting down the number of new development schemes, according to 
sources, is a hard decision for the government to take as 
provincial legislators have been building pressure on the 
government to approve the schemes for their respective areas.
    
Till only two weeks ago the MPAs knew details of the new schemes 
about which they also took people of their respective 
constituencies into confidence. But the new situation may cause 
embarrassment for them, they added.
    
Nonetheless, as the summary indicates, the government will spend 
around Rs8.5 billion on the new development schemes and the rest 
will be utilized on the on-going projects.
    
"The government, despite the odd situation, is however determined 
not to compromise on building roads and bridges linking major 
Punjab cities for this is the area which has long been neglected 
and hampered the province's development", sources pointed out 
saying that about 20 per cent of the total development budget would 
be spent on infrastructure development during the next fiscal year.
    
Under the new instructions, each and every provincial government 
department is making adjustments in their allocation of resources 
in close coordination with the Punjab Planning and Development 
Board.

<a name="move">Move to end dollarization of economy?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, May 30: A midnight clamp-down on foreign currency accounts 
(on Thursday/Friday night in the wake of Pakistan's five nuclear 
explosions on May 28) under the umbrella of "emergency laws" has 
raised a very pertinent question.
    
"Is this the beginning of de-dollarization of the national 
economy"? The question is being raised because account holders have 
been denied payment in the foreign currency in which they had 
opened the accounts, but also because there is a restriction on 
opening up of new foreign currency accounts. "Is this the end of 
the scheme?".
    
This question, too, is also being raised in response to the strong 
comments made recently by the IMF and the World Bank against the 
foreign currency accounts.
    
None other than the CBR chairman, Moeenuddin Khan, in a meeting of 
Management Association of Pakistan recently held in Karachi, also 
made two candid observations on foreign currency accounts, which 
are sort of loud thinking of the decision-makers in Islamabad.
    
He had said the deposits amounting to about $11 billion are a 
liability on the government against the $1.3 billion reserve which 
is not a very enviable situation.
    
Almost $11 billion deposits in terms of local currency amounts to 
well over Rs500 billion and is equal to the size of Pakistan's 
annual budget, which is outside tax net and a source of creating 
distortion in the economy.
    
Contacts with a top executive of a leading multinational, local 
businessmen, a senior banker of nationalized bank and two 
executives of private banks to solicit their views showed that none 
was clear in their perception for the future.
    
All, however, agree that government's decision to stop foreign 
currency payment to depositors was practical and pragmatic. But no 

one foresees whether it would eventually lead to shrinking of this 
scheme or it is a stop gap arrangement to overcome the present 
uncertain situation.

<a name="50pc">50pc cut in expenditure impossible to apply</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, June 1: The provinces are finding it almost impossible to 
implement the decision of the National Economic Council of applying 
a 50 per cent cut on their current expenditure budgets.
    
The NEC, during its meeting last week in Islamabad with the prime 
minister in chair, decided to apply a 50 per cent cut across the 
board on non-development expenditure. However, the salaries and 
pensions are exempted from this cut.
    
Suffering heavy cuts in their share of fund from the Federal 
Divisible Pool for two consecutive years, the provinces had already 
slashed down considerably, their present expenditure in the current 
fiscal year. This forced cut, according to a well placed source in 
Sindh government, had rendered key services like education, 
healthcare, irrigation and agricultural extension services almost 
inoperative.
    
In Sindh, almost 50 per cent of the total budget is consumed by 
salaries and pensions. While 25 per cent goes for debt servicing to 
Islamabad and it is in the remaining 25 per cent that development 
and maintenance of existing stocks is taken up.
    
For example in current fiscal year Sindh expects to receive about 
Rs 26 billion by the end of this month, as its share in the pool. 
It is about Rs 6 billion less than Rs 32 billion promised at the 
beginning of the current fiscal year. The 1997 National Finance 
Commission award had projected a total transfer of Rs 39 billion.
    
In addition to Rs 26 billion, Sindh was expected to raise Rs 7.9 
billion from its taxes and non-tax revenues. Total revenue 
generation in Sindh is now expected to be Rs 7 billion.
    
Islamabad provided capital development loan of Rs 3.75 billion to 
finance the Annual Development Programme and Rs 2 billion for 
Tameer-e-Sindh Programme. Total development outlay in 1997-98 is 
estimated at over Rs 8 billion.
    
>From these total resources of about Rs 38.75 billion, a sum of Rs 
19.2 billion was spent on salaries of 448,000 employees and pension 
for the retired servants. A sum of Rs 10 billion was deducted at 
source to service Islamabad's loans which amount to about Rs 80 
billion. For financing development programme and to meet 
operational cost of various provincial services, Sindh government 
is understood to have borrowed more than Rs 3 billion from the 
State Bank this year.
    
For next fiscal year 1998-99, Sindh has been promised Rs 36 billion 
as against 1997 NFC award projection of Rs 42.5 billion. The 
province is also expected to take up a development work of Rs 3.9 
billion. The planners in Sindh have no idea whether Islamabad would 
provide loan to finance this development outlay or it would have to 
be generated by the provincial government. However, Islamabad has 
promised Rs 1 billion for Tameer-e-Sindh next fiscal year.
    
All the four provinces were forced to cut down heavily on their 
current expenditure in the current fiscal year of 1997-98. A high-
level meeting presided over by the Finance Minister, Sartaj Aziz in 
March this year had reviewed the provincial expenditure of all the 
four provinces during July 1997 to January 1998.
    
Punjab was found to have slashed down its expenditure by Rs 15.8 
billion. Its total expenditure budget was Rs 80.66 billion and its 
proportionate expenditure was Rs 47.05 billion but had spent only 
Rs 31.21 billion.
    
So was the case with Sindh which was forced to save Rs 5.24 billion 
as its expenditure was Rs 18.7 billion against budget estimate of 
Rs 23.94 billion. Balochistan too, cut down its expenditure by Rs 
1.96 billion and NWFP Rs 6.54 billion.
    
Now, the federal government wants all the four provinces to 
maintain same level of expenditure and has advised to take up 
modest scale development plans.

<a name="ksei">KSE index recovers 31.01 points on buying in Hub-Power</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, June 5: Leading shares came in for strong short-covering 
at the lower levels boosted apparently by strength of Hub-Power and 
PTCL.
    
The KSE 100-share index recovered 31.01 points at 1,087.51 as 
compared to 1,056.50 a day earlier, indicating that it might breach 
the barrier of 1,100 points when trading resumes on next Monday.
    
On technical grounds also the market needs a breather and that 
could be extended in the coming week, some dealers said.
    
"The recovery could be very slow and progressive as no one is ready 
to ride bandwagon without taking into consideration the external 
factor, notably after the nuclear tests carried by both Pakistan 
and India," they added.
    
The market advance was led by heavy buying in Hub-Power on news 
that the Supreme Court has modified interim order of the Lahore 
High Court confining it to only repatriation of profits and allowed 
WAPDA to pay Rs 845 million each month to it in addition to the 
energy cost.
    
"The uncertainty on the IPP tariff issue might not be over as the 
apex court order on Hub-Power petition seems to have allayed many 
fears entertained by foreign sponsors," some analysts said.
    
After opening at Rs 19.10, Hub-Power steadily advanced to hit the 
peak of Rs 23.50 after the news of apex court order on its petition 
reached the rings. Weekend profit-selling, however, brought it down 
to close at Rs 21.50, up Rs 2.40 on 8 million shares.
    
Other current favourites, notably PTCL and ICI Pakistan, followed 
it pushing the market in the plus column despite bearish 
predictions by some analysts.
    
"Whether or not the market sustains the weekend snap rally is 
anybody's guess but some analysts say the prime minister package 
could give it much-needed push."
    
They said an air of optimism prevailed in the rings ahead of prime 
minister's new agenda to meet the challenge of sanctions.
    
Although there could hardly be anything for the share business, as 
the agenda could lead to some more taxes to make up the shortfall 
of funds caused by an expected decline in the inflow of foreign 
aid, some brokers made anticipatory buying to sell at higher 
levels.
    
However, unlike previous sessions, speculative forces were not that 
active and mostly played safe keeping most of the options open for 
the next week.
    
Moreover, the weekend rally always paves the way for a sustained 
run-up next week as technically-inspired buying manifests itself in 
a bigger way, they added.
    
All the sectors, notably bank, energy, chemical and pharma, 
participated in the run-up and there are reasons to believe that 
their lower levels could attract any amount of technical buying 
provided there is no external bad news.
    
Big gainers were led by Capital Securities, Adamjee Insurance, Hub-
Power, Business Insurance, Fauji Fertilizer, Reckitt and Colman and 
PSO, which posted gains ranging from Rs 1.75 to Rs 7.
    
Losers were led by Telecard and Shell Pakistan, falling by Rs 3.50 
to Rs 11 on active selling, followed by Gadoon Textiles, Al-Faysal 
Bank, Mitchell's Fruits and Gul Ahmed Textiles.
    
Trading volume fell to 46 million shares from the previous 81 
million shares, while gainers outpaced losers by 51 to 37 with 29 
holding on to the last levels.
    
ICI Pakistan again topped the list of most actives, up 75 paisa on 
26.301 million shares, followed by Hub-Power, higher Rs 2.40 on 
8.181 million shares, PTCL, up 65 paisa on 3.223 million shares, 
FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, firm 80 paisa on 2.111 million shares, Al-
Ghazi Tractors, easy 50 paisa on 1.251 million shares, and Faysal 
Bank, up 45 paisa on 0.681 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by KESC, up 20 paisa on 0.881 
million shares, Southern Electric, firm 45 paisa on 0.412 million 
shares, Sui Southern, firm five paisa on 0.389 million shares, Sui 
Northern, steady also by five paisa on 0.336 million shares, Engro 
Chemical, higher 50 paisa on 0.268 million shares, and D.G. Khan 
Cement, unchanged on 0.259 million shares.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Bolan Casting was the only share which came 
in for trading on this counter and was quoted lower on 500 shares.

<a name="anth">Anthropoids</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee
    
THE anthropoids across the border measured our tails, and were 
happy to conclude that they were longer than their own. We 
anthropoids in turn measured their tails, and concluded that ours 
were shorter. Both are happy, and claim popular support for their 
findings.
    
The blame for where we now find ourselves lies squarely and fairly 
on us, the people, the overwhelming majority of whom accept meekly 
and mildly whatever is pushed down their throats by their leaders-
cum-rulers who laze around in Islamabad, robbing them, 
impoverishing them. But it is the people who elect these men and 
women, it is the people who elevate them to the pedestals upon 
which they perch.
    
We must try briefly for one moment to to be honest and ask 
ourselves two hypothetical questions:
    
Firstly, were all those who have been alternately in power and in 
the opposition since 1988 to be herded together in the National 
Assembly and in the Senate, and were God in His infinite wisdom, 
mellowed by His infinite mercy, to send down a bolt of lightning to 
blow up parliament building with them in it, would we, the people, 
be better or worse off?
    
Secondly, were the crimes and misdemeanours of all those in all the 
jails of Pakistan added together into one total sum, and were all 
the crimes and brigandage of those who have robbed, pillaged, 
misgoverned and maladministered us since 1988, and yet remain free, 
also added up into one total sum, which would outweigh the other? 
Which lot is it, in ratio to the crimes committed, who should 
rightly be incarcerated?
    
Back from hypothesis to the cold earth of the Motherland and to 
reality. We are bankrupt (here I plead with my editor not to use 
his blue pen and add 'almost' before bankrupt). We just cannot earn 
any more. Every vital utility costs more by the day. For years, not 
a cent of remunerative investment has come in apart from buns and 
burgers, pizzas, fried chickens, chips, colas, ice-cream  in 
short, junk  enabling foreigners to bring in one dollar and take 
out six.
    
It is fine to boast that we can eat grass, but then is there enough 
grass for the 140 millions to munch? Certainly not in any of our 
cities. There is not sufficient water to drink, let alone to grow 
grass. All that can save us is thrift. The poor man, the common 
man, knows Mr Micawber was right: "Annual income #20, annual 
expenditure #19. 19s. 6d., result happiness. Annual income #20, 
annual expenditure #20. 0s. 6d., result misery." The government 
must cut its spending, what it terms developmental as well as non-
developmental, and concentrate on providing potable water, and 
health care, and building schools.
On Friday night, on PTV, Spin Doctor Mushahid was shown outside the 
turreted and domed prime-ministerial secretariat informing us of 
the prime minister's "measured and mature" response to the 
emergency, his decision to shut this particular shop. Apart from 
the fact that this monstrosity should never have been built, and 
that Nawaz Sharif should never have moved in, he has now actually 
done the right thing, late though it may be. The next immediate 
step is to hand back to the bankrupt national airline the Boeing 
737 which he uses each weekend to go home to Model Town.
    
The financial crash was anticipated, and financial ordinances one 
can bear with. But there was no valid reason whatsoever to declare 
a State of Emergency and to suspend the fundamental rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution. The anthropoids over the other side 
did not deem this to be necessary. Why should we let them get the 
better of us and be one step ahead?

Having imposed the Emergency upon the country, under Article 232, 
the president has issued an order under Article 233(2) by which 
"the right to move any court, including a High Court and the 
Supreme Court for the enforcement of all the Fundamental Rights 
conferred by Chapter I of Part II of the Constitution, and all 
proceedings pending in any court which are for the enforcement of 
any of the said rights, shall remain suspended for the period 
during which the said proclamation is in force."
    
Suspended is Article 8, which holds laws inconsistent with or in 
derogation of fundamental rights to be void. Suspended are the 
fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 9, "No person shall be 
deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law"; 10, 
safeguards as to arrest and detention; 11, prohibition of slavery, 
forced labour and child labour; 12, protection against 
retrospective punishment; 13, protection against double jeopardy, 
i.e double punishment, and self-incrimination; 14, "the dignity of 
man and, subject to law, the privacy of home, shall be inviolable," 
and "no person shall be subjected to torture"; 15, freedom of 
movement, the right to reside and move about freely throughout 
Pakistan; 16, freedom of assembly; 17, freedom of association; 18, 
freedom of trade, business or profession, "every citizen shall have 
the right to enter upon any lawful profession or occupation, and to 
conduct any lawful trade or business"; 19, " . . the right to 
freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the 
press";  Also suspensed are Articles 20, "every citizen shall have 
the right to profess, practise and propogate his religion," and 
"shall have the right to establish, maintain and manage [his] 
religious institutions"; 21, safeguard against taxation for 
purposes of any particular religion; 22, "none will be required to 
receive religious instruction, or take part in any religious 
ceremony, or attend religious worship, if such instruction, 
ceremony or worship relates to a relgion other than his own" etc; 
23, "the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property in any part 
of Pakistan"; 24, deprivation of a citizen's property; 25, equality 
of citizens; 26, non-discrimination in resepct of access to public 
places; 27, safeguard against discrimination in services; 28, the 
right of every citizen to have a distinct language, script and 
culture and the right to preserve and promote the same.
    
As it is, much of the legislation enacted by Nawaz Sharif's 
government is anti-people and violative of human rights, and is 
under challenge before the superior courts. The courts have already 
struck down a significant part of the Anti-Terrorism Act and 
watered down the 14th Amendment. Now, the government, through the 
imposition of the Emergency, has protected all its unconstitutional 
legislation from judicial scrutiny. This is draconian. The 
suspension of fundamental rights is uncalled for.
"Niyet bud ast," as has already been written by the discerning. The 
inherent fascistic tendencies have now truly come to the fore. We 
cannot suffer a dictatorship, we do not want to live in a police 
state, we cannot allow ourselves to be dragged down any further. If 
this 'elected' government cannot govern as decreed by the 
Constitution, without suspending the costitutionally guaranteed 
fundamental rights, then it must admit its incompetence and go.
    
First things first: the people must agitate, must protest, whilst 
firmly remaining within the realms of law. Our fundamental rights 
must be restored to us. The prevailing conditions and the 
desperation of the government necessitate that we remain protected 
as guaranteed.

<a name="madn">Madness in May</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

THE 1965 Indo-Pakistan war threw up a number of jokes. My favourite 
was the one about the meeting between officers of the opposing 
armies on the ceasefire line in the immediate aftermath of the 
fighting:
   
The senior Indian officer, a Sikh, asked his Pakistani counterpart, 
an old friend who had been to Sandhurst with him: "Yaar, we 
Sardarjis are supposed to go mad at mid-day; but what happened to 
you guys?"
   
What, indeed? This rhetorical question is more relevant today in 
the wake of the tit-for-tat nuclear tests we conducted last week 
than it was nearly 33 years ago. With eyes wide open, we have 
stumbled into a trap out of which there seems no escape. The people 
who danced with joy in the streets of Pakistan's cities have little 
idea of the high price they will have to pay for their short-lived 
celebrations.
   
And let us make no mistake about it: it is the common man who will 
have to bear the brunt of the sweeping economic sanctions we face. 
When food grows scarce and prices shoot up, those who took the 
decision to push the button will still be able to afford all the 
luxuries they enjoy today, Nawaz Sharif's brave words 
notwithstanding. After all, his children have never shared the 
miserable existence that is the average Pakistani's lot, so why 
should they start now?
   
For the week preceding the tests, I had been travelling abroad. All 
the people I met expressed their disgust at India over its recent 
nuclear chest-thumping, and said how impressed they were with 
Pakistan's mature and measured  response. While agreeing, I crossed 
my fingers in my pockets. Then, I learned that, as I had feared, 
Pakistan had been unable to resist following India's bad example.
   
While I have been a proponent of the Internet, there are times I 
wish it did not exist. Normally, when I am abroad, I take enormous 
pleasure from the fact that I am out of reach of the Pakistani 
media, and hence out of  touch with the hurly-burly of our national 
affairs. But after the recent round of madness in South Asia, I 
must confess to reading the Internet edition of this newspaper 
every day, and getting more and more depressed.
   
The British and American newspapers have been full of hypocritical 
cant about how awful it was for the two poorest states in the world 
to waste billions on nuclear weapons, conveniently forgetting that 
these same countries had sold billions of dollars worth of 
conventional arms to India and Pakistan over the years. The message 
seemed to be that while it was OK for us to kill each other with 
guns supplied by them, it was immoral to develop weapons that might 
affect their comfortable lives. Also, no commentator said anything 
about Israel's surreptitious acquisition of nuclear weapons with 
Western help. So my opposition to our tests has nothing to do with 
international public opinion. Basically, we should make policies in 
our own best interests, but I refuse to believe that by blindly 
following India's example, we have in any way enhanced our 
security.
   
Over the years, Pakistan's policy-makers have stuck to a very 
narrow interpretation of security: for them, it has mostly been 
limited to the physical boundaries of the state. Far too often, 
ideologues have voiced concern for our spiritual security as well, 
citing the Internet and the satellite television broadcasts from 
India and the West as threats to our moral wellbeing. We tend to 
lose sight of the economic and social dimensions of security. If 
the country is confronted with fiscal meltdown  as it clearly is 
now  then surely our nuclear arsenal becomes an expensive 
irrelevance.
   
A major reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union was that in the 
final analysis, it could not keep up with the United States in 
military spending, and the strain of trying to match its 
adversary's high-tech weaponry finally became too much. The same 
dynamics appear to be propelling us to financial suicide. Before 
the tests, the finance ministry had projected our requirement for 
foreign assistance in the next budget at five billion dollars, and 
despite a good wheat harvest, we still need to import two million 
tons. By the end of the year, we will need around three billion 
dollars to service various foreign loans. If we default, no private 
bank will lend us a penny, no letters of credit will be opened for 
imports, and the rupee will be in free fall, much as the Indonesian 
rupiah has been in recent weeks.
   
To overcome this financial crisis, the government has announced a 
special fund to which overseas Pakistanis will be urged to 
contribute. Now why anybody in his right mind would wish to 
contribute a penny to such a dicey venture is beyond me. We have 
been informed that the government is going to launch an "austerity 
drive." Considering that nearly 90 per cent of the federal budget 
goes towards defence and debt servicing over which no civilian 
government has any control, it is hard to see where the government 
will save money from. As things stand, it is barely able to pay 
salaries, so it is difficult to imagine that these feeble measures 
will enable the government to meet the yawning gap between income 
and expenditure.
   
Had we not tested, we would still have been a nuclear power and we 
could have squeezed some financial and political gains by occupying 
the moral high ground, apart from isolating India. As it is, we 
have entered the dangerous and uncharted territory of an open 
nuclear stand-off in which there will be enormous pressure to go 
nuclear as soon as there is a perceived threat on the "use it or 
lose it" principle. True, India was the first to raise the stakes, 
but just because the revanchist, reactionary  BJP government in New 
Delhi behaves in this illogical manner  should not mean that we 
follow suit.
   
But now that we have done the macho thing and exploded half-a-dozen 
devices, what prevents us from unilaterally signing the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? Or do our leaders want to keep the 
option of more tests if India indulges in another round of 
explosions? Surely enough is enough. If we can negotiate an end to 
sanctions as the price for signing the CTBT and the NPT, we should 
be grown up enough to do so, and stop chanting the mantra of "India 
must sign first."

<a name="eati">Eating grass</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

DURING the World Cup 1996 in Australia, our High Commissioner 
Bashir Babar invited a few members of the Pakistan cricket team and 
me to lunch at a very posh Chinese restaurant that overlooked the 
Sydney Opera House. The view was breathtaking and the prices on the 
menu suggested that the restaurant was levying a surcharge for the 
view.
    
The first course of our lunch consisted of some finely shredded 
green vegetable that looked suspiciously like blades of grass. 
Wasim Akram who was seated next to me asked me what it was. I told 
him that it looked and tasted like grass. Wasim then announced to 
his team-mates in Punjabi that we were eating grass. Albeit, very 
expensive grass. Then again, driving from Adelaide to the Barossa 
Valley, I cam across a field of blue grass. So there is grass and 
grass, one which is served in expensive Chinese restaurants and the 
other kind on which horses and cows and even goats nibble. And now 
that we have exploded our nuclear devices, the test has come for 
those who were prepared to eat grass. But what kind of grass did 
they have in mind?
    
It is apparent that tough times lie ahead and once again the nation 
is being asked to make sacrifices. I have not the slightest doubt 
that the people will make any sacrifices asked but a majority of 
the people already have their backs to the wall and for them two 
square meals a day is something of a feast and you can't get blood 
out of a stone.
    
The sacrifices, therefore, will have to be made by the moneyed 
classes which includes the ruling elite. They will have to set a 
high personal example, not a token or symbolic example but one in 
thought, word and deed. Austerity will have to begin with them and 
it will not only have to be practised but seen to be practised.
    
The Prime Minister has made a promising beginning by vacating his 
opulent secretariat but a colossal sum of money has already been 
spent on its construction and its decoration. Still, the building 
can be put to some good use. It could be turned into a museum or 
converted into a hotel. But much more than this is required. This 
is a golden opportunity to dismantle the VIP culture. Some severe 
cost-cutting will have to be done in the establishment strength of 
leaders who have become accustomed to a life-style that is out of 
sync with these democratic and egalitarian times. Members of the 
national and provincial assemblies themselves should give up their 
perks and privileges. This will allow them also to get closer to 
their constituents and if their constituents don't have safe 
drinking water, they too should drink from the same tap as their 
constituents.
    
There should be a total ban on motorcades and one does not want to 
see a procession of cars with outriders and sirens wailing and 
traffic stopped whenever a VIP decides to move from point A to 
point B. This is a costly exercise but more than that it seems to 
be mocking the public, a show of grandeur that is one of the causes 
of alienation.
    
In Karachi, I would humbly suggest that generators in the offices 
and residences of the Governor, Chief Minister, Ministers, 
Secretaries of the Government and the Managing Director of KESC be 
removed so that when there is a power failure they are made to feel 
the heat. I think you will find that this will do wonders and the 
performance of the KESC would miraculously improve.
    
Austerity has to be meaningful, not cosmetic. And this is not the 
time for grandstanding, for a cascade of brave and fighting words 
but for re-shaping the contours of the social agenda. Perhaps, it 
should be called the human agenda. The people have come out four-
square behind the decision to go nuclear publicly. This has nothing 
to do with national pride as foreign commentators are claiming. It 
has to with national security.
    
The Indians having carried out their own tests should have left it 
at that. Instead, intoxicated by their supposed military machismo, 
the Indian leaders went on an orgy of bluff and bluster and 
provocation and intimidation. They have behaved like bully-boys, 
leaders of street gangs. They upped the ante and the build-up of 
their troops on the Line of Control, seemed poised to attack.
    
They gravely miscalculated the resolve of the Pakistan people. The 
world has not understood that Pakistan went nuclear as a measure of 
self-defence. Thus it cannot be equated with India. The 
condemnations that are coming from the world's capitals are first 
reactions, kneejerk in character. They must be told the compelling 
reasons why we did what we did.
    
There is no doubt that sanctions will hurt and bite but who knows 
this may be a God-given opportunity to heal political wounds and 
build a national consensus on issues of vital interests. Politics 
need not be divisive. It need not tear us apart for what divides 
the political factions are essentially trivial issues. This is the 
chance to rebuild old bridges.
But austerity must be commonly shared. There is no point in asking 
the people to tighten their belts while our ruling class continues 
to wear both belts and braces. Austerity means doing without and it 
means a simple life. But the example must be set from the top. 
Eating grass is not a problem but we all must share the same meal.

<a name="will">Will Mohsin Khan be able to deliver the goods?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

Cricket enthusiasts had quite a surprise when the board assigned 
Mohsin Hasan Khan the job of conducting the training of about three 
dozen players, most of them in the category of senior stars, having 
represented the country both in the Test matches and one-dayers. 
His official designation will be camp commandant.
    
As a batsman with pleasing strokes from January 1978 against 
England to the Test series against the West Indies in late 1986 
Mohsin played a stellar role in Pakistan's cricket. He was also a 
crisp fielder, alert at any position.
    
Since for the last 12 years he had withdrawn himself from the 
national cricketing scene one thought that he would prefer not to 
accept such onerous responsibility as camp commandant. But he says 
he was observing the ups and downs in the country's cricket 
fortunes and studying the forms and performances of the players. 
Apparently there was no need for the board to invite quite a large 
cluster of cricketers for such serious physical workouts during an 
off-season when the two insignificant tournaments in Kuala Lumpur 
and Nairobi have almost been struck out from the programme. But 
then the game's watchers point to major fitness problems to senior 
players, particularly on foreign trips. Physical training sessions 
should be welcome to keep the national cricketers and the stand-
byes in top shape. Even if some of them are lethargic or are not in 
perfect trim they will become more active on the field after the 
training schedule is over in one-and a half month. Several key 
players like Aamir Sohail and Inzamamul Haq to name only two listed 
among camp invitees had at various stages found the going in 
competitive cricket quite hard. Their unfitness which upset the 
balance of the squad, even though the breach was filled by 
replacements. An exposure to training would also trace out the 
physical infirmities of the invitees, which means that their 
illness and injury would go through the necessary treatment earlier 
than during the duels at home or aboard.
    
It is a ticklish question if Mohsin Khan will be successful in the 
job given to him. No doubt he was a delightful stroke-maker and 
perhaps none could hit the ball with such abandon and success all 
round the wicket as this tall and elegant-looking opener. But there 
was also in him a casual approach towards the game. And that is why 
many critics doubt if he will be able to deliver the goods.
    
Mohsin and the cricket board have yet to strike a deal on the 
former's appointment and the emoluments to be given to him. That 
will give formality to the offer and assignment. Perhaps the 
designation of commandant was an easier process for a later 
nomination as cricket manager, which requires the endorsement of 
the executive council, yet to meet for sometime. Though Mohsin Khan 
has given his priorities for a disciplined schedule at the camp the 
PCB Chief Executive wants to see the results of his efforts. Then 
only the former Test opener can get an offer of more responsible, 
more testing assignment at home or away on tours.
    
Whatever Haroon Rashid, who has just ended his contract with the 
PCB might think of himself, cricket circles are of the opinion that 
he was far from a successful coach or cricket manager. The needed 
guidance was hardly provided to the playing lot. The squad should 
have performed as a unit, but this was not so. If at all there were 
weaknesses in some players the coach should have seen to it that 
they are overcome. The humiliation to the touring set in the South 
African triangular was agonising as was the upset in the last Test 
and the tri-nation final in the golden jubilee competition in 
Lahore. Pakistan capitulated to South Africa in the Faisalabad Test 
while needing only a tiny 140. The defeat came as a nine-day 
wonder. The record of Haroon could not have earned him a contract 
renewal. It is possible he may have received prior signals from the 
board as he hurriedly submitted his resignation as a board 
appointee for he was raised to the senior managership from the 
junior team  or perhaps he was holding a dual charge, besides 
being a selector.

Several veteran cricketers have put forward the claims of former 
Test captain, Javed Miandad, for appointment on a long-term basis 
as a cricket manager. They have taken the return from wilderness of 
Mohsin Khan with a pinch of salt. Javed was a world class batsman, 
both in Test cricket and the limited-overs game. He was 
exceptionally competent, tough, rugged with audacity to cut to size 
any sort of attack. 
    
Miandad has several times expressed his desire to serve the 
country's cricket. It was time that one of the all-time great 
cricketers was booked by the board for the right job. The vacancy 
has been created by the voluntary resignation of Haroon Rashid.

The PCB will not be making a U-turn after announcing a provisional 
appointment but it will be the right decision in view of the hard 
and stiff challenge the country faces in the World Cup and the 
heavy engagements during this year and the following one.
