<a name="ajkp">AJK premier dissolves cabinet</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff  Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Jan 14: In an expected move, AJK Prime Minister 
Barrister Sultan Mahmood Choudhry on Friday dissolved his cabinet, 
comprising 17 members, to form a smaller cabinet. The action has 
reportedly been taken in the light of directives of the federal 
government.

At the start of his government, the prime minister had formed only 
a nine-member cabinet on Aug 1, 1996. However, the strength of the 
cabinet soared to 17 by Aug 28, 1996. The third expansion in the 
cabinet was made on Dec 27, 1997, following the failure of the no- 
confidence move against the prime minister, which raised the figure 
to 19. However, one minister died later while the other resigned in 
September last year, bringing the strength down to 17.

The sources said that the dissolution of the cabinet had been 
necessitated in the wake of clear directives of the new military 
government in Islamabad to the AJK PM for reduction in the cabinet. 
Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf had categorically asked 
the AJK premier at the budget meeting of AJK Council last year that 
he should cut the size of his cabinet. During his visit to 
Muzaffarabad on Dec 27 last year, the CE reiterated his directive.

A nine-member new cabinet was likely to be announced in next few 
days, the source said. However, there was no decision on the part 
of the government about seven legislative assembly members and a 
non- elected adviser, enjoying the status of ministers.

<a name="rest">Restoration of Eighth amendment under study</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Jan 13: The military government before going back to 
barracks is expected to take steps to restore, through a revived or 
newly elected parliament, the defunct Eighth amendment. This would 
give back to the president powers to dissolve an elected 
parliament, remove a government and appoint the chiefs of armed 
forces.

Official sources told Dawn that the Chief Executive General Pervez 
Musharraf was in contact with constitutional experts, specially 
Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada, discussing the restoration of the Eighth 
amendment so that army was not required to intervene every time 
when there was a political crisis in the country.

Attorney General Aziz A. Munshi, sources said, has been entrusted 
with the job to work out details in this connection in consultation 
with the ministry of law. The sources said that Clause 58(2)(B) was 
needed to be restored by undoing the 13th amendment which was 
adopted by the suspended parliament. 

The chief executive, sources said, was of the view that the affairs 
of the country should be handled by the civilians and democratic 
elements and not by the army whose job should be to defend the 
country against internal and external threats.

The sources said that the attorney general was also directed to 
complete the spade work to give a legal cover to the National 
Security Council (NSC). He has been asked to give a permanent role 
to the NSC in the constitution and its role should be endorsed and 
approved by the parliament. It may be pointed out that Aziz A. 
Munshi was the co-author of the Eighth amendment along with Syed 
Sharifuddin Pirzada. This amendment was passed in December, 1985 by 
the elected but non-party based parliament which voted the 
amendment as a trade off for the immediate lifting of the martial 
law.

<a name="hija">Hijacking: US sees 'evidence'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

WASHINGTON, Jan 12: The Indians have provided "some evidence" to US 
officials on alleged Pakistan involvement in the Indian Airlines 
hijacking, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday.

"We have spoken to Indian officials about the evidence they have. 
In fact, we have seen some of it. I can't say categorically that we 
have seen it all. That is something that we are working with them 
on," the official told Dawn.

But observers said India was still far from convincing the US to 
declare Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism based on the evidence 
in the hijacking case. The real opposition to the Indian moves is 
coming from Congress and even pro-Indian congressmen do not believe 
that declaring Pakistan a terrorist state would help US policy and 
strategic interests.

Congressman Sam Gejdenson said in New Delhi on Tuesday "declaring a 
country a terrorist state was a tough call and led to loss of 
leverage. Putting a country out is also a statement of failure. In 
Sudan, in Libya, it has taken decades to get any kind of progress," 
he said.

The chairman of the influential Government Reform Committee, 
Congressman Dan Burton, issued a statement in Washington 
criticizing India for issuing inflammatory statements regarding the 
hijacking.

"I would hope that the Indian government would stop making public 
statements regarding the hijacking. Every statement I have seen 
from the Pakistani government has condemned the hijacking and I am 
told that they are committed to seeking the arrest and prosecution 
of the hijackers," Burton, a close friend of Pakistan, said.

He implicitly accused India of "trying to exploit the situation for 
domestic political purposes" and said "this is a time for all 
governments, including the US, to work together to bring these 
people to justice."

<a name="fosl">FO slams ISF for arson in Valley</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 12: Pakistan condemned what it called a wanton act 
of arson committed by the Indian Security Forces (ISF) in the town 
of Pattan, north of Srinagar. Numerous shops and houses were 
gutted, and six firemen and three civilians were shot at and 
seriously wounded by the Indian security forces in the incident.

A statement of the foreign office spokesman issued here termed the 
incident another glaring example of a willful campaign of brutal 
repression and atrocities being carried out by the Indian security 
forces since 1989.

"This incident is reminiscent of a similar barbaric act by the 
Indian security forces committed on Nov 27, 1993 when they torched 
over 150 shops and houses in Sopore and killed scores of innocent 
Kashmiris," the statement said.

The atrocities being committed by the Indian security forces in 
occupied Kashmir, the FO said, followed a consistent pattern, which 
had been repeatedly condemned by major international human rights 
organizations.

The latest report of the human rights watch, titled "World Report 
2000", stated that the Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir 
continued to violate human rights with impunity, and that military-
led cordon and search operations in Muslim neighbourhoods resulted 
in violations of fundamental civil rights.

"Pakistan calls upon the international community and human rights 
organizations to pressurize India to end its policy of brazen 
repression and honor the legitimate rights of the people of Kashmir 
including their inalienable right to self- determination," the 
statement noted.

<a name="hara">Harassment of diplomat decried</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 13: Pakistan has strongly protested against the 
harassment of an official of its High Commission in New Delhi on 
frivolous charges.

The foreign office summoned a senior Indian diplomat and lodged a 
protest against the "harassment" of the official, sources in the 
foreign office said. The protest is related to accusations that the 
Pakistani official used fake currency notes to pay his son's school 
fees. The Indian diplomat was told that the "frivolous" allegation 
was aimed at harassing the official, the sources said.

Commenting on the UNI report, they informed that the deputy high 
commissioner of India to Pakistan was summoned in the foreign 
office on Thursday and a protest was lodged against undue 
harassment and frivolous accusations against the Pakistani 
official. They said the High Commission obtained all its local 
currency notes from the State Bank of India. "Since the hijacking 
of the Indian airlines flight, there has been a concerted attempt 
to implicate Pakistan", they added. "This latest report is a part 
and parcel of the deliberate and vicious campaign of vilification 
against Pakistan", they concluded.-AFP/APP

<a name="jave">Javed Iqbal records confessional statement before magistrate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Jan 13: The self-confessed killer of 100 children, Javed 
Iqbal, recorded his confessional statement before judicial 
magistrate Mian Ghulam Husain and later he was sent on judicial 
remand.

Earlier on Thursday morning, police acquired for a day the physical 
remand of Javed and his co-accused Sajid, Nadeem and Sabir. The 
prosecution said they needed Javed's assistance to locate the press 
from where he got published the advertisements for lost children. 
The police also had to identify the place where he discharged the 
chemicals in which he claims to have dissolved the bodies of the 
murdered children. However, police returned with Javed to the court 
late in the afternoon and said they had located the place where he 
disposed of the chemicals and the printing press from where he got 
published advertisements. The police said the custody of the 
accused was not required anymore.

The court asked the accused if he wanted to record his confessional 
statement. Javed and his co-accused had expressed their intention 
of recording such a statement on the previous date of hearing but 
the court had given them time to think the matter over. It had told 
the accused that the statement could be used against them during 
trial. The magistrate left them alone in the courtroom for some 
time to think over the matter and then proceeded to record their 
statement.

Javed said he thought of killing the children when he was tortured 
by two people and left for dead. He had to sell his household items 
to pay for medical treatment. During this time his mother died from 
the shock of seeing him in distress. Then he decided to avenge his 
mother's death and kill children.

He said initially he used to discharge the chemical in the manhole 
in his house but when the neighbours started feeling foul smell he 
chose Old Ravi for disposing the acid after dissolving the bodies 
of children in it. He said he attracted the children by promising 
to show them television. He made them unconscious by offering them 
tea containing sedatives and killed them.

One of the co-accused, Sajid, said he was aware of 98 murders. 
Sabir said he was involved in one murder while Nadeem said he knew 
about 13 killings. Meanwhile, the police officers investigating the 
case claimed to have established the identity of two of the three 
boys whose remains were recovered from acid-filled containers from 
the Ravi Road house.

One of the investigating officers said it has been established 
beyond doubt that the remains were of masseur Ejaz, a resident of 
Kasur, and Imran, a resident of Toba Tek Singh.

The pictures of the boys were among the last snapped by the 
accused. "The younger brother of Ejaz has also identified the 
accused and the Ravi Road house," the officer said. He said: 
"Ejaz's brother told us that they were present near the Minar-i-
Pakistan when a man accompanied by two youths approached them. They 
took the boys to the Ravi Road house for massaging a man (Javed 
Iqbal) who they claimed had suffered paralysis."

"I left Ejaz at the house and went home. Ejaz did not return home 
in the night and when I went to the Ravi Road house in the morning 
I was told that he left shortly afterwards," Ejaz's brother told 
police. The name of Ejaz was present at number 97 in the list of 
the victims provided by Javed Iqbal while his picture was numbered 
57.

The officer said they have sufficient evidence to prove that some 
of the remains were of Ejaz. Police have recovered Ejaz's clothes, 
oil bottles and shoes from the house. He said the victim's brother 
would appear as a witness against him in the court. Similarly, the 
police have gathered sufficient evidence to prove that remains of 
Imran of Toba Tek Singh were present in the container.

<a name="shcj">SHC judge refuses to hear plane conspiracy case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shamim-ur-Rehman

KARACHI, Jan 12: Taking serious notice of the presence of the 
intelligence officials in the courtroom, Justice Shabbir Ahmed, 
administrative judge of the Anti-Terrorism Court, refused to 
conduct the trial and transferred it to the court of Judge Rehmat 
Hussain Jafferi of ATC-1 for resuming proceedings on Jan 17.

Originally, the case was initiated in the court of Judge Rehmat 
Hussain Jafferi, but the government amended the ATA ordinance to 
make it possible for a High Court Judge to try the case in view of 
its importance. After the amendment, the case was transferred to 
Justice Shabbir Ahmed, who was made administrative judge of the ATC 
through an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act.

The decision by Justice Ahmed came as a surprise to those present 
in the courtroom, especially the prosecution, which had earlier 
insisted that the court should proceed with the framing of charges 
against the ousted prime minister and five others.

The uproar and commotion was prompted by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. One 
of the six accused, who had complained that he had a feeling that 
they were not under the judicial custody and that in violation of 
the court's order intelligence officials were present in the 
courtroom - even sitting with the accused.

Justice Ahmed inquired who was the person, and when Mr Abbasi 
pointed to an individual, who was sitting among the accused, he 
directed that the person should be taken into custody. By this time 
some of the officials of the intelligence agencies and the rangers 
in civilian dress slipped out of the courtroom. Taking advantage of 
the commotion when Muslim Leaguers and others drew the court's 
attention to the fact that there were many more intelligence 
personnel present in the court room. Justice Ahmed ordered the 
doors of the court room to be closed.

The advocate-general of Sindh, Raja Qureshi, complained that no 
decorum was being maintained in the court. During this time one of 
the intelligence officials was brought before Justice Ahmed, who 
asked him who he was. When he disclosed that he belonged to the 
Rangers, Justice Ahmed asked the AG who had allowed them into the 
court. The AG pointed to an official of the Sindh High Court. It 
may be pointed out that entry into the court room is through a pass 
issued by the Registrar, SHC.

Justice Ahmed then observed: "This is my court; no one can allow 
them in my court. I will not allow intelligence people in civvies 
in my court." After a little pause he ordered the intelligence and 
rangers officials to leave the courtroom and observed that "in 
these circumstances I can't try this case." He also observed that 
under these circumstances it was not possible for him to conduct 
the proceedings in a free and fair manner.

In his brief order Justice Shabbir Ahmed said the "matter is 
transferred to the Court of Rehmat Hussain Jafferi, ATC No.1, 
Karachi, for disposal according to law." He also remanded the 
accused to the judicial custody, for production before Judge 
Jafferi on Jan 17.

<a name="plan">Plane conspiracy case: Nawaz's petition on jurisdiction rejected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff  Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 12: Justice Shabbir Ahmed, the administrative judge of 
the anti-terrorism courts, dismissed the defence petition 
challenging the court's jurisdiction in the Oct 12 plane conspiracy 
case and held that the case was triable by the anti-terrorism 
courts.

Ijaz Hussain Batalvi, counsel for Nawaz Sharif, had filed a 
petition under section 196 of CrPC and all other enabling 
provisions for declaring the proceedings against the petitioner 
coram non-judice, unlawful, without jurisdiction and without lawful 
authority.

The accused - Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Syed Ghous Ali Shah, 
Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Saifur Rahman and Saeed 
Mehdi - have been charge-sheeted under sections 120-B, 121, 121A, 
122, 123, 365, 402B, 109, 324 Qisas and Diyat/PPC and sections 6 
and 7 of the Anti-terrorism Act, 1997.

Justice Shabbir recalled Mr Batalvi's reference to various 
offences, including the charge of hijacking and waging war against 
Pakistan and the lodging of complaint by Lt-Col Ateequzzaman 
Kayani.

Mr Batalvi had cited many cases in defence of his petition on the 
triability of the case while praying that cognisance of the challan 
being illegal, without jurisdiction, without lawful authority, and 
void ab initio, no proceedings could be commenced or continued 
against the petitioner.

After examining various cases cited by the defence and the 
prosecution and various other cases, appropriate to interpret the 
relevant law, Justice Shabbir ordered that "the case in hand is 
under special law. The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
are inapplicable to the proceedings arising out of the special law 
by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Code and section 
32 of the Act, 1997, has overriding effect."

He thus ruled that there being inconsistency and difference between 
provisions of section 30 of the Act and section 196 of CrPC, the 
provisions contained in the latter would not be applicable to the 
proceedings of the special court. In view of the above-mentioned 
inconsistency, section 32 of the Act would come into play and the 
bar contained in section 196 of CrPC would not in any way affect 
taking of cognisance by this court in exercising power under 
section 19 of the ATA Act, the order said.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz says country stands isolated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 12: Deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif claimed on 
that Pakistan today stood isolated and was threatened with being 
declared a terrorist state.

Talking to newsmen before the commencement of proceedings in the 
Oct 12 plane conspiracy case, Nawaz Sharif said: "Pakistan's image 
has suffered and it has been isolated due to military takeover."

Mr Sharif's remarks were seen as a criticism of the government's 
statement, countering Indian accusations pertaining to the 
hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and international reaction 
to the statement made by Azhar Masood, one of the freed Kashmiri 
freedom fighter.

Mr Sharif claimed that he had taken initiatives for a negotiated 
settlement of the Kashmir issue, but the dismissal of his 
government on Oct 12 had altered the situation and tension in the 
region had increased.

"Pakistan's security is at stake as it has become dangerously 
isolated," said the ousted prime minister who claimed that no 
investment was taking place and the government was begging the IMF 
for the release of 280 million dollars assistance. He claimed that 
SAARC had disowned Pakistan and the Commonwealth had suspended its 
membership since the military coup which toppled his government.

Later, commenting on the transfer of his case by Justice Shabbir to 
the court of Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafferi, Mr Sharif said the order 
had vindicated his contention that the government's intentions were 
mala fide. "The order has proved that the government is not 
interested in a free and a fair trial. They have arrested an 
elected prime minister and want to hang him," alleged Mr Sharif, 
claiming that he and his colleagues had not committed any act of 
treason or crime but the entire nation had been taken as hostage to 
punish one man.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff  Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 12: The prosecution in the Oct 12 plane conspiracy 
case alleged that the former chief of the Ehtesab Cell, Saifur 
Rehman, one of the six accused, had planned a jailbreak in the 
Landhi prison. 

This was disclosed by the Sindh advocate-general, Raja Qureshi, 
while making his submissions before justice Shabbir Ahmed. Claiming 
that a map of the premises of the Landhi prison, where all the six 
accused are lodged, was recovered from the daughter of Saifur 
Rehman during a search after she had met her father on the Eid day. 
He feared a jailbreak had been planned. 

Justice Shabbir asked him to move a proper application before 
placing the relevant documents on record.

Later talking to newsmen outside his office about the alleged plan, 
Mr Qureshi said "a sketch was recovered from the daughter of Saifur 
Rehman." He identified the daughter as Ayesha and said that even 
the suspended senator had admitted drawing the sketch but was now 
giving a different interpretation.

Staff Correspondent

QUETTA, Jan 12: The chief of the Marri tribe, Nawab Khair Bukhsh 
Marri, was shifted to the Quetta district jail on judicial remand 
official sources said. Nawab Khair Bukhsh Marri was arrested from 
his residence by the police in connection with the murder of 
Justice Mohammad Nawaz Marri.

Nawab Marri was nominated along with his five sons in the FIR 
lodged by the nephew of the late Justice Marri, Shah Jamal Marri. 
However, others nominated in the FIR have not been arrested so far.

Meanwhile, the murder case of the late Justice Marri had been 
handed over to the Crime Investigation Agency so that the killers 
could be arrested as early as possible, official sources said. A 
team of senior CIA officers had been constituted for investigation 
into the murder case.

They added that during interrogation some suspects of the Marri 
tribe had divulged useful information. The police and the officials 
of the local administration continued to raid various areas for the 
arrest of the late Justice Marri's killers.

<a name="high">High Court allows Asif's revision appeal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Jan 13: A division bench of the Sindh High Court allowed 
the criminal revision appeal of Asif Ali Zardari. The appeal was 
made against the judgment of the district and sessions judge 
Karachi Central for shifting proceedings of the double-murder case 
of Justice Nizam Ahmed and his son, Nadeem Ahmed, from a Special 
Court of Suppression of Terrorism Activities (STA) to an anti-
terrorism court.

The sessions judge had ordered the transfer of the case to an ATC 
on the application of the investigation officer (IO) of the case, a 
CIA DSP. In the application, he had requested for transfer of the 
matter to an ATC. Nizam Ahmed and his son, Nadeem Ahmed, were 
murdered with automatic weapons in PECHS area of Karachi on June 
10, 1996. The police had proved involvement of Asif Zardari. The IO 
of the case had also prayed to submit the challan in an ATC.

Farooq H. Naek, counsel for Asif Zardari, challenging the orders of 
the sessions court, submitted before a division bench of the SHC, 
consisting of Justice Hamid Ali Mirza and Justice Ashraf Leghari, 
that his client was not involved in any terrorism and was 
implicated in the case on political grounds. He said the police 
arrested Javed Pirzada and another accused, who named his client, 
after being tortured at CIA police stations.-PPI/APP

<a name="natu">Natural gas regulatory authority established</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Jan 11: The government on promulgated an ordinance 
seeking establishment of Natural Gas Regulatory Authority (NGRA), 
in a major legislative step towards the privatization of two major 
gas distribution companies of the country.

The delay in creation of NGRA had stalled the whole privatization 
program of Sui Northern and Sui Southern gas pipeline companies, 
which has been on cards for the last a decade.

The privatization commission of Pakistan despite its best efforts 
could not get the law passed in the previous Muslim League 
government as certain vested interests were not in favor of 
privatization of the two major gas distribution companies.

The authority, comprising a chairman and two members - designated 
as member, technical, and member, finance - will have the exclusive 
powers to issue licenses and regulate gas distribution activity in 
the country. The authority, keeping consumers interests supreme, 
will also prescribe, review, approve and regulate tariffs, the 
ordinance said. It will also have the powers to determine the well-
head gas prices for the producers in accordance with the relevant 
agreements or contract.

The ordinance laid out a procedure for determination of gas prices 
for retail consumers. The authority, after determining total 
revenue requirement of a licenses, will prescribe the prices for 
different categories of retail consumers, it added.

Under the newly-promulgated ordinance all the applicants for the 
distribution licenses would have to get themselves registered as a 
company under the provision of the companies ordinance 1984, unless 
specifically exempted by the authority. The authority will also be 
open to public scrutiny and as per the terms and conditions it will 
maintain public files containing all relevant documents.

<a name="wapd">WAPDA labor unions: ILO to get aid suspended if ban not lifted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Jan 11: The International Labor Organization (ILO) has 
warned Pakistan that if restrictions on WAPDA's labor unions were 
not lifted by May this year it will be constrained to ask the World 
Bank and the IMF to suspend aid to Pakistan .

The ILO experts' committee which reviewed reports, received in case 
No 2006 in Nov 1999, had recommended that the ILO governing body 
approve a six-point indictment against the government of Pakistan.
 
The case, No 2006, was initiated on a complaint filed with the ILO 
by the All Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions (APFTU) in Feb 1999. 
The Public Service International (PSI) and the International 
Federation of Free Trade Unions (CFTU) have also associated 
themselves with this complaint. The FOGSEW filed their complaint 
with the ILO on June 8, 1999.

The ILO experts' committee has also recommended that the 
promulgation of Ordinance NoXX of 1998, which suspended the trade 
union rights of WAPDA workers and prevented the WAPDA Hydroelectric 
Central Labor Union (HCLU) from carrying out its normal trade union 
activities, be deplored.

The committee urged the government to immediately repeal ordinance 
V, replaced by the subsequent Ordinance XIV of 1999, promulgated on 
Sept 24, with a view to re-establish the registration of the 
Pakistan WAPDA HCLU. It also requested the government to ensure 
that the practice of deducting trade union dues was resumed without 
delay.

The committee further urged the government to reply, without delay, 
to the allegations of the Federation of Oil, Gas, Steel and 
Electricity Workers (FOGSEW), contained in a communication dated 
June 8, 1999. It also recommended deploring the fact that certain 
WAPDA and KESC union officials were retired forcibly.

<a name="usma">US may not release list of Pakistan firms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Jan 12: The much-awaited list of Pakistan entities to 
be exempted from nuclear sanctions may not be released by the US, a 
senior state department official indicated.

The release of the Pakistan list was expected soon after the 
commerce department exempted 51 Indian companies in the middle of 
December, but now the state department says there may not be a 
special list for Pakistan entities.

"There may be a mis-perception that there was a separate Pakistan 
list that we were just getting ready to release," the official said 
when asked about the removal of sanctions on Pakistan entities.

"We reviewed the entities in both countries (in December) and the 
list we came up with was released. We are continuing the review 
process and there could be further entities taken off, or added on. 
Its an on-going process. There was not supposed to be a Pakistan 
list as such," the official told Dawn.

He explained that the process of removing companies from the 
sanctions list was not a political process. "It is a technical 
process. You can't separate on the basis of countries. It was not a 
special India list (released in December) and there is no special 
Pakistan list," he said.

The same official had in December said the process was not a 
balancing act between India and Pakistan and the inter-agency 
committee would review the list of Pakistan entities and the same 
criterion would be applied.

<a name="ukgo">UK govt split over arms embargo on Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nasir Malick

LONDON, Jan 12: The Labour government cabinet is split over a 
proposal to lift restrictions on arms sales to Pakistan and Defense 
and Industries Secretaries are pressing for an end to a freeze on 

80 arms exports licenses imposed by the government after October's 
military take-over in Pakistan.

According to leaked cabinet office papers, The Guardian claimed 
that cabinet ministers are embroiled in one of the biggest internal 
disputes since Labor came into power over the issue of lifting arms 
embargo from Pakistan. Quoting minutes from a cabinet office 
meeting last month, the paper said that Defense Secretary Geoff 
Hoon and Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers are pressing 
for an end to a freeze on 80 arms exports licenses imposed after 
last October's military take-over. But Foreign Secretary Robin Cook 
and International Development Secretary Clare Short are "implacably 
opposed" and still committed to the principle of an "ethical 
foreign policy".

The British foreign secretary was in the forefront of a campaign 
that was aimed at having Pakistan suspended from almost every 
Commonwealth body following the military take-over.

"The whole arms issue is one of the most emotive facing Labor 
ministers and MPs, exposing the line between support for the 
defense industry and support for democratic government and genuine 
aid projects," the paper said. The paper quoted a junior minister, 
opposed to the arms sales, as saying that: "If we lose this, it 
will be Indonesia next, and Nigeria after that. This is the filthy 
end of foreign policy."

The paper quoted the minister as saying that Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's track record had been poor on arms, tending to side with 
the powerful DTI and the ministry of defense axis.

The issue has cropped up at a time when British Defence Chief Sir 
Charles Guthrie will be arriving in Pakistan on Thursday for high-
level talks with General Pervez Musharraf.

Although no formal arms embargo was imposed by Britain, the paper 
quoted the Foreign Office as having confirmed on Tuesday that no 
new applications for export licenses had been approved since the 
army take-over.

The leaked minutes disclose that senior civil servants from the 
Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defence, Foreign 
Office, Department of International Development, Treasury and 
Customs and Excise met at the cabinet office on Dec 8.

 The minutes, dated the following day, record that "as part of our 
initial response to the October coup, the government decided to 
keep all current arms export applications for Pakistan under review 
until the situation becomes clearer. As a result, there are 
something like 80 pending applications and exporters are becoming 
increasingly impatient and suspicious."

The minutes note: "EU partners seem to be doing business as usual 
and show no signs of wanting to contemplate an arms embargo." 
Crucially, they add: "MoD and DTI, therefore, wish to expedite the 
consideration of these applications in the normal way."

According to the paper, other cabinet papers show that Mr Cook 
"agreed strongly" that there should be no return to the normal flow 
of military hardware until Pakistan provided firm commitments.

Another paper said that Ms Short was "strongly opposed to the 
Whitehall consensus in favor of processing outstanding export 

license applications to Pakistan. "The secretary of state's (Ms 
Short's) view is that it is outrageous to consider arms exports 
before the International Monetary Fund program and aid have been 
re-engaged."

International Development Secretary Clare Short had suspended an 
aid program for Pakistan after the military takeover in October.

<a name="ukca">UK cabinet split over licenses for arms export to Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Jan 13: The chances of new licenses for arms exports to 
Pakistan being approved by the British government look increasingly 
unlikely after the department of trade and industry said it would 
abide by the foreign office advice and not insist on lifting the 
ban. This was reported by The Guardian newspaper.

It had carried a front-page story, based on leaked cabinet 
documents, claiming that there was a split in the cabinet with 
department of trade and industry and ministry of defense trying to 
expedite 80 export licenses frozen after the military take-over in 
Pakistan. It said that the foreign office and the department of 
international trade (DIT) were opposing the lifting of the 
unofficial embargo.

In a follow-up story, The Guardian on Thursday quoted an un-named 
source in DTI as saying that said the trade and industry secretary, 
Stephen Byers, will not act against the advice of the foreign 
office on such matters.

The paper said although the government officials did not publicly 
comment on the leaked documents but confirmed privately that the 
minutes were accurate. "If the battle between the DTI-MoD axis and 
the FO and international development duo had continued, the issue 
would have had to be resolved by 10 Downing Street," the paper 
claimed.

Prime Minister Tony Blair played down the disclosures of a rift 
between ministers over foreign policy during the question hour in 
the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. He was pressed by 
Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who said he wanted to 
challenge him over his promise of pursuing an ethical foreign 
policy.

"Now does he support the foreign secretary and the international 
development secretary in opposing the resumption of arms sales to 
Pakistan until democratic guarantees are in place?" Mr Kennedy 
asked.

Mr Blair replied: "This question is based on a misunderstanding. As 
far as I am aware, there is no dispute between government 
departments at all. As far as I am aware, there are no proposed 
[arms] sales taking place."

Later, Mr Kennedy wrote to Mr Blair: "It is reported in today's 
Guardian, based on a cabinet minutes of December 8, 1999, that 
there should be a return to normal sales of arms to Pakistan - a 
move that was strongly resisted by Clare Short and Robin Cook. Was 
that not the case?" Meanwhile The Times newspaper said on Thursday 
that Prime Minister Tony Blair had sent Gen Charles Guthrie, the 
Chief of the Defence Staff, to Pakistan as a special envoy to try 
to persuade the military leader to restore democracy.

Gen Guthrie has known Gen Pervaiz Musharraf for many years. "The 
decision to use the good offices of Gen Guthrie came after a 
meeting between the prime minister, Robin Cook, the foreign 
secretary, and Geoffrey Hoon, the defence secretary," the paper 
said, adding that the foreign office sources said they agreed the 
general was in a unique position to talk frankly on a "military man 
to military man" basis with Gen Musharraf.

It quoted foreign office sources as saying that the government was 
concerned that since the coup there had been little progress in 
returning Pakistan to democratic rule.

The paper said although Sir David Dain, the high commissioner in 
Islamabad, had been underlining the government's concern about Gen 
Musharraf's failure to give a timetable for democratic elections, 
it was felt that a meeting with Gen Guthrie might provide 
additional pressure.

"Although the 61-year-old chief of the defense staff is not a 
military contemporary of the 56-year-old Pakistan leader, their 
career paths have crossed on several occasions. Both were their 
respective country's army chief of staff. They also share a special 
forces background," the paper said . "Gen Guthrie spent several 
years in the SAS as a young officer and is the new commandant of 
the special air service. Gen Musharraf trained as a member of 
Pakistan's special services group commandos and saw action in wars 
with India in 1965 and 1971."

<a name="ukur">UK urges immediate talks on Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Jan 13: Gen Charles Guthrie, British chief of the 
defense staff, expressed deep concern on the Kashmir situation and 
regional security environment and called for resumption of the 
stalled Pakistan-India talks as early as possible.

The British chief of defense staff, who was speaking to a group of 
journalists shortly after having talks with Chief Executive Gen 
Pervez Musharraf, said he was "deeply worried" over the Kashmir 
situation. Which, according to him, looked dangerous for some time 
because the two nations, Pakistan and India, had been at 
loggerheads over the Kashmir problem.

He said he hoped Pakistan and India would "find ways to revive the 
Lahore process, addressing the issue bilaterally which divides 
them". The situation, he observed, had become more dangerous 
following the nuclear tests in 1998 by the two countries.

Gen Guthrie said that among other subjects the two generals had 
also discussed the recent hijacking of an Indian airliner, and 
observed they agreed that terrorism was a scourge in the world and 
its perpetrators needed to be brought to justice.

The British defense chief said Pakistan had not made any specific 
arms supply requests during the talks with Gen Musharraf. No arms 
embargo, he said, had been imposed against Pakistan but pointed out 
that existing Pakistan's requests for arms from Britain were taking 
long to process as it might happen in cases of requests from other 
states.

<a name="lhcb">LHCBA rejects any move to sign CTBT</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Jan 12: A general body meeting of the Lahore High Court Bar 
Association unanimously rejected any move to sign the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty after hearing the views of a former ISI chief and a 
nuclear scientist on the issue.

Lt-Gen (retd) Hamid Gul described the pressure to sign CTBT as a 
conspiracy to deprive Pakistan of its nuclear capability and turn 
the people against their army. There was no need for a debate as 
the nation was determined to refine its nuclear devices and carry 
out explosions for the dual purpose of security and economic 
development. No government, particularly an unrepresentative one, 
has the authority to accede to the treaty. He distributed a booklet 
containing his views on the matter and urged the lawyers to 
mobilize public opinion against the signing of the CTBT.

The former director of the Inter-Services Intelligence particularly 
criticised Foreign Minister Abdus Sattar for favouring the treaty 
after opposing it vehemently in a newspaper article co-authored by 
him, former foreign minister Agha Shahi and former PAF chief Air 
Marshal Zulfiqar Ali Khan on Oct 5 last.

The objectives of the CTBT, he warned, are not confined to testing 
but embrace the whole gamut of nuclear research and Pakistan would 
eventually be asked to roll back its nuclear program. Foreign 
inspectors would land in Pakistan within 72 hours of a complaint 
lodged by any country and five monitoring devices are already lying 
with the US embassy in Islamabad to keep track of Pakistan's 
nuclear activities.

<a name="fmpr">FM protests against charge of treason</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 12: Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar has protested 
against the charge of treason being put on those who are favouring 
the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), adding 
that there was no need to become emotional over the issue.

In a statement issued here, the Foreign Office said that the 
foreign minister had protested against the charge of treason 
against those who had supported the signing of the CTBT in the 
ongoing debate over the issue. "He (the foreign minister) did not 
in any way, question the integrity and patriotism of Qazi Hussain 
Ahmad Sahib, Amir, Jamaat Islami, for whom he cherishes abiding 
respect, as he has informed Qazi Sahib in his letter of Jan 10. Nor 
did he made any comment in any conversation on the stance of 
Jamaat-i-Islami prior to 1947," the FO statement said.

"We need to understand what this treaty is and what it is not. The 
nation should discuss and debate its merits. Only thus, can we rise 
above slogans to a higher and more sophisticated level of 
understanding of our national interests," the FO statement quoted 
Mr Sattar as saying.

The statement said that the government was determined to maintain 
and develop Pakistan's nuclear capability to ensure a credible and 
reliable deterrence against manifest threats to its security.

It said that as the foreign minister had explained in his analysis 
on Jan 4, that the CTBT aimed only and exclusively at the 
prohibition of further nuclear tests and it had no bearing 
whatsoever on the existing strategic arsenals or even on their 
enlargement. It said that whenever the CTBT came into force, every 
state would be bound to refrain from conducting any nuclear tests. 
"If, before the treaty comes into force, another state conducts a 
test, Pakistan too will have the option to do so irrespective of 
whether it has signed the treaty or not," the FO statement 
concluded.

<a name="sind">Sindh to move court against WAPDA on power billing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Jan 14: The Sindh government has decided to seek judicial 
injunction from the Sindh High Court on implementation of the award 
given two months ago by the Federal Arbitrator, Justice Shafiur 
Rehman, on its dispute with the Water and Power Development 
Authority (WAPDA) on presumptive electricity billing.

"We are approaching the Sindh High Court next week on the federal 
arbitrator's award on the issue of presumptive electricity billing 
by WAPDA," the Sindh Advocate-General, Raja Qureshi, told Dawn.

Raja Qureshi was given the task to consider legal options available 
to the Sindh government after WAPDA reportedly rejected the 
position taken by the provincial government that it would accept 
the federal arbitrator's award but with correction in the liability 
payable to WAPDA to Rs1.15 billion from Rs2.7 billion. "The cause 
of action is in Sindh and the consequences are also here and 
therefore the Sindh High Court is the competent forum to take up 
this issue," Mr Qureshi offered the argument while disclosing that 
according to the information received by him.  WAPDA too, had 
approached a civil court in Rawalpindi on the issue. "So far we 
have not been served any notice," he pointed out.

<a name="expo">Exports finance 83.97pc of imports during July-Dec '99</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Jan 11: The proportion of imports paid for by exports 
during the last six months declined by about 3.17 per cent, as 
compared to the period July-December, 1998.

According to the provisional statistics released by the Federal 
Bureau of Statistics, exports, totalling $4.1bn and 7.42% higher 
than the comparable period of last year, covered 83.97% of the 
imports ($4.88bn). In July-Dec, 1998, the ratio of imports covered 
by exports was 87.14%.

Nevertheless, the figures show a slight improvement in the share of 
manufacturing exports. In July-December, 1998, their share in total 
exports was 88.83%. During the last 6 months, the exports covered 
88.50% of total exports. However, these exports registered a growth 
rate of 7.0%.

The textile manufactures totalled $2.68bn, 65.40% of total exports. 
During the comparable period of last year, their contribution to 
export receipts was 65.27%. The growth rate of these manufactures 
during the last six months has been 7.65%, compared to 8.93% 
increase during July-November, 1999. Lower growth is attributable 
to a decline of 3.21% during December 1999.

Of this, 18.19% was constituted by the exports of cotton yarn. 
According to statistics, the country exported 227,869 tons of 
cotton yarn, up 14.75% from the corresponding period of last year. 
The statistics also show that the cotton yarn was exported at lower 
unit rate than last year. Consequently, in dollar terms, the growth 
rate was actually half that of the growth rate in terms of 
quantity.

Similar trend is observed in respect of cotton fabrics. Although, 
quantitatively, their exports soared by 24.19%, the accrual in the 
shape of foreign exchange was only 3.18% higher. Yet, in terms of 
dollars, cotton fabrics come out on top. Their exports totalled 
$548.4m in the last six months. However, this reduces the share of 
cotton fabrics in total textile manufactures exports from 21.32% 
last year to 20.43% last year.

Other textile manufactures, which have shown positive export trend, 
in the first half of 1999-2000, in dollar terms were: knitwear 
(9.67%), bed wear (1669%), readymade garments (10.21%), tarpaulin & 
canvas goods (13.96%), tule, lace embroidery etc. (106.29%), 
synthetic textile fabrics (0.49%) and other textile made-up 
(excluding towels & bed-wear) (18.72%).

Towels, cotton bags/sacks and waste material of textile fabrics are 
the only items whose exports declined, respectively, by 13.82%, 
10.39% and 3.16%. But their share in total textile manufactures is 
negligible.

It is in the category "Other Manufactures" that the six-month 
period under report shows better performance (9.45%) than during 
the preceding five months (5.55%).  The exports of this category of 
manufactures totalled $584.3 m, thus improving their share in total 
exports from 13.97 in July-Dec, 1998, to 14.24% in the same period 
of current financial year.

In this category, highest accrual was from the export of leather 
manufactures - $184.4m. This is, however, 10.13% lower than during 
the same period in 1998-99. All the other items in this category 
including carpets, sports goods, surgical instruments, cutlery etc. 
have shown positive trend.

Primary commodities: This category accounted for 11.50% of total 
exports, as against 11.17% during the corresponding period of last 
year. As usual, highest item of export was rice. The quantity of 
rice exported during this period was 744,233 tons, up 13.81% from 
last year. A slight improvement in price is also indicated, because 
in dollar terms, the accrual was up by 14.15%.

As regards raw cotton, the country exported 12,046 tons,781.20% 
more than last year. But the slump in international market was 
translated into lower increase in quantity of its export - 420.27%. 
The price fetched by raw cotton this year was $773.5 per ton as 
against $1310.1 per ton last year.

Imports: Petroleum group has again emerged as the top item of 
import during the period. In terms of dollars, their import bill 
has gone up by 80.54% in the last 6 months from $664.93m in July-
December 1998 to $1.2bn in the corresponding period of current 
year. Partly, this is due to increase in international rate. For 
quantity-wise, the import of petroleum products went up by 16.14%, 
while that of petroleum crude has dropped by 6.68%.

During July-Dec, 1999, the average price was $150.15 per ton for 
pet. products, as against $93.87 per ton in the same period last 
year. As regards pet. crude, the average import price rose from 
$91.04 per ton to $165.19 ton this year.

In Dec, 1999, the price of both the groups of items underwent 
further increase - to $197.99 per ton for pet. products and $185.23 
per ton for pet. crude, showing an increase of $32.91 and $3.64, 
respectively. Compared to Dec 1998, the per ton price is quite 
dramatic: $111.86 per ton for pet. products and $106.28 per ton for 
pet. crude.

Quantity-wise, however, the import of both items decreased, 
respectively, by 3.91% and 2.35%. With two exception, imports of 
all the major groups show decline: Food group by 49.50%, Machinery 
group by 19.43%, Textile group, Agricultural & other chemicals 
group by 5.98% and miscellaneous group by 9.52%. In terms of 
dollars, Metal Group has increased its import bill by 22.78%. 
However, within the agricultural group, the import of insecticides 
went up by 22.53%.

<a name="hblt">HBL to be privatised in one go: Altaf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 14: The Government has decided to privatise Habib 
Bank Limited (HBL) in one go, Altaf Saleem, Chairman Privatisation 
Commission said.

Earlier, there was a proposal to privatise HBL by offering its 
different networks - Middle East branches, foreign branches and 
local branches - separately. "We have finally decided to offer the 
HBL as a whole," the Chairman said here.

HBL, one of the largest commercial bank of the country, was 
established in 1941 and operated in the private sector until it was 
nationalised in 1974. Apart from the huge network, it has at home, 
the Bank has its foreign network spread in Europe, Middle East, Far 
East, Asia, Africa and the United States.

Responding to a question, the Chairman said, the Privatisation Plan 
is almost in final stages and will be ready by the end of the 
current month to be presented to the government for approval. "Once 
the plan is approved by the government, we will start the process," 
he said. -APP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 14: The KSE index gained another 45 points or three 
per cent. The KSE 100-share index breached the second psychological 
barrier of 1,600 point during week, signalling that its next chart 
point could be 1,750.00 if all goes well with the current 
background news. It was last quoted around 1,626.10 as compared to 
1,581.60 a day earlier, up 44.50 points or 3.5%.

The total market capitalisation, showed a fresh increase of Rs13bn 
at Rs417.164bn as compared to Rs406.264bn a day earlier but it has 
to go a long way to match its previous peak level of Rs604bn hit 
some five years back.

Plus signs were again strewn all over the list, with leading shares 
being in the forefront of leading gainers under the lead of IGI, 
PIC, Pakistan Refinery, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Packages, Lever 
Brothers, Rafhan Best Foods and Rafhan Maize, which posted gains 
ranging from Rs4.00 to Rs35.00. But the largest gain of Rs22.00 was 
noted in BOC Pakistan. Other good gainers were led by Dewan Salman, 

National Refinery, Glaxo-Welcome and several others, rising by 
Rs3.55 to Rs3.85 amid active trading.

Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional barring Prudential 
Modaraba, EFU General, KASB Pumps, Century Paper and Nestle 
Milkpak, which suffered decline ranging from Rs1.45 to Rs11.00. 
Dewan Khalid Textiles and Dewan Textiles, which were quoted ex-
dividend were also traded lower by Rs6.00 and Rs30.27 respectively.

Trading volume rose to the third best figure of 275m shares in its 
trading history, the previous records being 290 and 315m shares as 
gainers maintained a strong lead over the last losers despite late 
selling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Jan 12: Karachi Stock Exchange registered the highest 
turnover of 314.769 million shares in its history. The previous 
record was that of 290.059 million shares on May 25, 1999. Another 
record was the highest number of trades in a single day: Wednesday 
(Jan 12) the market executed 50355 trades while the previous record 
was that of 42769 as on July 6, 1999.

The KSE-100 index has also increased by 71 points and touched the

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 13: The Automated Trading System of the Karachi Stock 
Exchange refused to take in the massive load of the rising volume 
and went out of order and the management has to suspended trading 
for the afternoon session. The KSE index ended with an extended 
gain of 10.75 points at 1,581.60 points.

The technical staff remained at the job all through late afternoon 
hours signalling to the KSE authorities that KATS is now perfectly 
in order and normal trading can be resumed. But some technical 
experts associated with the leading brokerage houses claim there 
could be more breakdowns of the system in future too as �it is 
pretty difficult for it to expand beyond its inherent intake 
capacity.�

Another leading stock analyst said there could be some fault in the 
Central Depository System(CDS) but the technical staff is not 
coming out with a precise answer to the questions of the members. � 
The CDS system develops technical fault whenever the volume figure 
crosses the 250m share mark', he said added 'I presume the system 
is not capable of taking in large volume say over 250m shares 
daily.'

Although official index figure was not available, it has certainly 
breached another psychological barrier of 1,600 points, breaking 
two barriers in identical sessions.

In the morning session, the KSE 100-share index showed a fresh rise 
of 10.75 points at 1,581.60 and advancing shares held a modest lead 
over the losers at 84 to 75, with 41 shares holding on to the last 
levels, out of the 200 actives. Trading volume fell to 147.348m 
shares as compared to 315m shares a day earlier bulk of which went 
to the credit of PTCL and Hub-Power.

The most active list was again topped by PTCL, up 55 paisa at 
Rs25.15 on 40m shares followed by Hub-Power higher 35 paisa at 
Rs24.00. Also on 40m shares, Sui Northern, lower 15 paisa at 
Rs18.15 on 6m shares, PSO, off one rupee at Rs222.90 on 5m shares 
and ICI Pakistan, easy five paisa at Rs11.35 on 3m shares.

Other actively traded shares were led by KESC, easy 10 paisa on 2m 
shares, followed by ICP SEMF, higher Rs1,45 on 2m shares, Adamjee 
Insurance, up Rs1.75 on 2m shares, Japan Power, up five paisa on 
1.665m shares and Fauji Fertiliser up 35 paisa on 1.602m shares.

<a name="kuch">�Kuch ishq kiya, kuch kaam kiya�</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

THIS is the title of a short poem by Faiz in which he says that in 
his life he did a bit of work and made some love but because his 
attention was split he turned out to be a failure both in work and 
love. Accordingly: Aakhir tang aakar, donon ko adhoora chorh diya 
(in the end, getting tired of it all, left both half-done).

This has been the story of my life too: a victim of dreams and 
vague yearnings, now trying one thing and now another and in the 
process piling up few successes and a string of failures. And yet, 
this being the important thing, not drawing any lesson from my 
follies. Even now as I approach my 50th year I am far from being 
the �magnanimous man� of whom Aristotle says he should have �a slow 
step...a deep voice and a level utterance.� In many things I remain 
a fool and even now a pretty dress or a well-turned ankle, to put 
it no stronger than this, is enough to ensure the crumbling of what 
little poise I possess.
    
I pen these confessions for no other reason than to make a feeble 
point. And it is this: that in the singular inability to draw any 
lessons from my past I find a remarkable affinity between myself 
and my country. When in a harsh mood with myself over the waste of 
my life, I derive perverse comfort from the knowledge that entities 
greater than myself have also made a bonfire of their 
opportunities.
    
What puts me in this maudlin strain this morning (the sky outside 
being of the same cast as my humour) is the news from Karachi where 
the high court judge hearing the so-called hijacking case against 
Nawaz Sharif and his co-accused has, in a fit of pique or a state 
of distress, sent the case back to the junior court where it was 
originally being heard.
    
Now there will be more lawyers� arguments and the government will 
be drawn further into this legal net. While this was supposed to be 
an open-and-shut case, it is now more than three months old already 
with some of the preliminary stages still to be cleared.
    
In some respects if not all, this case is reminiscent of Bhutto�s 
trial more than 20 years ago. The years seem to make no difference 
to the set patterns of our history: the exercise of arbitrary power 
by one ruler followed by the vindictiveness of those who come after 
him. Before we talk of making Pakistan a shining model of progress 
we should at least learn how to manage an orderly transition of 
power. I deliberately did not say a �constitutional� transition 
because abiding by the spirit of the Constitution somehow seems 
beyond our wildest capabilities.
    
Compounding the military government�s problems is its attempt to 
sit on two stools at the same time. It is a military government in 
all but name and therefore quite capable of being ruthless when it 
perceives its real or imagined interests to be threatened. Yet at 
the same time it is fiddling with open courts and a free press. 
Long may this contradiction last (for if it does not I at least 
will be out of a job) but in the plane hijacking case this 
contradiction is giving the government a headache. As time passes, 
it might cause further problems elsewhere.
    
That Nawaz Sharif was a high-flying figure of limited ability who 
yet dreamt of being Prince Salim and the Emperor Shahjahan rolled 
into one is something easily granted. But he has been deposed and 
from the heights of power flung into the depths of Landhi prison. 
The Greeks, contemplating this, would say this was tragedy enough. 
Obviously our sense of justice is keener than that of the Greeks 
because time and again we have proved that driving a fox into his 
hole is not enough and that hunting honor is not satisfied unless 
the fox is torn limb from limb in an orgy of blood.
    
If there were corruption cases against Nawaz Sharif it would have 
been more worthwhile from the military�s point of view to pursue 
them and go a bit easy on the hijacking case which, far from being 
a national issue, is beginning to look too much like a Musharraf vs 
Sharif standoff. But in its hurried wisdom the army has put 
everything on this case and now that it is running into 
difficulties the army leadership�s attention is bound to be 
distracted from other things.
    
On the morning after October 12 there was a clear choice before the 
army: (1) to assume the burden of government and in due course sink 
into the mud like previous incarnations of the military spirit or 
(2) to perform a quick act of surgery, cut its losses and leave it 
to the political process to mop up the blood from the floor and get 
on with the business of restoring the country to the constitutional 
path.
    
The first was the easy and ready-to-hand option; the second 
required a keen sense of judgement. True to our collective worth, 
the first option was chosen and the second not even considered and 
this is why, instead of soaring like the eagle and seeing things in 
totality from a distance, the country�s new rulers are stuck with 
their noses to the ground, involved in the nitty-gritty of everyday 
things. If this were a command and staff exercise those opting for 
this solution would have had some tough explaining to do.
    
But this is the real thing and not a mock exercise on a sand table 
and its tragedy is that any explaining will come later while the 
price of failure and confusion will be paid by the nation. When the 
Ayubs, the Zia-ul-Haqs, the Marcoses and Suhartos sit in state on 
their thrones they are immune from any questions. When they depart 
into the shades of history  with some of them as loaded with gold 
as the pharaohs used to be on entering their tombs  the wreckage 
they leave behind has to be cleared up by others. Often it is so 
great it has to be left where it is, poisoning both the soil and 
the atmosphere. Are we doomed to repeat this cycle for sins 
committed in an earlier life?
    
As an MPA in Punjab when Shahbaz Sharif was master of all he 
surveyed, I sometimes was invited to high-level meetings where the 
Punjab strongman (always very nice to me) used to ask my opinion 
about sundry subjects usually connected with law and order. Shahbaz 
was addicted to meetings and to setting up task forces for every 
subject under the sun. Once or twice I could not help telling him 
that he should take time out to sit by himself in the evening, lean 
his head back and try to see things in perspective. Whether he took 
my advice or not is beside the point. Apart from men of real worth, 
most of us, when caught in a rush, are unable to see the wood for 
the trees.
    
Commanding the Pakistan army, one might have supposed, was a full-
time job. But from Ayub Khan onwards, a succession of army 
commanders have obviously thought otherwise. Which is why like 
Faiz�s lover they have done a bit of this and a bit of that and 
ended by doing nothing well at all.
    
The situation is not much different today. General Musharraf too is 
in a rush: meetings, foreign visits, governance, reform, 
accountability, Sattar�s strange obsession with the CTBT and, in 
the midst of this confusion, trying to set, with the assistance of 
an inept team, a direction for his regime.
    
To move beyond the sphere of municipal administration and the 
removal of encroachments, twin activities to which the new order 
has taken with great zest, the military government must have a 
political plan. But it has none or at least none in sync with 
reality. At the same time, it is afflicted with a strong sense of 
infallibility which prevents it from thinking in terms of an 
orderly withdrawal. So, despite appearances, it is stuck on the 
same spot with the nation too condemned to mark time as it watches 
with tired eyes a familiar drama being repeated one more time.
    
Apology: Last week I put my foot in my mouth by saying Hindus and 
Muslims were two distinct �races� which was a sad and inappropriate 
choice of words. For this very sorry.

<a name="wher">Hijacking: where do we go from here?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shahid M. Amin

THE week-long hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane on Christmas 
eve, which so vividly gripped the attention of the peoples of the 
subcontinent in particular and that of the world media in general, 
is likely to cast a long shadow over Indo-Pakistan relations. Prime 
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has already come out with the 
extraordinary statement that the world community declare Pakistan a 
"terrorist state." This is unlikely to happen.

However, the very fact that such a categoric statement should have 
been made by the Indian prime minister shows the extent of the 
damage done by the events of the last fortnight to the already 
strained adversarial relationship between India and Pakistan.

Vajpayee has had the reputation of being a relatively cool-headed 
and moderate leader, notably in the context of Indo-Pakistan 
relations. When he first became foreign minister in March 1977, in 
a coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morarji Desai, he 
had shown a certain keenness to open a new chapter in the bitter 
long history of Indo-Pakistan relations. Thus, in February 1978, he 
became the first Indian foreign minister to undertake a goodwill 
visit to Pakistan.

Similarly, when Vajpayee became prime minister in 1998, one of his 
first acts was to meet a visiting Pakistani sports team. He later 
conducted the so-called "Bus Diplomacy" by visiting Lahore in 
February 1999 to sign the Lahore Declaration, which seems virtually 
defunct now. All that seems to have gone overboard and forgotten. 
An embittered and openly hostile Vajpayee has emerged. This could 
have ominous implications in the days ahead.

In fact, the most unfortunate part of last month's hijacking 
incident seemed to be that no voices of moderation were audible, 
either in India or in Pakistan. On the Indian television, the 
degree of anti-Pakistan feelings displayed by all alike - including 
top-ranking retired military officers and veteran diplomats - was 
both striking as well as depressing. Joining the fray with 
remarkable gusto and alacrity, the PTV had its own share of India-
haters. Indeed, both sides indulged in an astounding display of 
pathological distrust, suspicions and gross distortions in a 
competition to outdo each other in spitting venom and hatred.

During the course of the hijacking incident, the number of false 
allegations and misrepresentations made by the Indian side - both 
official and unofficial - were quite numerous. Some of them were 
promptly and effectively demolished by the Pakistani side and, in 
some cases, by Indian sources themselves. The allegations that the 
hijackers had arrived in Katmandu by a PIA flight from Karachi and 
had simply walked across to board the IA aircraft; and that one of 
the hijackers, a certain "Mr Qazi," was given four other tickets by 
the IA staff without specific identification. That the five 
hijackers included a Nepali drug peddler, who later actually turned 
out to be one of the hostages; and the disclosure of the "names" of 
the Pakistani hijackers - these were just a few among the many 
absurd charges made by the Indians which proved to be entirely 
fictitious.

Similarly untrue was the allegation that Pakistan had delayed in 
giving flight clearance to the Indian aircraft proceeding to 
Kandahar for negotiations. While these were, of course, factual 
inaccuracies of the various developments, much more disturbing were 
the constant allegations of Pakistani connivance with, or actual 
complicity in, the hijacking which were advanced without any valid 
evidence.

On the Pakistani side also, there were many apparent 
misrepresentations. In particular, the allegation that India itself 
had staged the whole hijacking incident and that the hijackers were 
RAW agents was advanced in all seriousness by certain official 
appearing on the PTV and in the Pakistani official media. A survey 
of Pakistani public opinion reportedly disclosed that 80 per cent 
Pakistanis believed that the hijacking was an Indian-staged show, 
carried out with the specific purpose of defaming Pakistan and 
having it declared a terrorist state.

The main evidence produced in support of this allegation was as to 
why the Indian authorities had allowed the IA aircraft to take off 
from Amritsar for Lahore. The other leg of this argument was that 
in 1971, India had staged a hijacking at Lahore which it had used 
as a pretext to ban the over flights between West and East 
Pakistan.

Demolishing the above theory was the fact that, at the end of the 
hijacking in Kandahar, it was India that came out as the net loser. 
It had to suffer the national humiliation of having to release, 
under duress, three key Kashmiri militants in order to secure the 
end of the hijacking. The mainly Indian hostages in the aircraft 
underwent the trauma of one of the longest hijackings on record, 
during which one passenger was killed and another badly injured. 
Also, the Vajpayee government came under biting criticism in India 
over the final deal with the hijackers and the handling of the 
whole affair. It had to negotiate with the Taliban regime which it 
had previously ostracized.

Another area of Pakistani criticism was that India had 
procrastinated over resolving the hijacking crisis and had thus 
shown callous disregard for the welfare of the passengers taken 
hostage. However, it is a well-accepted tactic in dealing with 
hijackers to delay matters with a view to exhausting the hijackers 
and weakening their will and physical stamina. 

Let it be said unequivocally that hijacking is an inexcusable and 
heinous offence that must be condemned not only in words but also 
by deeds. The world community is unanimous in opposing it. Those 
who hijacked the IA plane in order to secure their objectives in 
fighting the Indian occupation of Kashmir have ended up merely by 
tarnishing the Kashmir cause. As the saying goes, the road to hell 
is paved with good intentions. The Kashmir cause is hurt and not 
served by senseless acts of terrorism. This particular hijacking 
seems to have been the handiwork of the followers of Maulana Azhar 
Masood whose release from an Indian jail was the main demand of the 
hijackers, which they achieved.

There had been earlier attempts also to secure his release in which 
some innocent foreign nationals had been kidnapped and killed. 
Unfortunately, the fact that he is a Pakistani religious leader 
does in some way implicate Pakistan in this sordid affair. 
Therefore, it must be the endeavour of the Pakistani authorities to 
do everything possible to catch, try and punish the hijackers if 
they are found in Pakistan.

In the meanwhile, it must be sincerely hoped that Indo-Pakistan 
relations would not enter a new phase of crisis. The two countries 
are nuclear powers and need to act with the greatest sense of 
responsibility in averting conflict. There is need for both sides 
to think rationally and examine facts objectively without seeking 
to throw the blame on each other.

In India, there must be a realisation that its defective security 
arrangements, particularly at Kathmandu, were mainly responsible 
for the hijacking. Secondly, the inability or unwillingness to 
prevent the plane from taking off from Amritsar was a grave mistake 
that greatly weakened India's ability to handle the crisis from a 
position of relative strength. Hence, it is vain and perverse to 
blame Pakistan for the problems that actually arose out of India's 
own mishandling of the affair.

Similarly, the hawks in Pakistan need to remember that the present 
climate is the worst possible to fight a war with India. Even a 
conventional war would be devastating and must be avoided. Unlike 
the previous two wars with India, Pakistan can at present expect 
practically no help from outside. The country's economy is in dire 
straits and cannot sustain any protracted conflict. The agenda of 
the present regime in Pakistan is, and should be, to put the 
country back on its feet. This cannot be achieved if there is open 
conflict with India or even an arms race.

It should also be clear to any observer that there is no "give" in 
the Indian position on Kashmir. Recent discussions on Indian TV 
showed a singular lack of willingness on the part of anyone to 
reconsider the Indian position on Kashmir, even though this was 
clearly the main cause for the hijacking.

On the contrary, Indian opinion seems hell-bent on holding on to 
Kashmir. Under the circumstances, no progress in resolving the 
Kashmir issue seems to be on the cards. Therefore, insisting on 
putting Kashmir at the head of our foreign policy objective seems, 
at the moment, an unrealistic exercise.

Nations must learn to act within their means to secure attainable 
objectives. It is said that when Deng Xiaoping assumed full power 
in China, in the decade of 1970, he told his associates that China 
must work to secure that which was attainable and leave aside, at 
least for the time being, that which was not attainable. This could 
also be the best advice for Pakistan.

<a name="what">What's new, Charlie Brown? </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

ACCORDING to one old proverb, "Children and fools speak the truth"; 
according to another, "Children and fools have merry lives."

The children in the 'Peanuts' comic strip do both, but they are 
also subject to melancholy, disappointment and despair. In short, 
they reflect the human condition with its wide emotional spectrum. 
Day after day, these cartoon characters entertained and instructed 
millions of readers as the syndicated strip was published in 2,600 
newspapers around the world. The recent retirement of Charles 
Schultz, the creator of 'Peanuts' fifty years after he launched his 
lovable characters, will leave a big gap.

Charlie Brown, the hapless Everyman, is constantly at the receiving 
end of stinging barbs and snubs from the acid-tongued Lucy. In one 
memorable series, she balances an (American) football on the ground 
and invites Charlie Brown to kick it, only to pull it away at the 
last moment. Time after time, Charlie Brown charges up to the ball, 
only to be deceived and land hard on his backside. Linus, Charlie 
Brown's friend, asks him why he falls for the same trick every 
time. "Well", replies the victim. "I keep hoping that one day Lucy 
will keep her word."

Like Charlie Brown, the Pakistani nation keeps hoping that the army 
will keep its word and like the cartoon character, we keep falling 
on our collective backside. The messiah of the day repeats the same 
mantra his illustrious predecessors intoned earlier, and we duly 
applaud yet another unconstitutional intervention. It is only when 
the nation's rear end comes into contact with reality that we 
realize we have been tricked yet again. To be fair, the generals do 
not mean to fool us: they are as convinced as the rest of us that 
they can deliver. But as time goes on and things remain the same or 
get worse, the 'junta du jour' hangs in there, fooling itself that 
it is doing a better job than 'those damned civvies'.

Take the latest round of Pakistan's recurring bouts of military 
intervention: three months after he stepped in, all General Pervez 
Musharraf has to show for his efforts is a few businessmen and 
politicians in jail, eight billion rupees in returned loans and 
some new faces in power. All this is an improvement over the last 
government, but the price we have paid for cosmetic changes is far 
too high. There have been no radical changes, no departure from the 
trodden path. But expecting drastic reform from a basically 
conservative institution shows our Charlie Brown-like naivete.

The whole business of having a general in charge while maintaining 
a democratic facade is beyond me: the only possible justification 
for military rule is that freed from constitutional restraints, the 
administration can take drastic steps and cut through red tape. As 
it is, we have the worst of both worlds: on the one hand, we have 
lost the basic right to choose our government, while on the other, 
we do not have the benefits of quick decision-making the army is 
supposed to display.

A few examples will prove my point. Well over a month ago, the 
Chief Executive had proclaimed that the vexing question of 
independent power projects pricing would be resolved in 30 days. 
That deadline has come and gone without any solution in sight. 
Meanwhile, the verdict declaring interest to be un-Islamic has made 
any future foreign investments in Pakistan almost unthinkable.

One of the most appealing elements in General Musharraf's first 
address to the nation three months ago was his clear rejection of 
religious extremism of any kind. The Charlie Browns among us had 
hoped for some kind of firm action against the gangs of armed 
zealots that have increasingly infested Pakistan since General 
Zia's days. But far from calling them to heel, this government 
seems to have given them greater licence than ever before. In the 
aftermath of the Indian Airline hijacking last month, we have one 
of the released prisoners, Maulana Masood Azhar, going around 
threatening India and the United States with fire and brimstone 
without the government lifting a finger.

As it is, Pakistan has long stood accused of harbouring terrorists 
in our midst. After the hijacking, we had been thrown on the 
defensive by the barrage of accusations from New Delhi, but instead 
of acting circumspectly, we have added fuel to the fire by allowing 
Pakistani citizens to act in a flagrantly provocative manner. So 
much for the Chief Executive's liberal credentials.

And although this government's spokesmen have stressed its 
commitment to fundamental rights, people like Mushahid Husain and 
members of Nawaz Sharif's family continue to be detained without 
charges. Surely three months should be enough to determine whether 
there are grounds to prosecute or not. Just because Nawaz Sharif 
and his bunch of thugs treated opponents in this manner does not 
mean that those now in custody should be denied their legal rights. 
Two wrongs never made a right.

What is lacking is a clear sense of direction and purpose. Despite 
the calibre of some of the new team, we have received no signal of 
what the junta proposes to do with its unlimited powers. Basically, 
this government is doing what all its predecessors have done: 
muddling along. By refusing to take the tough steps, it is forgoing 
the possibilities that had briefly opened up three months ago when 
there was universal euphoria at Nawaz Sharif's overthrow.

We need to be clear that Pakistan's very survival now depends on 
reasserting the writ of the state; this in turn demands that the 
politics of violence should cease. To achieve this goal, the 
preachers of the gospel of hate and violence have to be strongly 
discouraged, and ethnic and sectarian armies disarmed. Given the 
organisation and the sophisticated arms they now possess, only the 
army is capable of carrying out this task. So instead of recovering 
defaulted loans and outstanding electricity bills, if our armed 
forces were to concentrate on the more difficult but essential task 
of restoring law and order, they would be making a genuine 
contribution towards bringing peace and prosperity to Pakistan.

But if they choose to fritter away the goodwill they still enjoy by 
carrying on with business as usual, it will not be long before 

people start asking them why they entered the fray in the first 
place. After all, even Charlie Brown will get wise one day to the 
fact that Lucy will never keep her word.

<a name="paki">Pakistan score sensational last-ball victory over India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISBANE, Jan 11: Saqlain Mushtaq and Waqar Younis scrambled a bye 
off the last ball to lift Pakistan to a thrilling two-wicket win 
over India here on Monday.

The eighth-wicket pair added 43 runs off 37 balls as Pakistan, 
replying to India's 195, fought back from the death to win the day-
night encounter in a nerve-wrecking finish.

Man-of-the-Match Yousuf Youhana hit 63 to help Pakistan recover 
from a disastrous 71-6 and post 196-8, their second win in two days 
in the tri-nation one-day series.

Wasim Akram's men, who stunned hosts Australia in Sunday's opener, 
ended the double-header at the Gabba with four full points. 
Pakistan won despite being given only 49 overs to bat by match 
referee Cammie Smith of the West Indies for a slow over-rate in 
India's innings.

"Saqlain and Younis have done it again," a delighted Akram said, 
referring to the pair's 57-run stand against Australia. "It shows 
that we fight all the way and don't give up easily. "I am not 
worried by the top order failing a second time. The main batsmen 
are too good to fail for long," Akram said.

India's new-ball pair of Javagal Srinath and Ajit Agarkar ripped 
through Pakistan's top order, before Youhanna added 49 for the 
seventh wicket with Akram and 333 for the eighth with Saqlain 
Srinath,  however, deceived Youhanna with a slower ball in the 43rd 
over which the batsman edged to the wicket-keeper and made Pakistan 
153-8.

Saqlain and Younis narrowed the gap with audacious hits, and left 
themselves 14 runs to get in the last two overs. They took eight in 
the penultimate over bowled by leg-spinner Anil Kumble, including a 
cut to the point boundary by Saqlain.

Needing six off the last six balls, the pair cobbled up three off 
the first four deliveries before Prasad sent down a wide from the 
fifth.

A single off the fifth legitimate ball ensured Pakistan a tie, and 
Saqlain and Waqar sealed a win with a bye off the last ball as 
wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe fumbled with the leg-side take. Saqlain 
remained unbeaten on 27 and Younis was 13 not out when team-mates 
rushed out to hug their unlikely heroes. It was Pakistan's first 
win over India in four meetings on Australian soil, and avenged the 
World Cup defeat at Old Trafford in June.

A disappointed Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar said the 43 runs 
conceded in the end proved too costly. "The bowlers did well at the 
start, but we could not finish it," Tendulkar said. "Last-ball 
finishes can go either way. We did our best, but Saqlain and Younis 
took the game away from us."

Shoaib Akhtar's lethal three for 19 appeared to go in vain as 
Pakistan found runs hard to come by against the Indians. Srinath, 
who finished with four wickets, and Agarkar rattled the top 
batsmen, before Youhanna led Pakistan's gritty fight back.

India, electing to bat after winning the toss, slipped to 77-4 
before Ganguly and Robin Singh added 66 for the fifth wicket. Left-
hander Ganguly, who opened the innings, made 61 before he was fifth 
out in the 40th over, bowled by Shoaib.

All-rounder Singh hit 50 off 84 balls, but India failed to register 
200 when they lost their last three wickets for one run. The lower 
order batsmen undid the good work by Ganguly and Singh as both 
Agarkar and Kumble ran themselves out attempting a second run.-AFP

<a name="shoa">Shoaib's return throws ICC in turmoil</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISBANE, Jan 11: The International Cricket Council (ICC) was 
thrown in turmoil yesterday after its stunning decision to allow 
banned Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar to return to international 
cricket.

Former Australian captain Bob Simpson, a member of the ICC's 
bowling panel, expressed his shock at the backflip on Shoaib after 
he was banned nine days ago for an illegal action when bowling 
bouncers or faster deliveries.

ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya of India on Sunday allowed Shoaib to 
play in the triangular one-day series against Australia and India, 
sparking unprecedented scenes at the Gabba yesterday.

The 24-year-old rushed from Perth at dawn in a secret cross country 
dash, arriving at the Gabba 12 minutes into Pakistan's day-night 
clash with Australia.

Dalmiya ruled that Shoaib should be allowed to play because 
bouncers were "no-balled" in one-day matches, effectively negating 
his problem with illegal deliveries. But Simpson admitted his 
surprise at the strange ruling from Dalmiya, insisting it was not 
just his bouncers which caused problems.

"I'm a little shocked about the whole thing," Simpson said. "Myself 
and the other members of the committee would like to see some 
answers coming through. "The view of the panel was that it wasn't 
just the bouncer, it was also his faster delivery, and it was 
unanimously agreed that this action needed remedial work. "I don't 
know what the ramifications will be."

Simpson said he had not been contacted by the ICC following the 
decision, but he had spoken with other members of the 11-man panel, 
who were equally shocked.

Dalmiya and ICC cricket committee chairman Sir Clyde Walcott 
reviewed Shoaib's action after the Pakistan Cricket Board lodged an 
appeal against the original decision.

Shoaib received a rousing reception when he was introduced to the 
sell-out Gabba crowed, acknowledging their support before he sent 
down his first over. Shoaib had been in Perth for the last week 
undergoing remedial work on his action, but dashed to Brisbane on a 
flight which left Perth at dawn and stopped over in Adelaide. He 
was jostled by media as he climbed out of a car at the Gabba while 
Pakistan were already batting against Australia.

"I just got the news last night at seven O'clock (Perth time). I'm 
thankful to my God, thankful to my team-mates. I'd like to thank my 
manager, my skipper and my board. They backed me up all the way. "I 
put all my faith in the board and the ICC and the Pakistan Cricket 
Board, and that's all I have to say at the moment," he said.-

<a name="acbb">ACB blasts ICC's backflip on Shoaib</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MELBOURNE, Jan 11: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has set 
"a dangerous precedent" in lifting the ban on Pakistan fast bowler 
Shoaib Akhtar, Australia's top official said on Wednesday.

Australian Cricket Board chairman Denis Rogers said he was worried 
at the procedure adopted to overturn the ban, and added his 
attempts to clarify the matter with ICC president Jagmohan Dalmiya 
had failed.

"I am worried about the processes involved and the precedent it 
sets," Rogers told a press conference here. "Vetoes are dangerous. 
And that's why I want to see how this process worked."

Dalmiya and ICC cricket committee chairman Sir Clyde Walcott 
cleared Shoaib to play in the tri-series against Australia and 
India, despite being banned by a nine-man committee dealing with 
bowling actions.

Rogers said he had no problems with Shoaib resuming his career, but 
was disappointed to see a decision by the specialist ICC committee 
overturned so quickly. "I don't understand the process involved," 
he said. "I'm happy to have it explained to me and I've left no 
stone unturned in trying to get in contact with Mr Dalmiya, but 
I've had no luck." Dalmiya, meanwhile, stood by his decision, 
saying the initial ban on Shoaib was unfair.

"We don't want to interfere with decisions taken by ICC committees, 
but there should be proper policy, principle and procedures 
followed," Dalmiya was quoted as saying during the ongoing under-19 
World Cup in Sri Lanka.

Rogers called for a "quick and efficient" policy to be put in place 
to enable cricket to deal with suspicious actions. The issue 
appears to be high on the agenda at the next ICC meeting in 
Singapore in February.

Rogers made it clear umpires should still have the right to call 
players for throwing, rather than refer them to the ICC's bowling 
committee. "We should never stop umpires umpiring," he said.

ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed, meanwhile, expressed his 
disappointment at Australia's top umpires defending themselves 
against allegations of racism and bias.

Speed said the umpires would not be punished for the outburst at a 
pre-series meeting of captains last week, but added their actions 
threatened their credibility. "Umpires have to make decisions 
without fear or favour," Speed said. "And a key to that is to be 
above the politics of the game." Speed, however, defended the 
performance of Australia's umpires, describing them as amongst the 
best in the world. "If any person suggests there is a degree of 
racism in Australian cricket then those persons should be held 
accountable," he said.-AFP

<a name="icct">ICC to take up Shoaib issue next month</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

COLOMBO, Jan 11: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will next 
month take up the issue of the ban on Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib 
Akhtar which was subsequently overruled, a report said on Tuesday.

The Daily News quoted visiting ICC President Jagmohan Dalmiya as 
saying that the allegations against the Pakistani bowler were 
unfair and not justifiable.

The report came as Australian officials said the ICC had set "a 
dangerous precedent" in lifting the ban on Akhtar, handed out for 
an allegedly illegal bowling action. However, Dalmiya said he and 
ICC cricket committee chairman Clyde Walcot acted after the 
Pakistan Cricket Board lodged an appeal against the original 
banning of Akhtar from international cricket.

"We don't want to interfere with decisions taken by ICC committees, 
but there should be proper procedures followed," Dalmiya said. "We 
have a new situation here and it will be taken up at the ICC 
meeting coming up on February 9 and 10."

Australian Cricket Board chairman Denis Rogers said he was worried 
at the procedure adopted to overturn the ban, and added that his 
attempts to clarify the matter with ICC president Dalmiya had 
failed.

"I am worried about the processes involved and the precedent it 
sets," Rogers told a press conference here. "Vetoes are dangerous. 
And that's why I want to see how this process worked."-AFP

<a name="razz">Razzaq inspires a 45-run win over Australia</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

BRISBANE, Jan 11: Shoaib Akhtar inspired Pakistan to a stunning 45-
run victory over Australia in the opening match of the tri-series 
here on Sunday.

Shoaib, reprieved by the International Cricket Council on Saturday 
from a chucking ban, marked his return with three for 31 that 
sparked a brilliant Pakistani fight-back. The 24-year-old speedster 
removed Ricky Ponting and skipper Steve Waugh off successive balls 
as Australia, chasing Pakistan's modest 184 for eight, folded up 
for 139 at the Gabba.

Michael Bevan remained unbeaten on 31, but could not prevent 
Australia from crashing to only the second defeat in their last 16 
One-day Internationals.

A sell-out crowd of 40,000 looked on in disbelief as the 
Australians, fresh from a 3-0 whitewash of both India and Pakistan 
in the Test series, slipped from 72 for two to 79 for seven.

Seamer Abdur Razzaq, who ripped through the middle order with three 
wickets in five balls, was adjudged Man-of-the-Match with four for 
23 from eight overs.

Flash bulbs popped in the stands as Shoaib thundered in for his 
opening delivery and received standing ovation from the crowd after 
the over. Shoaib found success with the second ball of his fourth 
over when Ponting edged an overhead catch to Mohammad Wasim at 
second slip.

Steve Waugh was trapped leg-before next ball, and even though 
Damien Martyn survived the hat trick delivery, there was little 
respite from Abdur Razzaq at the other end. The youngster had 
Martyn caught at point, forced Andrew Symonds to edge a catch to 
second slip and then bowled Brett Lee with a lightening delivery. 
Earlier, Symonds picked up three for 34 and leg-spinner Shane Warne 
two for 52 as the Pakistani top order gifted away their wickets.

Pakistan were reduced to 127 for eight, before Saqlain Mushtaq and 
Waqar Younis put on a defiant stand unbroken stand of 57 for the 
ninth wicket. Saqlain returned unbeaten with side's top score of 
37. Waqar made 23 not out, including a straight six off Glenn 
McGrath in the final over. Captain Wasim Akram hit 35 and vice-
captain Moin Khan 33, but none of the first six batsmen crossed 
12.-Reuters
