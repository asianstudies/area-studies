<a name="mush">Musharraf expects new pact with IMF: Economic documentation vital</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Habib Khan Ghori

KARACHI, Sept 15: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, has 
expressed optimism that Pakistan will reach an agreement with the 
IMF on a new loan facility within a month or two.

This he stated at a press conference on his arrival at the Quaid-i-
Azam International Airport at 4am on Friday. The CE had gone to New 
York to attend the UN Millennium Summit.

During his visit, said the CE, he had held talks with senior IMF 
officials. He, however, pointed out that "we are working on a long-
term strategy so that in future we don't have to run for seeking 
assistance from outside."

Disagreeing with a questioner that people had been leaving the 
country owing to the tax survey, the CE said he had been receiving 
about a thousand letters everyday but none had mentioned about it. 
Instead, he added, people had asked him to continue with the 
documentation of economy.

Referring to an agreement reached with traders, he declared: 
"Pakistan's survival lies in the documentation of economy and 
adoption of the tax culture."

People might be leaving for other reasons, but not for the tax 
fear, he remarked.

The CE stated that Pakistan's relations with the US should be 
viewed independently and it should not be hooked on to the US-India 
relationship. "We would maintain relations with United States 
independent of Indian relationship with them."

Terming his visit a success, he said he had projected Pakistan's 
point of view on global and regional issues, particularly on the 
Kashmir dispute, at the UN.

He referred to his meetings with 15 heads of the state, the 
breakfast meeting with Asia Society as well as his interaction with 
media. He said he had discussed the Kashmir issue with UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan "who was quite concerned about it."

The CE said that during this five-minute informal meeting with US 
President Bill Clinton at a reception, he (the president) had 
expressed "apprehensions over the problem and mentioned the US 
efforts to seek a solution to the Kashmir issue."

"I am glad that there is a realization among the world leaders 
about Pakistan's point of view for a peaceful solution to the 
Kashmir issue," said the general.

But Gen Musharraf said the road to a solution was not easy and for 
that there needed to be a successful dialogue between India and 
Pakistan.

He pointed out that the Hizbul Mujahideen had provided a window of 
opportunity, by offering a unilateral ceasefire, which could have 
been availed of by India but the negative response from Delhi 
wasted it.

He hoped that the Indians would show some statesmanship and take 
practical steps to resolve the dispute.

The CE ruled out any review of the scheduled local government 
elections on a non-party basis. The decision, he said, had been 
taken after in-depth discussions, for "we want the members of the 
local governments to look downwards to serve the masses instead of 
looking towards their party bosses. It is our considered opinion 
that this decision is in the interest of the country."

<a name="met1">Musharraf met 15 World Leaders in New York</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Sept 13: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, had 
met 15 world leaders on the sidelines of the recently-concluded UN 
Millennium Summit in New York.

The CE had met the presidents of Italy, Turkey, Algeria, Russia, 
Senegal, Iran, Sudan, China, and Comoros; King of Jordan, Amir of 
Qatar, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, prime ministers of Nepal and 
Bhutan, and the UN secretary-general, according to the foreign 
ministry sources.

Mandarins in the ministry were reluctant to reveal which countries 
had rejected Pakistan's request for such a meeting. "This is 
sensitive information," an official stated.

Another said the country's diplomatic wing in New York must have 
full information whom did they approach for Gen Musharraf's 
meeting.

Though none of those leaders have much influence in moulding global 
politics, observers attach great importance to the meeting between 
Gen Musharraf and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.

There was an effort by the Pakistan officials for a meeting between 
US President Clinton and the chief executive, but the two leaders 
could only have a brief informal chat at a reception.

According to a source, in normal circumstances one hardly cares for 
the number of such meetings at a multilateral forum. However, 
because of the peculiar situation Pakistan is facing in its foreign 
relations currently such meetings do have an impact. "Today 
Pakistan is facing big challenges and it is at the receiving end so 
it was required of it to show through these meetings that it has 
many friends around."

Because of hostile and unwelcoming circumstances after the nuclear 
tests and the Oct 12 military takeover, the foreign ministry 
officials feel that the routine diplomacy could not do much to 
improve the situation.

Policymakers tried to take maximum advantage of the millennium 
summit to attain the foreign policy objectives that are otherwise 
hard to chase.

The basic objective of the visit was to attend and address the UN 
summit, which, the government sources believed, had been achieved 
well as Gen Musharraf's speech at the General Assembly was received 
well, particularly his offer for a tension-free and nuclear-free 
South Asia.

Many were looking forward to the summit meeting for a Musharraf-
Vajpayee encounter but it could not happen "despite Washington's 
reported efforts in this respect".

On the contrary, the Indian Prime Minister's speech at the UN was 
very hostile towards Pakistan and it set conditions to the no-war 
pact offered by Gen Musharraf.

<a name="nucl">Nuclear capability of Pakistan well ahead of India: Qadeer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: Nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan claimed 
on Tuesday that Pakistan had more advanced nuclear capability than 
that of India and that all major cities of India could be 
obliterated within five minutes.

He was speaking at a function organized by the Orient Advertising 
Company to confer awards on outstanding science students.

Dr Khan said the statement of Chief Executive General Pervez 
Musharraf at the UN Millennium Summit had raised the morale of the 
entire nation.

He stressed the need for imparting modern education to the young 
generation so that it could face challenges of the new age.

He lauded the Orient Advertisement Company for encouraging talented 
students by giving them gold medals and cash prizes every year. He 
also announced a cash prize of Rs10,000 for 10 students of 
different universities each who were also awarded medals in the 
function.

Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said the private sector was 
supplementing government's efforts to increase literacy rate in the 
country and raise the standard of education.

He said that out of the total 260,000 students who passed matric 
examination in Karachi this year, 55 to 60 per cent had studied in 
private schools.

Those 10 MSc( physics) students who received gold medals and a cash 
prize of Rs10,000 each were: Afzal Hussain (Sindh University), 
Nousheen Akhtar Qureshi (Jamia, Karachi), Ambreen Jafer(Balochistan 
University), Maryum Fayyaz (Punjab University), Nadeem Ahmed Khan 
(Islamia University, Bahawalpur), Faisal Ahmed (Bahaudddin Zakaria 
University),Shahida Asif (Peshawar University), Mohammad Saleh 
(Shah Abdul Latif University), Yasir Jamil (Agriculture University, 
Faisalabad), and Shazia Aziz (Azad Jammu and Kashmir University).

<a name="scad">SC admits 15 pleas against NAB law: Larger bench to be formed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shujaat Ali Khan

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court 
admitted on Tuesday 15 constitutional petitions challenging the 
validity of the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance for early 
hearing by a larger bench.

Headed by Chief Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, it ordered that notices 
be issued to the Federation through the cabinet division and the 
federal law secretary and to the NAB chairman. Another notice was 
issued to the attorney-general under Order 27-A of the Civil 
Procedure Code as important questions requiring interpretation of 
constitutional provisions are involved.

The petitions were filed directly before the apex court under 
Article 184 (3) of the Constitution. The provision confers original 
jurisdiction on the court if the matter agitated involves 
enforcement of fundamental rights and is of public interest.

The petitions have been filed by ousted premier and NAB convict 
Mian Nawaz Sharif, GDA leader Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, NAP 
president Asfandyar Wali Khan, PPP leaders Hakim Ali Zardari and Ms 
Naheed Khan, Dr Farooq Sattar of MQM, NAB accused Asif Saigol and 
Hussain Nawaz, former petroleum minister Anwar Saifullah Khan, PML 
lawyer Zafar Ali Shah, Ghulam Qadir Jatoi, ex-MNA Chaudhry Sher 
Ali, Punjab Bar Council member Pir Masood Chishti and Syed Iqbal 
Haider of Muslim Youth Movement.

Advocates Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, Aitzaz Ahsan Chaudhry, Mohammad 
Akram Sheikh, Dr Abdul Basit, K.M.A. Samdani, Supreme Court Bar 
Association president Abdul Haleem Pirzada, Chaudhry Mushtaq Ahmad 
Khan, Zafar Ali Shah and M. Ikram Chaudhry and Mr Iqbal Haider 
pressed for the admission of petitions for regular hearing. Though 
not on notice, NAB prosecutor-general Farooq Adam Khan was present 
throughout the proceedings. AG Aziz A. Munshi and Senior Federal 
Minister Sharifuddin Pirzada also watched the proceedings for quite 
some time.

The admission order said the petitions have raised 23 questions as 
'matters of first impression'. They are of great public importance 
involving fundamental rights as ordained by Article 184 (3) of the 
Constitution. The ordinance has been assailed for being repugnant 
to the principle of the separation of powers and the independence 
of judiciary, freedom of trade, business and profession, security 
of person, safeguard from arrest and detention, protection from 
retrospectivepunishment, inviolability of dignity of man, freedom 
of movement, equality of citizens and other basic rights.

The order recalled that in the case of Syed Zafar Ali Shah and 
others versus Gen Pervez Musharraf, Chief Executive of Pakistan, 
and others, the Supreme Court had observed that the 'validity of 
the NAB Ordinance will be examined separately in appropriate 
proceedings at appropriate stage'.

The court made it clear that it would examine the question of 
validity of the impugned ordinance and not individual grievances 
raised by some of the petitioners directly or indirectly.

However, the petitioners shall not be debarred from pressing their 
pleas through appropriate proceedings before competentcourts. The 
SC admission order shall not operate as stay of proceedings before 
NAB, accountability courts or any other court in relation to 
matters arising out of the impugned ordinance.

<a name="plan">Plane case: Nawaz used authority, says prosecutor</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, Sept 14: The state counsel in Nawaz Sharif's appeal 
against his conviction in Oct 12 plane case, rebutted on Thursday 
before a full bench of the Sindh High Court, the appellant's claim 
on general exceptions and the question of delay in the filing of 
the FIR.

The full bench comprised Sindh High Court Chief Justice Saiyed 
Saeed Ashhad, Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany and Justice Wahid Bux 
Brohi.

As the state counsel argued his case the bench observed that in its 
view some of the cases mentioned by him in support of his plea were 
not important any more.

Arguing on Mr Sharif's claim that he was protected by law to order 
diversion of PK-805, the chief public prosecutor, Barrister 
Zahoorul Haq, contended that the plea in the appellate court was 
contrary to the appellant's statement on oath in the trial court.

He read out the entire statement of the deposed prime minister, 
which he had made before the trial court, in which he had denied of 
ordering diversion of the plane, blockade of runway as well as the 
airfield and had, among other things, claimed that since the start 
of the Kargil issue Gen Musharraf was playing hide and seek not 
only with him (Nawaz) but also with the army.

The counsel for the appellant, Barrister Azizullah Shaikh, 
interceded to state that it was not a written statement. Sindh 
Advocate General Raja Qureshi submitted that it was a written 
statement which was read out in the court.

At this point Justice Brohi asked the special public prosecutor if 
there was any record that it was a written statement.

Barrister Haq submitted that as far as he was concerned "if an 
accused takes a plea within the meaning of Article 121 of Qanoon-i-
Shahadat and the existence of that plea is grounded in the 
existence of fact, then the plea can be entertained only if 
compliance is made with Article 121 of Qanoon-i-Shahadat".

He submitted that if certain facts which were in the exclusive 
knowledge of the accused, it was all the more important that the 
plea was related to facts which could be exercised under Article 
122 of Qanoon-i-Shahadat. Referring to the probability of the 
existence of a plea, the state counsel contended that the accused 
must bring the facts to the knowledge of the court to convince it 
on that premise. At no stage, neither during cross-examination nor 
in statement by the accused under section 342, this plea was taken, 
he submitted.

In fact, he contended, the defence case at trial was of denial of 
allegations.

The chief justice observed: "Do you object to this plea. Why do you 
say he cannot take this plea? He has taken this plea on the basis 
of section 6. The legal question is whether he had this power? By 
taking this plea he has also absolved you of some of the problems."

Barrister Haq submitted that the appellant could take a new plea, 
and contended that it was the "ingenious approach" of the counsel 
but had no nexus with facts of the case.

The CJ held: "You are not clear Mr Zahoor, please consider the 
value of arguments of the defence side", and maintained that 
"according to the defence, Mr Sharif had exercised his 
constitutional powers when he retired Gen Musharraf. But when his 
constitutional authority was challenged, he resorted to action 
under section 6 of CA Ord, 1960".

Responding to the court observation, Barrister Haq said had the 
appellant exercised powers under articles 233/234 of the 
Constitution and issued notification, suspending basic fundamental 
rights, the balance could have tilted, but no action was taken by 
him till army came and took over the prime minister's house at 7pm 
on that day, he added.

"Do you think that suspension of fundamental rights is a lesser 
evil than diversion of a flight", observed Justice Brohi.

Barrister Haq admitted that the prime minister had powers under the 
Constitution and diversion of the plane was a sub- ordinate action. 
However, "besides judging the legality of law, the court has to see 
whether legitimate exercise of law, as claimed by the defence, was 
grounded in facts or not", he added.

Mr Haq read out the entire statement which the appellant had made 
before the trial court in support of his argument that the 
appellate court could only entertain the plea if there was any 
evidence on record to establish that the prosecution was wrong, or 
he had to produce evidence in support of his plea.

Owing to total absence of such evidence the appellant could not 
persuade the appellate court to come to a finding that a reasonable 
doubt had been created about the "probability" of his plea, which 
could have entitled him to the benefit of acquittal.

"If an accused person takes a plea that he is justified for 
acquittal then the court will presume the absence of such 
circumstances read with Article 161 of Qanoon-i-Shahadat and if the 
plea was germaned on or grounded in facts, then some evidence 
should be brought in the judicial filed so that the court can 
adjudicate on the issue," he submitted.

Since no such plea was taken or evidence was produced in the court 
and Mr Sharif denied the sending of PK-805 outside the country, 
therefore, the plea raised by Barrister Shaikh was "imaginary and 
not worth consideration" in support of the above proposition.

He cited a number of judgments in this regard.

The next limb of his argument was on delay in the lodging of the 
FIR. It was submitted that there was no delay as immediately after 
the incident, Gen Musharraf had come on television in the small 
hours of Oct 13, 1999 and had narrated the incident.

This was a reference to the chief executive's address in which he 
had stated that his life was put in danger with 198 persons on 
board.

Barrister Haq submitted that since it was a high profile case, 
involving important personalities, and the offence was spread over 
three cities, (Karachi, Islamabad and Nawabshah), and the accused 
were either located at Karachi or Islamabad, a thorough fact-
finding inquiry was necessary, not necessarily under the Inquiry 
Act, 1956, or the Criminal Procedure Code, but to ascertain facts 
of the case. Owing to this delay resulted in the lodging of the FIR 
by Col Atiquzzaman.

<a name="bena">Benazir's appeal hearing adjourned</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: A Supreme Court bench on Tuesday adjourned 
hearing of appeals of Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari against 
their conviction in corruption charges.

An Ehtesab bench of the Lahore High Court, consisting of Justice 
Malik Qayyum and Justice Najmul Hasan, on April 15, 1999 had 
sentenced Ms Bhutto and Zardari to five years' imprisonment each, 
and imposed a fine of $8.6 million.

The court had also disqualified them as members of the parliament 
and ordered for confiscation of their property.

In its verdict the Ehtesab bench had held that the pre-shipment 
inspection contract to a Swiss company, SGS, was awarded by the 
former prime minister "alone" at the behest and with the abetment 
of Mr Zardari.

The verdict of the bench is in the field as its operation has not 
been suspended by the Supreme Court.

The appeals were adjourned on the request of the state which sought 
time to prepare the case and engage a counsel. The counsel of the 
appellants, Farooq H. Naik, opposed the adjournment for indefinite 
period.

On Tuesday when the five-member bench, headed by Justice Munir A. 
Sheikh, took up the appeals of Ms Bhutto and Zardari, the deputy 
attorney general, Tanveer Bashir Ansari, requested for adjournment 
of their hearing.

The court room was packed to capacity as all the important leaders 
of PPP from all over the country were present there.

The bench consisted of Justice Munir A. Sheikh, Justice Nazim 
Hussain Siddiqui, Justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal, Justice Javed Iqbal 
and Justice Hamid Ali Mirza.

The DAG stated that Ali Sibtain Fazli advocate was engaged for 
appearing in the case, and he had gone to the US. He further stated 
that despite efforts having been made, Mr Fazli could not be 
contacted.

The DAG further stated that on account of voluminous record of the 
case a senior counsel would be engaged and for that some time was 
needed. He prayed the court to grant "some reasonable time" for 
proper preparation of the cases. "As such on account of these 
reasons it will be in the interest of justice that these cases of 
general public importance be adjourned for a month," he stated.

Mr Naik opposed the adjournment request and said that the cause 
list had been issued about a month ago and the state was fully 
aware that the case would be taken up on Sept 12.

He said the request for adjournment was, in fact, an attempt to 
delay the disposal of the appeals. He asked the court to turn down 
the state's request.

The court, however, adjourned the proceedings for indefinite 
period.

<a name="poli">Political activities to remain banned, says Moin</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: The interior minister Moinuddin Haider on 
Tuesday said the ban on political activities will continue till the 
implementation of seven-point military government agenda.

Talking to newsmen here at a function organized by the Orient 
advertising agency, he said the Supreme Court had given timeframe 
to the government for completing its agenda and till that time all 
political activities will remain suspended.

Mr Haider said no one would be allowed to hold rallies and public 
meetings during the course of forthcoming local bodies elections.

He said the government felt that these political parties created 
law and order situation and spoiled peace by staging rallies and 
demonstrations.

Responding to a query about former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif 
andBenazir Bhutto and political activities of their parties, he 
said: "No mercy would be given to both Nawaz and Benazir for 
continuing political activities as their cases are yet to be 
decided by the courts," he added.

Answering to a question, the minister rejected an impression that 
the people of the country had disappointed by the military 
government and said spreading such rumours among the people of the 
country was a propaganda of west and India to create unrest and 
instability in Pakistan.

He claimed that the government was heading towards reforms and 
pointing out ills of society.

<a name="notr">No trials for '71 debacle, says CE: It was a political failure also</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, Sept 11: Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf said 
here on Sunday that the 1971 tragedy was not only a military but a 
political debacle as well.

He made these remarks in response to a question about Hamood-ur-
Rehman Commission report at a press conference here on Sunday.

"Let's forget the bitterness of the past and move forward," he 
said.

In answer to a question whether there would be trials as 
recommended by the report, Gen Musharraf replied tersely, "No, 
certainly not. Something happened 30 years ago. Why do we want to 
live in history? As a Pakistani, I would like to forget 1971."

He added, "What happened then is nothing that any of us can be 
proud of. It was a debacle, not only a military but a political 
debacle. But why do we want to dig the past up?"

The chief executive said: "as for the Hamood report, there was a 
vested interest involved there. The mandate given to the Commission 
by the man who appointed it was to look into the military debacle 
in East Pakistan. Why did it not look into the political debacle?"

"It is known who was responsible for it, the very man who ordered 
the inquiry. I think this issue needs to be closed. It is dead. 
Let's forget the bitterness of the past and move forward."

Gen Musharraf also laid to rest rumours that the national assembly 
would be revived. "That is not going to happen," he stated 
emphatically. He made light of the suggestion that after the 
retirement of the present president and the restoration of the 8th 
amendment, he would step into his shoes. "I have not decided 
anything about that yet. I haven't even thought of it," he said.

Responding to a question about the repatriation of stranded 
Pakistanis in Bangladesh, he replied that though it was a matter of 
great regret to him that they were in the plight in which they 
were, this was not the right time for a decision on this issue. "I 
do not add to our difficulties. We have enough of them as it. This 
is not the time for it."

Gen Musharraf was asked about the process of accountability which 
the question suggested left something to be desired. He replied 
that he did not possess a "magic wand" but things were moving and 
they were moving in the right direction. Everyone was accountable. 
There will be no exceptions.

He rejected a suggestion that the devolution system he was giving 
the nation was a re-run of Ayub's system of Basic Democracies. He 
said the two had nothing in common. Told that after the fall of 
Ayub, his system was thrown out, might that not happen to his 
system also when he was no longer around, he replied that if the 
system was good for the people, they would not permit anyone to 
discard it.

He declared that the National Accountability Bureau was not weak. 
"Bear with us," he added, "Nobody is out of the list." He said 
there were going to be no exemptions.

Asked about Osama bin Laden, he said while he understood that he 
was an "important American concern", he was not a Pakistani 
problem. He said he had advised the Americans to engage with the 
Taliban. He had also said that Pakistan would do what it could to 
"facilitate" things but we had nothing to do with Osama. "I cannot 
solve that problem," he stated, adding that Pakistan would like 
peace to return to Afghanistan and a commonly acceptable government 
established.

<a name="appe">Appellant banned from entering court: SC storming case hearing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Sept 14: A five-member Supreme Court bench, on Thursday 
stopped appellant Shahid Orakzai from entering the court premises 
for a period of one month, or till the conclusion of the hearings, 
so as to avoid any obstruction in the ongoing proceedings of the 
apex court storming case.

The order was passed by the five-judge bench, headed by Chief 
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, and comprising Mr Justice Bashir Hassan 
Jehangiri, Mr Justice Sh. Riaz, Mr Justice Ch. Muhammad Arif and Mr 
Justice Munir A. Sheikh.

The bench is hearing an appeal, filed by Mr Orakzai, a journalist, 
over the decision of a three-judge bench. The case was started when 
leaders and workers of Pakistan Muslim League allegedly attacked 
the Supreme Court building, where a bench headed by then Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, was hearing a contempt of court case 
against the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

On Thursday, Attorney General Aziz A. Munshi stated that an earlier 
conclusion drawn up by a three-member bench of the SC needed to be 
reviewed. He had been asked by the court on Wednesday to give his 
opinion, on whether the conclusions drawn by the three-member bench 
of the SC on the same issue were correct, or were based on 
misleading evidence.

The AG stated that people identified by witnesses in their 
statements, should have been asked to explain the purpose of their 
visit to the court on November 28,1998.

He said that Saifur Rehman, former chairman of the Ehtesab Bureau 
was seen by many witnesses, but the court did not issue him a show 
cause notice. Similarly, Tahir Khaili, political secretary to the 
then prime minister, was also identified by the witnesses, but he 
too was not summoned.

He suggested that the people who were identified, but were not 
issued show cause notice, should be asked to explain the purpose of 
their visit.

The AG also submitted a synopsis of the incriminating evidence. 
After reading the synopsis, the AG said that the court, which had 
came to the conclusion that grossest contempt of court had been 
committed, should have tried the people for the offence.

The CJ, however, did not agree with the proposal that more 
witnesses should be summoned, and asked the attorney general to 
confine himself to the existing respondents.

The AG read out from the evidence that Saifur Rehman was spotted in 
the Supreme Court building along with his supporters. The AG 
requested the court to allow DAG, Tanveer Bashir Ansari to read out 
the evidence.

The DAG read out the statement of Zahid Hussain, journalist, Altaf 
Bhatti, and Fakhr-ur-Rehman. After reading the evidence, the DAG 
requested the court to summon witnesses like Saifur Rehman and 
Mushtaq Tahir Khaili.

When the DAG said that it was a case of contempt of court at the 
face of the court, the CJ said it was not like that. The CJ further 
said that Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was right in saying that slogans 
against the judiciary were tantamount to contempt of court.

In his concluding remarks, Aziz A. Munshi said that his anxiety as 
prosecutor was to point out the lacunas in the earlier judgment of 
the court.

He said that he was not making a request for summoning more witness 
to settle his personal scores, but was doing so for upholding the 
dignity of the court.

When the court invited Shahid Orakzai to address the court for ten 
minutes, Mohammad Ali Sayeed, counsel for Pakistan Muslim League, 
said that Orakzai had no right to address the court. He said Mr 
Orakzai had himself committed grossest contempt of court.

When Shahid Orakzai was finally allowed by the court, he was told 
that whatever he wanted to say, he should say in ten minutes.

Mr Orakzai said that he should be told in plain words what the 
court wanted to do with him. The CJ explained that the AG, 
prosecutor in the case, had concluded his arguments.

Shahid Orakzai asked the court to grant him time as he wanted to 
consider the option of withdrawing his appeal. When the court asked 
him to sit down, Mr Orakzai said that there was no question of 
sitting down in the court room. In the same case, the SC bench in 
which the sitting CJ was member, had allowed him to speak for two 
days, he stated.

The court explained that under the contempt laws, if contempt of 
court was pointed out by somebody and the court took cognizance of 
that, then it was between the court and the contemner.

Shahid Orakazi said that nobody, even the court, was above the law 
and he was guaranteed equal treatment under the constitution.

At this the court invited the attorney general and asked him to 
ensure that he be prevented in future from obstructing the 
proceedings of the case.

The court rose about twenty minutes before the scheduled time, and 
announced that it would like to see the video film made on the 
closed circuit TV system.

After one hour, the court announced the order which is as follows:

"The learned Attorney General for Pakistan has concluded his 
arguments in the titled appeal. In order to give the hearing to Mr 
Shahid Orakzai, who had moved an application against the impugned 
order of a three-member bench of this court and which application 
had been turned into an appeal, he was allowed to address the court 
for ten minutes. He rose from his seat and took the rostrum. He 
started with irrelevant matters. He was stopped to refer to any 
such matter which has no nexus with the determination of the point 
involved. He became enraged and started misbehaving. It is not the 
first time that he has behaved in this manner. His conduct has 
always been to brow-beat the court in such like matters. He is in 
the habit of remaining in attendance in all such cases in which he 
has no interest nor he has ever been a party to such proceedings.

We have, therefore, decided that Shahid Orakzai should be stopped 
from entering the court premises for a period of one month or till 
the conclusion of the case, whichever is earlier, so as to avoid 
any obstruction in the course of justice. This is apart from any 
action that we may deem proper to take against him. Order 
accordingly.

We direct the learned Attorney General for Pakistan and the 
Inspector General of Police, Islamabad to take appropriate steps 
for ensuring compliance of this order.

<a name="hasi">Hasina again calls for Pakistanis' trial</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DHAKA, Sept 14: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed 
called on Thursday for Pakistanis allegedly involved in war crimes 
in 1971 to be brought to trial.

"Pakistan must seek forgiveness for their atrocities and this is 
not only our demand, but the world's conscience," Sheikh Hasina 
said at the end of a six-day session of parliament.

"The trial of war criminals must take place, as unless they are 
tried, how can there be peace?" she asked.

Sheikh Hasina's comments came as ties between the two countries 
apparently strained after Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf 
cancelled scheduled talks on the sidelines of the UN Millennium 
summit in New York.

The snub was linked to a speech given by the Bangladeshi leader at 
the United Nations Security Council criticizing military regimes.

"My speech at the UNSC is a matter of principle ... I have spoken 
about my ideals and people are the source of all power, not 
weapons," Sheikh Hasina said.

She added it was "nothing new" and "I don't know why he took it 
upon himself".

The premier said Gen Musharraf should have known about her 
principles as "I have always been against military regimes".-AFP

<a name="debt">Debt-servicing claims 50pc of revenue, says Musharraf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Sept 10: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, 
assured the Pakistani expatriates that his government would improve 
the economic and political situation by introducing "irreversible 
sustainable reforms".

In his speech at a gathering on Saturday, he detailed his economic 
and fiscal reforms, democratic reforms, devolution plan; and his 
plan to root out corruption, restore law and order, provide justice 
and, above all, to promote and protect women's rights.

He, however, admitted that it's not easy to introduce reforms and 
change the culture of corruption and decadence in Pakistan.

Gen Musharraf made it a point to tell the audience that the 
responsibility to run the country had been thrust upon him. "I was 
happy being a soldier. I was pushed into this position, and I know 
by whom."

He said there were mismanaged decaying government institutions, and 
all the state-run institutions or corporations were in financial 
crisis whether its PIA, railways, Wapda, KESC, Steel Mills, or 
National Shipping Corporation. "They have been badly run and 
mismanaged."

Although the CE's speech ran an hour and half, people sat silently. 
He said he was pained every day when international lending 
institutions came to Pakistan to see "our books and tell us how to 
introduce reforms".

Pakistan's debt trap, he pointed out, was such that 50 per cent of 
the revenues went towards debt servicing. He stated that almost all 
public corporations were overstaffed by thousands which was 
hampering their ability to run profitability.

"People tell me if you want to get rid of them, (then) why don't 
you give them a golden handshake as if the money grows on the 
trees."

Referring to charges that his government was moving very slowly to 
arrest and convict corrupt politicians and businessmen, h said the 
wheels of the due process of law moved slowly. "We cannot take law 
in our own hands and give arbitrary judgments." He said the 
campaign to document the economy was going smoothly after an 
agreement with traders.

Later, Gen Musharraf moved among the crowd of 1,000 who had come to 
see him much to the chagrin of the US Secret Service. After half an 
hour of mingling, the security succeeded in stopping the general 
from moving in the crowd.

According to reports out of the 150 world leaders who came to 
attend the UN Millennium Summit, Gen Musharraf received fifth 
highest security detail.

GAS PROJECT: The CE related a hilarious incident about the proposed 
Iranian gas pipeline which would run through Pakistan into India.

The Pakistan government has approved the project as requested by 
the Iranian government.

<a name="badg">Bad governance, fall in revenues main causes, says World Bank</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 14: The World Bank said on Thursday that "bad 
governance" and fall in revenues were responsible for increased 
poverty in Pakistan.

"The performance of successive governments in Pakistan had been 
disappointing due to bad governance ... that ultimately increased 
poverty in the country," maintained John Wall, WB's director for 
Pakistan and Afghanistan. "There has been deterioration in revenues 
and governance".

Speaking at the launching of the World Development Report 2000-2001 
Attacking Poverty here on Thursday, he said the situation in '50s 
and '70s was good as there was eradication of poverty to a good 
extent. "But in '90s things were bad due to bad governance".

He was asked, by a participant, why there was no poverty 
alleviation in Pakistan despite the WB's considerable funding, 
particularly for the social action programme, Mr Wall said that 
there was no serious shortage of funding and that sufficient 
resource allocation had also been made available but still things 
did not work in the past.

The WB's country chief said that Pakistan's total budgetary 
resources were 15 per cent of the GDP. "Out of this, 5pc goes into 
civil administration, 4pc to defence and the rest to debt 
servicing. And (therefore) nothing is left for development 
purposes," he elaborated.

He stated that governments could not run their affairs with just 
15pc of the GDP and that there was a need to increase revenues.

He pointed out that if much resources were put in for development 
purposes, it would increase the budget deficit. Therefore, he 
added, there was a need to balance the resources and their spending 
in various sectors.

Mr Wall said that SAP was a great disappointment and as it did not 
significantly contribute to eradication of poverty. He stressed the 
need for giving serious thought to uplift the social sector.

Poverty in South Asia, he said, was a serious problem which needed 
to be removed by taking important decisions. "I am worried about 
children in Pakistan. Weaker groups have no voice and no security," 
he said, adding that there was a need for radical changes to divert 
resources from infrastructure projects to social sectors, specially 
health and education.

Mr Wall called for inducting women in the elected bodies to 
increase their influence and capacity to work for improving the lot 
of a common man. "Increasing revenues are not enough but to use 
them efficiently is very important," he stressed.

In reply to a question, Roberto Zagha, a senior WB director in 
Washington, said that corruption was a worldwide phenomenon which 
was a big impediment to growth. He called for simplification of 
taxes.

Ms Tara, another WB official, was of the view that there was a need 
to seize the opportunity to address poverty in Pakistan. She hoped 
that the world development report would offer recommendations to 
deal with the issue. The report urges broader approach to reduce 
poverty and "opportunity, empowerment and security" have been cited 
as crucial themes to effectively meet with the situation.

According to the WB president, James D. Wolfensohn, the report 
seeks to expand the understanding of poverty and its causes, and 
sets out actions to create a world free of poverty in all 
dimensions.

Reuters adds: Mr Wall said it was unclear if poverty, which has 
showed a moderate decline for South Asia as a whole in the past 10 
years, actually increased in Pakistan during the decade.

World Bank figures show 55pc of Pakistanis over the age of 15 are 
illiterate. Infant mortality in the country of nearly 140 million 
people stands at 91 per 1,000 births - 10 times the level of 
wealthy countries.

<a name="imfr">IMF reviews budget targets, real economy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: The World Bank and the IMF are expected to 
jointly offer $1.35 billion medium-term programme to Pakistan to 
help improve its balance of payments position.

Sources toldDawn here on Tuesday that the World Bank had joined the 
IMF for talks with Pakistan on a number of important issues, 
including assessment of the possibility of jointly extending 1.35 
billion dollar medium-term programme.

Talks between the two sides continued on Tuesday. The Secretary- 
General, Ministry of Finance, Moeen Afzal, led the Pakistan team 
while Ms Sena Ekin led the IMF review mission. Although the mission 
was reviewing budgetary targets set for 2000-2001, there were 
indications that Pakistan was likely to be offered around one 
billion dollar standby arrangement (SBA) by the IMF on a 6 per cent 
mark-up. And the World Bank would approve 350 million dollar 
structural adjustment loan (SAL).

The sources said Pakistan had been given to understand that, under 
the present circumstances, Fund officials might not be able to 
offer the much-sought- after 2 to 2.50 billion dollar poverty 
reduction growth facility (PRGF). They said that Pakistan needed to 
settle some political issues with G-8 countries, specially on CTBT 
and Kashmir; and that once some broad understanding was reached, 
specially with the United States, this medium- term 1.35 billion 
dollar programme could be converted into PRFG.

The discussions focused on monetary sectors, balance of payments 
and real economy. "What are our reserves at present, what is the 
current money supply position and what is our interest rate policy- 
are the issues which came under discussion today", said a senior 
official of the ministry of finance.

<a name="othe">Other pledges linked to reforms: IMF may meet year's deficit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, Sept 13: It is unlikely that the IMF will deny "oxygen" to 
Pakistan but the worry now is about the size and form of the 
financial package.

Sources here said the Fund is expected to provide short-term credit 
facility and debt relief by Paris Club is to be of similar tenure. 
Apparently, IMF wants to keep Islamabad under pressure so that it 
does not drag its feet on stipulated reforms, they added.

The review mission led by Ms Sena Eken, assistant director, Middle 
Eastern Region, is currently evaluating fiscal reforms. It will be 
joined by Paul Chabrier, director, Middle Eastern Region this week.

The Article 1V consultations and a programme enjoying IMF support 
are to be finalized by the 20th of this month. Financial approval 
is anticipated at the meeting of the Fund's executive board, 
expected by the end of this month. Disbursements are likely to 
start in second quarter of current fiscal.

The reported agreement on Hubco power tariff while the crucial 
talks with IMF are underway, financial analysts say, has 
significantly improved the prospect of financial assistance. 
However, the IMF package which will encompass debt relief by Paris 
Club, sources say, would however be just enough to overcome the 
balance of payments deficit for one year.

Indications are that IMF bail out will be in the shape of 12 to 18 
month Standby Arrangement (SBA) that is designed to take care of 
balance of payments problems which are temporary or cyclical in 
nature. Payments are made on quarterly basis, on meeting of certain 
performance criteria and successful completion of programme 
reviews.

Though the general expectation is that IMF would provide one year 
facility of about a billion dollar, financial analysts at Global 
Securities (GBS) estimate that "an SBA to the tune of 500-700 
million dollars is likely to be approved by the IMF, accompanied by 
one to two year foreign debt rescheduling."

Analysts do not see a large IMF bail out for a variety of reasons. 
Incorrect reporting of fiscal data has been a major setback and the 
Fund has to be fully satisfied with the new reporting system, apart 
from execution of fiscal reforms and achievement of revenue 
targets. Perhaps more importantly, IMF shareholders are unlikely to 
approve a large bail out package without making Pakistan more 
receptive to their political agenda.

Whereas short-term facility will help address immediate balance of 
payments difficulties, a more long term package accompanied by a 
four to five year rescheduling will be required to put the external 
account in order, say financial analysts.

The IMF financial approvals would however send positive signal to 
both multilateral donors and commercial banks and enhance the 
country's credit rating. To quote press reports, the World Bank and 
Asian Development Bank may further strengthen the IMF support by 
simultaneous announcements of their loans.

Ihtashamul Haque adds from Islamabad: The IMF review mission held 
its first meeting with Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz on Wednesday 
and he assured the mission that the government would achieve 
economic indicators set for year 2000-2001 including reduction in 
budget deficit from 7 per cent to 5 per cent of the GDP.

<a name="self">Self-Assessment Scheme announced: Tough conditions laid down</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Sept 12: Sources of income and capital investment will 
have to be declared by all taxpayers to qualify for filing returns 
under the Self-Assessment Scheme (SAS), according to new rules 
introduced by the government on Tuesday.

The new rules, announced through Central Board of Revenue Circular 
No 21/2000, dated September 12, also disqualify people, who are 
required to be paying sales tax but are not registered with the 
Sales Tax Department, from availing this facility. This condition 
is for those, whose sales are taxable and are required to be either 
registered, enlisted or enrolled under Sales Tax Act, 1990.

These and other tough conditions, which are unprecedented under a 
scheme meant to facilitate taxpayers and to offer them immunity 
from extensive probes, have been envisaged to make the income-
taxpayers with undeclared wealth, capital, property, and other 
assets, either get their assets and sources whitened through Tax 
Amnesty Scheme, or face disqualification from paying tax under SAS, 
said CBR officials.

They also explained that the persons who get their assets and 
sources whitened through TAS, would have to declare through SAS-
2000 only those assets and sources for payment of tax, which are 
not declared through TAS. However, they will have to fulfil all 
other conditions laid down under the SAS-2000.

The conditions envisaged in the scheme and its scope is as follows: 
SAS-2000 applies to returns of income filed under section 55 of the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 for the assessment year 2000-2001, other 
than those mentioned in paragraph No 4 of this circular.

Returns filed for the assessment year 2000-2001 shall qualify for 
acceptance, under the scheme provided that following conditions are 
fulfilled: return is filed voluntarily by the due date and tax 
payable with the return under section 54 of Income Tax Ordinance, 
1979 has been fully paid and proof of such payment is attached with 
the return.

All cases, where income declared consists of or includes any income 
chargeable under the head "salary", and such income constitutes 
more than 50% of total income declared for the year.

<a name="rs57">Rs575 million sanctioned for task</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 10: The National Database and Registration 
Authority claimed on Saturday that it would hand over the fresh 
electoral rolls "as per schedule" to the Election Commission of 
Pakistan despite the fact that only two days ago it had told the EC 
that the electoral lists of 18 districts could not be completed 
before Sept 25.

NADRA was supposed to hand over the electoral lists of 18 districts 
to the EC by Sept 11, but on Thursday it sought two more weeks' 
extension.

In a letter sent to the chief of the EC, NADRA stated that because 
of certain "technical problems" it could not hand over the 
electoral rolls by Sept 11 and had sought two weeks' extension.

As a result, the EC had to issue a revised schedule for the 
verification and filing of objections on the electoral rolls.

A press release issued by NADRA on Saturday said the task would be 
completed on Sept 11. It added that the EC had sanctioned Rs575.68 
million for the task.

"NADRA will spend this amount on the updating and printing of new 
electoral rolls and special arrangements for the issuance of ID 
cards by the mobile teams. 

 "National Database and Registration Authority will also provide 
necessary hardware for the computerization of the Election 
Commision after the completion of current activities. 

 "Besides, NADRA will provide all the necessary data of voters to 
the EC at no extra cost," it added.

For printing of electoral rolls, a sum of Rs280 million had been 
approved by the cabinet, out of which Rs220 million had been 
requisitioned for the printing of required copies of electoral 
rolls for over 60 million voters.

<a name="acco">Accord reached with Hubco on tariff</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Sept 11: The government and officials of Hubco reached 
what is being termed a "comprehensive and workable" agreement on 
the price structure acceptable to Wapda, informed sources here told 
Dawn.

Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf, who was very anxious that an 
agreement with Hubco be reached before he left New York, had met 
the officials of the international power company on Sunday morning 
asking them to show flexibility.

He is expected to make the announcement of a comprehensive 
agreement in Islamabad on his return from the US.

"The agreement would create an atmosphere conducive to healthy 
investor-government relationship," said an official. Hubco was the 
last international power producer holdout and the World Bank 
officials had stressed that an agreement with IPPs was essential to 
jump-starting relationships between US investors and Pakistan.

The broad-based agreement was worked out in a meeting between 
finance minister Shaukat Aziz and the Hubco officials late on 
Sunday night and it will be signed, sealed and delivered in 
Islamabad.

The meeting on Sunday evening was attended among others by chairman 
of Hubco, Mehdi Alireza, Eric Salegi of Entergy, Ashraf Tombi of 
Xenal group, an official of National Power group and the managing 
director of Hubco.

A source told "Dawn" that a technical and legal framework worked 
out between Government of Pakistan (Wapda), and the law enforcement 
agencies will be drawn out as soon as possible.

Mr Aziz who refused to comment on the report of the agreement said 
that the meetings between Pakistani officials and the Hubco 
management was held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere.

Islamabad Burea adds: The Chairman of Hubco, has called upon chief 
executive Gen Pervez Musharraf to complete the process of law by 
investigating corruption charges against the company.

According to a press release of Hubco, its negotiating committee 
including Mr Alireza met the CE in New York on Sunday. The meeting 
was facilitated by Pakistan's ambassador to the United States at 
the request of Hubco.

In the meeting, Hubco's chairman urged Gen Musharraf to address the 
fundamental principles of international commercial laws that Hubco 
has put on the table to create a climate in which tariff 
negotiations can be successful. Those principles include: due 
process of law (the completion of the corruption charges); the 
right to international arbitration and the sanctity of contracts.

Mr Alireza emphasised that these principles will not only set the 
stage for a resolution of Hubco dispute, but will also send right 
message to the foreign investors in Pakistan. He urged the CE to 
take a leadership role in moving the process forward, as it is the 
belief of the negotiating committee that without the intervention 
of the CE, the dispute will linger indefinitely.

Mr Alireza also expressed his desire to resolve the Hubco dispute 
in a manner that recognizes the financial needs of the country, 
while also addressing the rights of Hubco shareholders.

<a name="talk">Talks held with IMF on cutting deficit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 11: A six-member IMF review mission held a second 
round of talks with finance secretary Moeen Afzal here on Monday to 
discuss a host of issues, including how to increase revenues, 
exports and reduce debt burden as well as budget deficit.

Informed sources told Dawn that the leader of the mission, Sena 
Ekin expressed satisfaction over the steps and 'unpopular' 
decisions taken by the government to improve the economy.

In this behalf she particularly lauded the efforts taken to 
increase the number of taxpayers from one million to 1.2 million by 
December this year. She believed that the ongoing tax survey 
campaign and tax amnesty scheme would considerably increase the 
revenues.

The finance secretary, sources said, briefed the mission about the 
latest economic situation by saying that the government did not 
want to hide any thing from the lending agencies and that it would 
take time to see the real economic revival. "All the technical 
details wanted by the mission were provided to it by the secretary-
general", a source said. He added that the Fund members were told 
that complete transparency was being adhered to and that efforts 
were being made to computerize the whole revenue collection system.

In this behalf the recommendations, being finalised by the task 
force on CBR restructuring, also came up for discussion. The 
recommendations would be submitted to the government in December. 
The task force will hold its second meeting from Oct 27 to 29 and 
in November at Karachi by co-opting the independent experts and 
economists.

Both sides also discussed the issues of low exports, precarious 
balance of payment position, and huge debt burden. According to an 
official, foreign debt has reached to over $33 billion and that 
Pakistan desperately needed support of the lending agencies to 
manage its financial affairs.

<a name="govt">Govt striving to earn forex through exports</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 15: Minister for Commerce and Industries Abdul Razzak 
Dawood said on Friday that a special policy for boosting dates 
export through value addition will be announced next month.

Speaking as a chief guest at 2nd Dates Show 2000, Karachi, which he 
later inaugurated, the minister said the country badly needs 
foreign exchange which could only be earned through higher exports 
and this was also the only way which could help reduce dependence 
on world donor agencies like IMF.

Dawood said that the economy was not strong because of heavy debt 
burden and for reducing this the way out is to increase exports to 
optimum level. And if we fail in doing so, he said, we as a nation 
would not get rid of IMF and other world agencies.

He said the government gives top priority to textile as it annually 
earns over $5 billion and have drafted 'Textile Vision 2005' to 
meet the challenges of phasing out of quotas in the year 2004.

In second stage, he said, fruits and vegetables will be taken up as 
a study with the help of SMEDA and EPB is being prepared to 
identify problems and bottlenecks in way of boosting exports.

He disclosed that a meeting of all the stakeholders including 
growers and exporters of vegetables and fruits has been arranged 
for Oct 2, with the Chief Executive to consider the chain of 
valuation addition of these produces.

Initially, Dawood said that four fruits, kinoo, dates, mangoes and 
apples have been identified for encouraging value addition through 
modern system of processing, packing as well as advertising. This 
will help boost exports of the produces.

The government, he said, would give incentives and try to remove 
weakness for boosting exports of these produces including dates 
which have much higher potential of earning foreign exchange from 
the present level of $23.9 million.

Abdul Razzak Dawood said: "I would admit that our growers have done 
their job by creating huge surplus in major crops like cotton, 
wheat, rice, onion, potato, fruits as well as in vegetables but on 
account of some weakness on our part the country could not properly 
benefit from these achievements."

He said, export culture has to be developed by involving every 
segment of economy, may it be a grower or direct or indirect 
exporter. He said in the past 'we only talked about exportable 
surplus but now we have to export whatever was in demand in world 
market and should not worry about domestic shortages.'

The minister that there was great demand of dates in Indonesia and 
during a recent visit of their commerce minister he was informed 
that dates are not being exported from Pakistan.

He disclosed that on Oct 18, he will be going to Indonesia taking 
along with him some exporters and growers of dates which will have 
to be exported ahead of the month of Ramazan.

<a name="rupe">Rupee declines on debt payment </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Sept 15: The rupee lost 13 paisa against US dollar in the 
inter-bank market on Friday as Pakistan made a debt payment of $20-
$25m through state-run banks. More debt payments are due in the 
remaining days of this month.

Senior bankers said the rupee closed at 54.85 to a dollar down 13 
paisa against the previous close of 54.72. They said the rupee 
touched a low of 54.92 earlier in the day as two state-run banks 
started purchasing dollars for debt payment.

But once the buyings were over the rupee regained part of its lost 
strength -and finished at 54.85. Bankers said despite a 13 paisa 
rise in the price of the dollar there was no panic from the 
importers-and forward rates remained stable.

In open market the rupee shed five paisa to close at 57.35 and 
57.45 for spot buying and selling against the greenback. On 
Thursday also the rupee had lost 10 paisa.

But whereas the decline of the rupee in the inter-bank market was 
because of debt payments its fall in the open market was for other 
reasons.

"People are holding stocks of sterling because of its ongoing slide 
against the dollar," said president of Forex Association of 
Pakistan Malik Muhammad Bostan. 

"This has slowed down conversion of sterlings into dollars by 
Pakistani money changers in Dubai. Hence a fall in dollar supplies 
in Pakistan."

<a name="imft">IMF to study revenue collection plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Sept 10: A crucial meeting between the IMF experts and 
the Central Board of Revenue officials will be held here on Monday 
to examine the board's claim that it would collect Rs100 billion 
additional revenue through documentation of economy.

Official sources told Dawn here on Sunday that the CBR would brief 
the IMF experts on the "potential to be tapped on the basis of 
survey of sales and incomes."

The Fund has been repeatedly asking the CBR to substantiate its 
claim about the additional revenue.

The survey aims at detecting the tax evasion by the existing 
taxpayers and those who are not on tax department books.

Sources said the CBR chairman and members of the income tax, sales 
tax, central excise and customs department, would brief the experts 
in this regard.

The briefing, they added, would be based on three aspects of the 
data collected so far on the income and expenditure of the 
residential sections. The business section survey data is being 
pooled for analysis.

The Fund officials would be briefed on a benchmark set by the CBR 
for analyzing the income on the basis of utilities bills of each 
household.

According to the benchmark a household can spend 15 per cent of its 
total income on the utilities. "If a household is spending Rs15,000 
a month on utilities, its income should unmistakably be Rs100,000, 
which should be declared through tax return. If the person is not a 
taxpayer he would have to get himself enlisted on the tax book, and 
a notice in this regard would be sent to him", a senior CBR 
official said.

The experts would also be briefed on the assessment of income on 
the basis of residential spaces declared in the survey forms. The 
IMF has already demanded a detailed study in this respect.

The Fund experts would also be given the information provided by 
the household about their vehicles, which is currently being 
analyzed for detecting the amount of misstatement of income 
committed by the taxpayers. On the basis of these aspects, CBR 
officials said, the IMF experts would be informed as to what 
methods would be applied for determining the tax evasion, and the 
procedure for extracting the evaded amounts from the declarants.

NNI adds: Meanwhile the visiting IMF mission will open formal talks 
with finance ministry officials on Monday on variety of issues, 
focussing on expected stand-by loan. The secretary-general, 
finance, Moeen Afzal, will be heading Pakistani team.

The government is confident to reach an agreement with IMF for the 
revival of defunct ESAF/EFF under a new mechanism, as most of the 
strings, including levying of GST, agriculture income tax, 
reforming tax regime, settlement of most of IPPs issue, curbing 
corruption and revival of sick units, have been met.

Sena Eken, head of the mission, met finance secretary Younus Khan 
on Saturday and discussed economic indicators. They reviewed agenda 
of talks.

The head of internal finance, additional finance secretary Riazul 
Haq and the IMF review mission also worked out detailed agenda of 
the meetings that are expected to continue till Sept 20.

<a name="kse1">KSE 100-share index falls by nine points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 15: Stocks finished the weekend session further 
shaded but unlike the previous sessions investors covered positions 
on selected counters anticipating some positive news on the Hubco 
front by the next week. The KSE 100-share index fell about nine 
points at 1,555.07.

Although trading was dominated throughout the day by alternate 
bouts of buying and selling by jobbers and weakholders but a late 
burst of short-covering in some pivotals demonstrated that bulls 
are back in the market.

"The late strong selective support was largely anticipatory 
apparently based on some positive news from the Hubco and IMF 
fronts", stock analysts at W-E Financials basing their comments on 
a possible press briefing by the chief executive Gen Pervez 
Musharraf after his return from New York.

Any news from the top could give the needed push to the market, 
which is almost "yearning for an instant stimulant to pull it out 
from the current impasse", the say.

After testing the recent peak index level of 1,600 points, the KSE 
100-share index managed to hold on to its most of the weekly gains, 
only shedding 22 points on Hubco-inspired selling, analysts at the 
KASB & Co say and that, "reflects its inherent strength".

"News from the Hubco front were not that bad as its management has 
indicated to revise downward its tariff rate, the proposed cut 
already conveyed to the government, a section of speculators made 
them look so", said a leading stock broker.

However, strong buying at the dips in it reflects that a formidable 
section of investors is not worried over the recent developments 
after the meetings at the highest levels to sort out the issue.

"The rigid position taken by the top Hubco management shows the 
process of give and take has already been set in motion and it is 
matter of time to see positive outcome", he says. The Hubco 
management has demanded withdrawal of all cases including relating 
to corruption before final settlement of the issue.

Analysts said investors have already digested the impact of 
negative news from it as the early week euphoria has turned into 
hasty selling and most of them leading brokers have already cleared 
their positions. "But what now worries them are reports of probe 
into the accounts of eight leading brokers to ascertain" whether or 
not they are in order" after the expiry of stipulated date of Sept 
15", they added.

What action the Securities & Exchange Commission takes if the share 
transaction accounts of them are not in order continued to depress 
prices of some leading shares sharply lower, a member of the KSE 
says. He says report released by the Securities & Exchange 
Commission on the last May stock market collapse followed by 
default of some members pinpoint that erring members also worked 
against the sentiment amid fears of official action against them.

On top of it was the weekend selling as both short-term investors 
and day trader liquidate positions at the available margins pushing 
prices further lower.

Minus signs again dominated the list as leading shares as a number 
of leading shares finished with an extended fall under the lead of 
Alico, Babri Cotton, Nishat Chunian, Sapphire Fibre, falling by 
Rs1.50 to 1.90.

<a name="gena">Gen Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan - 3</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

TO the credit of the man, it must be said that Yahya Khan never 
denied responsibility for the part he played in the dismemberment 
of Jinnah's Pakistan. He made this admission on many an occasion, 
as well as to the Hamoodur Rahman Commission. The final sentence of 
Major-General Rao Farman Ali Khan's book 'How Pakistan Got Divided' 
reads: "A far as Yahya was concerned, the Commission stated that he 
had accepted responsibility for everything."

The people of Pakistan stand guilty of having denied him an open 
trial, which he never ceased to ask for. But he died unheard. 
Bhutto took over what remained of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
on December 20, 1971, and Yahya was thereafter held virtually 
incommunicado in various locations until freed by Zia in 1977. By 
that time he was paralyzed, having suffered a stroke.

Hamoodur Rahman, from Lahore on January 11, 1972, addressed a 
letter to Yahya informing him that the Commission would be sitting 
as of January 17, and that "we would soon be needing your version 
of these historic happenings during which you were the head of 
state, head of government, Chief Martial Law Administrator, C-in-C 
Army and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces." Yahya was 
requested to ensure that "your statement is delivered to the 
Commission not later than Monday, 24th January 1972." With the 
letter was an eight-page questionnaire.

In his reply, Yahya wrote: "I have today (18 January, '72) received 
letter no-6-ICW/72 from Mr Justice Hamoodur Rahman, the Chief 
justice of Pakistan. I am located at the Forest Dak Bungalow, 
Banni. I am required to give my statement not later than 24 Jan 
'72. I would like to make it clear at the outset that I have no 
access to any records of the Central Government or General 
Headquarters to give details of events or exact dates, etc. of the 
various events."

Twenty-three typed pages follow, the closing sentences reading: 
"This briefly ends my narrative of the events of the past two and a 
half years which stated earlier is all I can produce from Memory. 
The other items given in Annexure A of your letter no. 6-ICW/72 
dated 11 Jan '72, if not already covered in the narrative, will 
require the study of documents of the Central Government, Ministry 
of Defence, and General Headquarters to which I have no access at 
the moment. I would welcome any clarification which is to be sought 
on any point that I have mentioned or may not have mentioned, but I 
would like to make it clear that any more answers or statements 
required of me will need the availability of those documents and 
the presence of many functionaries of the government, both civil 
and military, who were associated in these events with me."

Many swansongs have been written and read. Worthy of reproduction 
are certain excerpts from the book, 'Bhutto - a political 
biography' by Salman Taseer, an intelligent pro-Bhutto Pipian. 
According to Taseer, his book was banned by Zia. On the Hamoodur 
Rahman report:

"After the conflict was over, bhutto commissioned a report on the 
entire Bangladesh episode from Mr Justice Hamoodur Rahman, Chief 
Justice of Pakistan, and himself a Bengali. Bhutto testified before 
the commission whose sessions were held in camera throughout, but 
he never published the final report, arguing some parts of it could 
embarrass Pakistan in its conduct of foreign that some parts of it 
could embarrass Pakistan in the conduct of foreign relations. His 
detractors preferred to suggest that Bhutto never dated issue the 
report because he was so heavily implicated in the political 
chicanery and blundering that preceded the country's break-up. That 
may be so. But it is equally likely that the Hamoodur Rahman 
commission report was by no means the final word on political 
responsibility for the catastrophe that overcame Pakistan. 
Considering the circumstances in which the commission worked, its 
final report may even have erred in Bhutto's favour.

"Blame can never be satisfactorily or finally apportioned to the 
major players in this grisly drama, but that Bhutto, Mujibur Rahman 
and Yahya Khan share responsibility there can be no doubt. Many, 
indeed, are inclined to the view that Bhutto, as the most sure-
footed politician of the three and thus the best equipped to assess 
the consequences of his actions, must accept the lion's share of 
the blame. Argument on this point will remain one of the central 
themes of Pakistani politics, perhaps for decades."

Comments on Bhutto's political nature:

"After the election the situation changed drastically. Bhutto now 
saw that Mujibur Rahman with his majority of seats could form a 
government even without support from West Pakistan. And yet he was 
not the man to play second fiddle. With control of only two 
provincial governments out of five, he saw his position as far from 
assured." [As for playing second fiddle, I myself have heard him 
say: 'I'd rather be the top dog of half of Pakistan than an 
underdog of the whole of Pakistan.']

"Perhaps another politician with more moral scruple and with 
greater respect for democracy would have bowed before the will of 
the majority and quietly entered the Constituent Assembly to debate 
the future of Pakistan. Bhutto, however, possessed none of these 
gentle characteristics. He never had much faith in the 
parliamentary process."

"There was another danger in convening the Assembly. It was quite 
possible that a number of elected members from West Pakistan would 
give way to the Awami League's dominant position and compromise 
with them, enabling Mujibur Rahman to get the two-thirds majority 
needed to pass the constitution. Bhutto could not trust his own 
party, which consisted of a motley group of individuals, some of 
whom he barely knew and who had been swept into power on a wave of 
pro-Bhutto feeling."

On Bhutto's speech made on February 28, 1971, at public meeting at 
Lahore, where he offered Mujibur Rahman a carrot in the form of 
three alternatives - agreement on three of the Six Points, or 
postponement of the National Assembly meeting, or a waiving of the 
Legislative Framework Order.

"After the carrot, he them threatened the stick. The latter part of 
his speech was possibly the most belligerent he had ever made. He 
threatened a strike from the Khyber Pass to Karachi - 'not a single 
shope would be allowed to remain open.' He promised that the people 
of Pakistan would take full revenge from anybody who attended the 
Assembly session when they returned from Dacca, or, as he expressed 
himself, he 'would break their legs'. In spite of Bhutto's three 
alternative conditions, Sheikh mujibur Rahman refused to budge."

On Bhutto's role in the break-up:

"In such a central and traumatic event in Pakistan's existence, 
Bhutto has long been under suspicion over his role. he proved a 
voluble defendant and some would certainly argue that he protested 
rather too much. From the time of the army crackdown he 
compulsively sought to justify himself, reiterating Mujib's 
secessionist stance, the blunders of previous politicians and his 
own record in arguing East Pakistan's economic exploitation."

Now to skip forward thirty years. Our troubles are far from over. A 
self-confessed born-again Muslim, a former chief of the Inter 
Services intelligence, Lt-General Javed Nasir, now retired but 
holding a high position in the present government, is one of the 
several retired generals, admirals and air marshals who have taken 
to writing in the national press. I quote from his column, 
'Possibility of a nuclear war' (The News, September 7, 2000):

"It is immaterial who initiates the nuclear war; the end result in 
either case will be the same. In this mutual mass suicide, the 
casualties are going to be in hundreds of millions on both sides. 
The world will not even have enough vultures to clear the carrion.

"The rest of the world will receive doses of radiation from the 
fallout in quantums which will be hundreds of thousands times more 
than what some European countries experienced from Chernobyl. Time 
is running out. India has not shown any respect for international 
commitments in the past. It will not behave differently in the 
future. USA, G-8, and the rest must act, and act quickly, before it 
is too late, if they want to save the billion-plus of South Asia 
and the rest of the world from a nuclear holocaust."

<a name="ones">One step forward: how many steps back?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

CARE to know the foremost achievement of General Musharraf's 
October Revolution? What would have appeared impossible, perhaps 
inconceivable, ten months ago has come about with astonishing ease: 
the gradual rehabilitation in the public eye of the duo whose 
benign presence has defined Pakistani democracy these past fifteen 
years: Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif.

When the October tide ebbs - as in the fullness of time all mortal 
things must - the people of Pakistan will still be stuck with these 
twin symbols of Athenian democracy. All the world's lawyers could 
not have revived Ms Bhutto's plummeting fortunes. Nothing else 
could have preserved or rekindled the Raiwind clan's popular 
support. But if there has been any turnaround in public opinion, 
the Montgomerys and Mansteins of the army deserve all the credit 
for this happy outcome.

This makes Pakistan's future pretty clear: just as the October 
Revolution started from elementary school, the Pakistani nation, 
when this chapter in its colourful history draws to a close, will 
begin once again from where the Sharifs and the indispensable Ms 
Bhutto (now and forever Life Chairperson of the PPP) had left off. 
Talk of the curse of Sisyphus, lifting a stone to the top of a 
mountain and then, the stone rolling down, having to begin all over 
again. The Pakistani nation could teach Sisyphus a thing or two.

How has this miracle of revival occurred? The answer can be 
delivered in a single phrase: the confusion and maladroitness 
besetting the titanic steps of the October Revolution. Let's be 
honest. The people of Pakistan can be the greatest chumps on earth. 
With a complete sense of self-surrender they have suffered fools 
and impossible adventurers throughout their short history. They 
could have done so again provided they had got something, what the 
doctors call instant relief, during the last eleven months. But 
their plight has only worsened. That is why, getting over the 
euphoria excited by the advent of the October Revolution, they are 
committing the unthinkable: looking back nostalgically at the 
twosome who turned all notions of governance in Pakistan into a 
standing joke.

What hope are the Lilliputians in this landscape entertaining? The 
Tahirul Qadris and the Imran Khans? The people of Pakistan would 
have to be a lot more foolish than they are to fall for these 
heroes. Under what illusions are the so-called Chaudries of Gujrat, 
an appellation which makes me reach for my gun? In a king's party, 
singing to the tune of the October Revolution, they can figure big. 
That's what they and their family have done throughout their 
political lives: dine in style at the table of authoritarianism. 
But when the ongoing banquet whetting their appetite is over, they 
will be reduced to their proper level: the district of Gujrat.

How full of complaints the Chaudries are of the Sharifs? Of how 
they were denied the chief ministership of Punjab, as if Punjab is 
a kept woman waiting to be taken by every second-rate politico in 
the land. Where were these would-be conquerors of Punjab doing when 
the Sharifs were all powerful? No insult was too big for them to 
swallow then. No squeak escaped their wisdom-laden lips. The way 
Saifur Rehman made a mockery of Chaudry Shujaat's interior 
ministry, even a lesser man in his place would have thrown his 
resignation in Nawaz Sharif's face. But not Shujaat who was doing 
then what he and Pervez (a name of some account in the October 
Revolution) are doing now: protecting their investments.

Just consider Punjab's luck. First the Sharifs. Then Manzoor 
Wattoo. Now the Chaudries with their eyes on its future. In which 
other province could such raw talent have sprung? Lest I forget, 
even His Holiness the President, symbol and face of our puissant 
Republic, is from Punjab. And I say all this as a born-and-bred 
Punjabi - transfixed by the trophies hanging in Punjab's hall of 
fame. Think of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and of the two Lawrences who 
administered Punjabi affairs after the British annexation, then 
take Shujaat Hussain and Pervez Ellahi and you get an idea of what 
Punjab has come to in these promising times. It is the height of 
irony then for pseudo-nationalists from the other provinces to 
accuse Punjab of exploitation. Punjab has been ravished by its own. 
It deserves compassion not abuse.

After all this, what? Not the deluge. That would be something to 
look forward to. After this, back from where we started, back to 
the stone of Sisyphus. Back to the buffoons whose ghosts one might 
have been forgiven for thinking had well and truly been laid to 
rest.

This is what comes from interrupting the political process. The 
army, when it comes stamping into the political arena, always 
thinks it will construct a brave new world. It does nothing of the 
sort; only ends up blocking political evolution and adding to the 
sum of popular frustration. How many times are we fated to walk the 
same road?

What is the difference between us and western societies? We have 
been in thrall to despotism and arbitrary rule throughout our 
history - kings and emirs ruling by whim, subject to no checks and 
balances. Western societies over the last 500 years have evolved 
structures which in time have led to the death of arbitrary rule 
and the advent of personal freedoms and the rule of law. The milieu 
thus created has favoured learning and the spread of knowledge. If 
those societies have forged ahead and now rule the planet, it is 
because of superior know-how and no other magic.

If it was just a question of money, the Arab kingdoms and emirates 
would be in the forefront of the world's nations. But they are not 
because highways and tall buildings alone do not make for 
development. Knowledge does which (with apologies to Pakistan's 
Professor Oppenheimer, the publicity-crazy A. Q. Khan) we are 
without. Nigeria and Indonesia have plenty of oil. So does 
Venezuela. What have they done with it?

Strapped for cash, we are touching the IMF's feet for a pittance. 
But we were not strapped for cash during the Zia years. What did we 
do with the millions then flowing into our coffers? Not even a 
trace of that bonanza remains. A lot of it went into private hands, 
to finance the lifestyles of the rich, just as a lot of Nigerian 
and Indonesian and Arab wealth has gone the same way. We put all 
our skill and charm in international beggary. For institution-
building, which is what counts in the long term, we have no talent 
at all.

In New York the Revolution's Guide, when asked whether he would 
become president said, "I have not decided anything about that yet. 
I haven't even thought of it." Which means that the decision to 
become president or not rests on nothing institutional: it is his 
to take. During the same press conference he also said, "I have no 
desire to stifle the press although some of what is printed in 
Pakistan would justify stifling it ten times over." Again note the 
forbearance on offer. If the press has not been stifled it is no 
thanks to any laws but because of the sweet will of the Chief 
Architect.

This is a page right out of Muslim history. Too much despotism and 
arbitrariness; too few checks and balances.  	

TAILPIECE: The heart of every Pakistani should swell with pride on 
seeing the newspaper pictures of the American ambassador presenting 
the keys of six Datsun double-cabin pickups to the Inspector 
General, Frontier Corps, a Major-General Tajul Haq. On this 
occasion the ambassador termed Pakistan's narcotics control 
programme a great success. A few weeks ago a smiling Ms Sisson from 
the American embassy was giving medals and cash awards to stern-
looking members of the Anti-Narcotics Force. Now comes this king's 
ransom: six Datsun pickups. No one can accuse Pakistanis of being 
hard to please.

GENERAL Musharraf's refusal to meet Sheikh Hasina Wajid, the 
Bangladeshi prime minister, in New York recently came as a rude 
shock to those of us who thought relations between our two 
countries were cordial.

Just last month she had sent a personal envoy to the Pakistani 
Chief Executive with an offer to mediate in the dispute between 
Pakistan and India. The sudden freezing of relations occurred 
because in her speech at the UN General Assembly, Sheikh Hasina had 
suggested that action should be taken against military regimes that 
overthrow elected governments. Although Pakistan was not directly 
mentioned, our diplomats took umbrage and presumably advised 
General Musharraf to 'postpone' the planned meeting with the 
Bangladeshi prime minister.

Big mistake. The fact is that military juntas and coups d'etat are 
now very unfashionable, and the latest one in Pakistan was 
universally condemned. Indeed, we were thrown out of the 
Commonwealth, and yet its secretary-general was given a red carpet 
treatment when he came calling recently. If we are so touchy about 
Sheikh Hasina's remarks at the UN, then surely we ought to have 
snubbed the Commonwealth secretary-general. The fact is that in 
today's scenario, we need all the friends we can get instead of 
distancing ourselves from the few we do have left.

Both regionally and globally, we are more isolated today than ever 
before, and this is not just because the generals have taken over. 
A number of policies spanning the last two decades have contributed 
to our current isolation. Turn by turn we have offended friends and 
refused to stay in step with the far-reaching geopolitical and 
economic changes that have been sweeping the globe. As a result, we 
are virtually alone in the world today.

Ever since Pakistan's creation 53 years ago, we have been 
preoccupied with the threat we perceived from India, and virtually 
our entire foreign policy since then has been directed towards 
neutralizing this threat. To some extent, this was and remains a 
legitimate concern: every state has the right and the duty to 
protect its frontiers. But this preoccupation has become the be-all 
and end-all of successive governments, and support on Kashmir is 
the yardstick by which our relations with other states are 
measured.

Our Afghan policy was largely driven by the concept of 'strategic 
depth' dreamed up by General Zia who saw a grateful and pliant 
Afghanistan becoming a sort of client state that would give 
Pakistan the kind of defensive depth denied us by geography. After 
the soviet pull-out, we have continued playing favourites in the 
subsequent civil war that has devastated our neighbour for the same 
elusive goal. By our open-ended support of the Taliban, we have 
antagonized Iran, a traditionally close friend. The fallout of this 
policy has also caused deep resentment in the Central Asian 
Republics - countries that we had hoped to engage in lucrative 
commercial deals.

The efforts of well-heeled religious groups to export militant 
Islam and to support Islamic movements elsewhere have not been 
kindly received abroad. The Russians are furious with us, accusing 
us of sending armed militants to help the rebellious Chechens. 
While we may well sympathize with the embattled Chechens, the fact 
is that sending armed men will naturally be seen as a hostile act. 
The Chinese are upset over the activities of Pakistani 
fundamentalists in Xingjiang where Muslim separatists are waging a 
low-intensity struggle for their own homeland. The recent lethal 
explosion in Urumqi has been attributed to them. And although these 
actions have largely been undertaken by private groups and 
militias, the Pakistan government has been perceived as turning a 
blind eye to these hostile and subversive elements.

The nuclear devices that were exploded two years ago did not add to 
our international popularity either. Granted that they were 
triggered by India's earlier tests, the fact is that we had a real 
opportunity to occupy the moral high ground and isolate our 
neighbour by foregoing testing at that time. The rewards for such a 
bold act of statesmanship would have been large, but Nawaz Sharif 
had neither the vision nor the courage to seize the moment. The 
result of our knee-jerk reaction to the Indian tests was 
international condemnation, the disastrous freezing of foreign 
currency accounts and its resultant loss of confidence and 
crippling economic sanctions.

Kargil was a defining moment for Pakistan in many ways. Internally, 
the brief but bitter fighting had the effect of driving a wedge 
between the army chief and Nawaz Sharif, and led inexorably to the 
latter's ouster. But externally, the fallout was equally severe: 
the world saw Pakistan as an irresponsible nation that put regional 
security at nuclear risk by launching a military adventure without 
provocation. And when the perceived author and executor of the 
Kargil plan took power through a coup, Pakistan was well and truly 
in the doghouse.

Right or wrong, the world now sees Pakistan as a dangerous country 
that has nuclear capability and is governed by irresponsible 
leaders; a country where armed militias roam around under different 
religious banners without being stopped by the government; a 
country where women and the minorities are second class citizens; 
and a country where neither local foreign currency accounts nor 
foreign investments are safe.

Indeed, our isolation is not just diplomatic: the way the previous 
government and this one have mishandled the Hubco issue has made 
Pakistan a bad word in international financial circles. Here is a 
showpiece power project - one of the largest in the private sector 
anywhere - that is financed by a consortium of prestigious 
multinational banks and guaranteed by the World Bank that has been 
vilified and squeezed for the last three yeas and its executives 
treated like criminals. Although General Musharraf had promised 
that the problem would be resolved in a month soon after he took 
over, the fact is that after endless meetings, the only concession 
the company has received is that criminal charges against its 
officers have been withdrawn. How the government expects any 
foreign investment after all this is difficult to understand. The 
signal that has been sent out is that contracts and agreements have 
no sanctity in Pakistan, and courts here will side with the 
government to the extent of not permitting international 
arbitration.

By our own actions and policies, Pakistan is now isolated as never 
before. But instead of recognizing this and doing something about 
it, we behave like a flock of ostriches, content to bury our heads 
in the sand.

<a name="sydn">Sydney Olympics 2000: Ahmad Alam to carry flag at opening ceremony</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zawwar Hasan

 SYDNEY, Sept 12: The skipper of the Pakistan hockey team, Ahmad 
Alam, will carry the national flag at the opening ceremony of the 
twenty-seventh Olympiad on Friday at Stadium Australia, which 
promises to be a symphony of music and motion never witnessed 
before.

To be asked to lead the national contingent in the massive parade 
of the first Olympics of the new millennium is a singular honour 
for the 28-year-old Alam. More than that it symbolizes the nation's 
hope to see the hockey squad unfurl the green and white flag with 
its waxing crescent and star on the mast at the victory stand.

How serious the hockey squad is to come up to the nation's 
expectations can be sensed from the fact that only Alam, who has 
been honoured to be the national flag-bearer of the Pakistan 
contingent, will be at the four-hour parade. The other ten hockey 
players, chosen to play against Canada the next evening, will give 
a miss to the parade. The rest of the hockey squad along with its 
officials will march with the Pakistan contingent.

Talking to Dawn, Manager Islahuddin said: " The boys know they will 
miss history and a sparkling spectacle. However, winning an Olympic 
medal is more important to them. Skipping the parade would leave 
them fresher for their match against Canada. The players have 
settled for watching the ceremony on a TV screen in the comfort of 
the Olympic Village."

Islahuddin shrugged off the concerns in some quarters that Pakistan 
may not end its medal drought on its 13th appearance in the 
Olympics. With a loud laughter he quipped: "I do not believe in 
such superstitions. In fact, they challenge us to do better. Well, 
why don't they consider the fact that the Sydney Olympics starts on 
an auspicious Friday?"

<a name="cric">Cricket Squad for Kenya not finalized yet</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 11: The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 
Lt Gen Tauqir Zia on Monday said the skipper and coach of the team 
would be consulted before finalizing teams for future assignments.

He also said that team manager would not be part of the team 
selection committee during tours or series' as his assignment was 
only to look after administrative matters. He said the coach would 
be the chief selector while the captain and his deputy would be the 
fellow selectors.

Speaking from Mangla, the PCB chief said the selectors have not 
submitted the 14-man squad for Kenya. He, however, admitted that 
the selectors presented teams for the warm-up matches against 
England which were rejected.

"When the team for Kenya is to be discussed, the captain and the 
coach would be consulted. Their views would be duly taken into 
consideration but the selectors would be the final authority.

"However, the captain and the coach would not be considered when 
players for a training camp are being picked. That's precisely why 
the two were not invited for the meeting," the general said.

The PCB chairman said he rejected the warm-up teams submitted by 
the selectors on the ground that there were no youngsters. He said 
the selectors had included Test players who were either established 
or tested.

"I want youngsters in the team so that they get an opportunity to 
play and perform against a Test team. Besides, if the selectors 
pick a team which does not include players of the city where the 
match is being played, who would come to see the game?

"Secondly, for one of the matches, the selectors recommended Ijaz 
Ahmad as captain. It doesn't sound practical to me because we 
should groom some youngster as captain who can be considered for 
the job in future."

England will play two warmup one-dayers and then three first-class 
matches on their 57-day tour of Pakistan starting Oct 16.

The general, discussing his Dubai visit for the Asian Cricket 
Foundation (ACF) meeting, dispelled impressions that the continent 
was splitting and that Pakistan was being pushed into the corner by 
the other three members.

"It's not true. In fact, we are very much close. The only thing 
which could have split the world was inadequate development funds 
sanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Now that has 
also been averted because the ICC has promised to increase our 
funds by 50% and the money would be delivered within a week after 
the conclusion of the Kenya tournament.

"Also, Bangladesh has proposed a reciprocal two-Test and three one-
day international series in case India doesn't tour Pakistan this 
winter. The suggestion is under consideration."

Tauqir Zia said he met his Indian counterpart A.C Muttiah in which 
the possibility of the forthcoming series was discussed. He said 
the BCCI was very keen to tour but depended on the approval from 
his government.

He said the PCB has withdrawn its Sept 29 deadline for the 
confirmation of the tour because the two-day BCCI meeting will 
conclude on Sept 30. "But we have asked them to confirm the tour at 
the earliest."

<a name="begi">Pakistan begins its quest for hockey glory today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zawwar Hasan

SYDNEY, Sept 15: The moment of truth for Pakistan hockey has 
arrived. On Saturday it launches its campaign to regain lost glory 
at the Hockey Center in the Sydney Olympic Park with a match 
against Canada.

By all standards it is a forbidding task. Not just because the 
dizzying peaks it had reached in the past but also because the 
going has got tougher. At the top of the pyramid there is place for 
just one. And that one team has to be the best skilled and is tough 
in mind and body.

Do our men in green shirts answer the description? The optimists 
might say yes, the realists will say no. May be the correct answer 
is both yes and no. Yes, because Pakistan has snatched victory from 
the jaws of defeat so many times. No, because they could have been 
better prepared. Quick changes in hockey hierarchy and its empty 
coffers threaten to keep the PHF shelves bare of trophies.

But here at the Hockey Center the players are keeping their minds 
off the negatives. Their first aim is to reach the last four. And 
they think that despite disruptions and distractions, they have 
readied themselves to achieve their objective.

How ready they are and what challenges face them will be known for 
sure by ten pm tonight. Not only would have Pakistan played its 
opening match against Canada, but the remaining four other teams 
belonging to the same pool would be seen in action. That affords an 
opportunity to the think tank of the Pakistan hockey team to review 
its strategy for the remaining four pool matches.

Pakistan is taking its match against Canada very seriously. The Pan 
American Champions are known to be defence oriented and follow the 
1-3-3 combination.

They have sprung up many surprises and are a hard nut to crack. In 
their last encounter with Pakistan in the Commonwealth Games at 
Kuala Lumpur Canada had all but defeated Pakistan.

After having forged ahead by a comfortable 3-0 margin, the 
Canadians clung to 3-1 lead till five minutes before the final 
whistle. Two quick goals in the dying minutes of the game saved the 
day for Pakistan.

Basically the composition of the Canadian team remains the same. 
Seven of them have played more than hundred international matches, 
three of them topping two hundred. Their captain Peter Milkovich, a 
mid-field player, has the experience of 261 internationals.

Comparatively, Pakistan is a younger side even though six of its 
players have also crossed the hundred mark in international 
appearances. Most experienced among them is Mohammad Sarwar who has 
played 167 matches. His fellow forward, Kamran Ashraf, follows him 
with 130 matches. Ahmad Alam, who is the third goalkeeper to 
captain the Pakistan team, and mid-fielder Waseem Ahmad have played 
109 matches each. Sameer Hussain, who is an 18- year old student, 
is perhaps the babe of the Olympic hockey tournament. He has played 
only five matches so far.

To reach the last four Pakistan will have to defeat Canada, 
Malaysia, Great Britain and Germany or Holland. Pakistan will also 
have to win at least three of its matches with a good margin. That 
would enable them to go through to the quarterfinals even if there 
is a tie-up in three top positions of the pool.
