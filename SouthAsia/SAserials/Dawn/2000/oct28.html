<a name="mush">Musharraf rules out Kashmir's military solution</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Oct 27: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf on Friday 
said that Kashmir was the basic cause of tension between Pakistan 
and India, saying, military solution to the issue was not possible.

He was talking to the visiting foreign journalists from nine 
countries here on Friday.

Gen Musharraf said both the countries had fought three wars on the 
issue. It was in this perspective that Pakistan had been 
persistently urging India to agree to a negotiated settlement of 
the conflict in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri 
people, he added.

India had not responded positively so far, he regretted. This 
implied that India did not want political and peaceful settlement 
of the issue, Gen Musharraf added.

He also briefed the journalists about the massive human rights 
violations by Indian troops in occupied Kashmir. He maintained that 
while India was engaged in genocide in the occupied Kashmir, it 
pursued a strategy to get Pakistan declared a terrorist state.

The chief executive said although Islamabad was a nuclear power, it 
did not believe in aggression.

It wanted a peaceful settlement of Kashmir issue, through dialogue 
and in accordance with aspirations of the Kashmiri people but the 
Indian attitude was not positive, he said.-APP

<a name="40st">40 states to take part in defence exhibition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 24: International Defence Exhibition -IDEAS 2000 - to 
be held here from Nov 14 to 17 will be the first exhibition of its 
kind in Pakistan. About 40 countries would participate in the 
exhibition.

The IDEAS 2000 is likely to increase the export of Pakistan's 
defence equipment and would also help build a positive image of the 
country at the global level, said the Chief Coordinator of IDEAS 
2000, Maj-Gen S. Ali Hamid, and the chairman of Pegasus, the 
consultant firm.

They were briefing newsmen at the newly-built EPB Expo-Centre 
opposite the Civic Centre, the venue of the exhibition, on Monday.

The exhibition, where delegations of participating countries will 
be led by defence ministers and deputy defence ministers, chiefs of 
the army staff and other high military officials, would be opened 
by President Muhammad Rafique Tarar. The Chief Executive is likely 
to participate in the mega event of the exhibition on Nov 16.

Gen Ali Hamid said: "The IDEAS 2000 will be a biennial gathering of 
defence officials from friendly countries which would provide a 
good opportunity to promote professional interaction."

Answering questions, he said he had attended such shows recently in 
Dubai and France, and feels that the Dubai show was more like a 
mela but the atmosphere in France was businesslike. We are trying 
hard to create business-like conditions."

He said the idea was conceived about one and half years back with 
the theme "Arms for peace" which reflected Pakistan's desire to 
promote peace and stability both in the region and in the world.

<a name="plan">Plane case: Defence claims personal vendetta</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, Oct 26: Counsel for Nawaz Sharif in state's appeal for the 
enhancement of his sentence in the plane case on Thursday continued 
arguments mostly on law points and claimed that it was case of 
personal vendetta.

Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi, who was arguing before the full 
bench of the Sindh High Court, comprising Chief Justice Saiyed 
Saeed Ashhad, Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany and Justice Wahid Bux 
Brohi, also hinted that Azizullah Shaikh's admission of ordering 
diversion of plane was not with the consent of his client Nawaz 
Sharif in appeal against conviction.

At the very outset, Advocate General Sindh Raja Qureshi placed on 
court's record details of Mr Batalvi and Mr Azizullah Shaikh's 
meetings with their client Mian Nawaz Sharif in prison.

As Mr Batalvi dilated on various aspects of the case, and the 
sentence awarded to the former prime minister by the trial court, 
the bench observed that many of those points had already been 
discussed by Barrister Azizullah Shaikh.

In support of his contention on personal vendetta, Mr Batalvi 
referred to Gen Pervez Musharraf's recent interview to the BBC, in 
which he had reportedly said that if Nawaz Sharif had not removed 
him (the General), he would still have been the prime minister.

To reinforce his argument, he also drew the attention of the court 
to section 402B of the PPC, which was not in the scheduled offence 
on Oct 12.

He also claimed that the trial court had given wrong sentence to 
Nawaz Sharif under section 402.

Continuing arguments in support of his contention that Nawaz Sharif 
had not ordered the plane to be diverted, which was at complete 
variance with what Barrister Shaikh had argued in the former 
premier's appeal against conviction on the premise of consolidation 
of position in the power struggle, Barrister Batalvi argued that 
"admission by the counsel of the accused does not bind him as far 
as his defence is concerned. No admission by the counsel can 
relieve the prosecution of the duty of satisfying the court by 
proper evidence."

When he argued that Barrister Shaikh's admission in this regard 
could not be treated as that of Nawaz Sharif's, the chief justice 
inquired "irrespective of the admission with the consent of the 
accused? He had stated that he had made the statement after 
consulting his client."

But Mr Batalvi insisted "there is no evidence that Azizullah Shaikh 
made this statement with the consent of the accused".

When Mr Batalvi referred to Raja Qureshi's press conference in 
which he had contended that it could be part of boycott strategy by 
the defence counsel, the advocate general Sindh said that "if 
Batalvi saheb is not allowed to state what he want, he will 
boycott."

Barrister Batalvi also dealt with delay in the lodging of FIR and 
various provisions of the Suppression of Terrorism Act and Anti-
Terrorism Act 1997, in the context of the sentence awarded to the 
former premier by the trial court, and argued that Nawaz Sharif 
should not have been tried by the ATC.

Advocate General Sindh Raja Qureshi interceded and contended that 
all this had been argued before and cited 22-page order of Jan 12, 
2000, by Justice Shabbir Ahmed as administrative judge of the ATC, 
Karachi.

<a name="devo">Devolution plan to bring democracy: Gen Naqvi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: The devolution plan aims at laying the 
foundations of genuine democracy, giving political powers to the 
people and making government officials answerable to elected 
representatives.

This was stated by the Chairman of National Reconstruction Bureau 
Lt Gen Tanwir Hussain Naqvi while taking part in a television phone 
in programme on "Local government plan 2000", on Sunday.

He said development works will be decided by the locally elected 
people and implemented by government officials under the 
supervision of elected representative. He was confident that 
corruption would be eliminated, as development works will be 
carried out by the local leadership in the presence of the people. 
He said the devolution of power plan gives adequate representation 
to women, which has no precedence.

He said a new finance, auditing and contracting system is also 
being developed which will be in place before 14th of August next 
year before the installation of district governments to eradicate 
corruption.

In reply to a question he said the devolution plan will in fact 
give more provincial autonomy and reports to the contrary are 
baseless.

As for police reforms, he said the responsibilities of maintenance 
of law and order, traffic, investigation and prosecution are being 
separated. 

 He said provincial prosecution service will be created in police 
department in all the provinces. 

 He said the government realizes the problems being faced by the 
people at the police hands and to resolve local and minor disputes, 
community resolution systems are also being evolved.-NNI

<a name="gdad">GDA defers decision on alliance with PML</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Oct 25: The Grand Democratic Alliance on Wednesday deferred 
its decision on its future cooperation or alliance with the PML on 
the ground that so far it was not clear what exactly was in the 
mind of the former ruling party.

Heads of the alliance components were told that a three-member 
delegation of the former ruling party would meet Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan on October 29 to discuss the matter in black and 
white after which the GDA would be in a position to take any 
decision.

The Nawabzada, who was formally elected president of the GDA at a 
meeting of the heads of the alliance components, told reporters in 
the presence of other leaders that if necessary, he would convene 
an emergency meeting of the GDA to discuss the issue of cooperation 
with the PML. A final decision on the issue, he said, would be 
taken by the general council of the alliance.

Begum Kulsoom is scheduled to meet the Nawabzada on Thursday and 
matters concerning cooperation between the PML and the GDA will 
come up for discussion.

This will be the first formal meeting of the deposed prime 
minister's wife with the leader who 'midwifed' many opposition 
alliances in the past and is trying to play his role once again by 
bringing the two adversaries- PPP and the PML - on the same 
platform.

The Nawabzada brushed aside a number of questions about the 
possible new linkage between the GDA and the PML, saying every 
question would be hypothetical unless he heard something from the 
PML leadership. He did not answer a question as to what extent GDA 
was the ready to go with its former adversary.

When a reporter suggested that the alliance should have formulated 
its policy on this important issue as one of its leaders, Hamid 
Nasir Chattha, had already threatened to quit the GDA if the PML 
was let in, the Nawabzada said he would be able to say anything 
only after the situation was clear.

PML (Chattha group) Secretary-General Iqbal Ahmed Khan reiterated 
on Wednesday that his party would not sit with the PML as long as 
it was headed by Mian Nawaz Sharif.

LOCAL ELECTIONS: The alliance failed to decide its policy about the 
local elections, the first phase of which is due to be held in 18 
districts of the country on December 31.

The Nawabzada said the local councils were going to be partyless 
and thus political parties were left with no role to play. He 
pointed out that the GDA had already rejected the new system of 
local government as unworkable and violative of the provincial 
autonomy provided in the Constitution. The architects of the new 
system were alien to ground realities, he observed.

Asked whether the GDA would allow its supporters to contest these 
elections in their personal capacity, the senior leader wondered if 
there was any single individual in the country who had no direct or 
indirect affiliation with any party.

Observers say that the alliance is not going to give a boycott call 
and also would not stop anybody from taking part in these 
elections. All GDA parties are of the opinion that the field should 
not be left open to the government supporters.

<a name="pppr">PPP rejects NAB view on assets of Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

LAHORE, Oct 26: PPP Secretary-General Jehangir Badar on Thursday 
denied that any account, property or company abroad the National 
Accountability Bureau (NAB) has attributed to former prime minister 
Benazir Bhutto or her spouse Asif Zardari belong to the couple.

At a news conference at the office of Mr Naveed Chaudhry, he said 
such allegations had been concocted by former defunct ehtesab 
bureau chairman Saifur Rehman for the media trial of the Bhutto 
family and the same documents were now being used by the NAB 
prosecutor-general.

He said the party would have no objection if the government got all 
accounts, properties and assets confiscated.

"If these accounts don't belong to the Bhuttos, why had they 
approached the British government to have the details stopped when 
the Pakistan government had sought them?", a reporter asked.

Mr Badar said even if the allegation was accepted, the onus of 
providing proof lay with the government. He argued that the 
government was alleging that Mr Zardari had drug money which was 
factually wrong.

The PPP leader demanded that the media trial of the former prime 
minister should be stopped and the government should produce proof 
against Ms Bhutto or her husband, if it had any.

He answered in the negative when asked if he was holding the news 
conference in consultation with Ms Bhutto. He said the allegations 
were of repeated old story and he personally knew that the whole 
thing was baseless.

<a name="prov">Provinces asked to expedite land reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rauf Klasra

ISLAMABAD, Oct 25: The Centre has directed the provinces to 
accelerate the process of land reforms and redistribute land among 
the landless.

These directions, a source said, had been issued as a follow up of 
a report titled "Decentralization and Devolution of Power" that 
warned the government that unless the power base of "rural elites 
is diffused", the decentralization/local bodies elections would 
lead to their further strengthening.

The sources said that Sindh and Punjab provinces had been 
particularly asked to "quicken the process of redistribution of 
land" among the landless to empower them before the local 
government elections were held.

Besides, it would also enable them as well to stand on their own 
feet before the rural elites.

"This (redistribution of land) is being done to stop the rural 
elite from dictating their terms and condition to the weaker at the 
time of local bodies elections and getting their own candidates 
elected," an official of the local government ministry told Dawn on 
Tuesday.

The source said the report had warned the government functionaries 
that "if the decentralization is done without adequate checks and 
balances on the exercise of power and influence of the rural elite, 
it will create and strengthen local autocracy".

The report has questioned the oft-repeated argument that the 
fragmentation of landholding over the years had effectively 
diffused this source of power. It said that additional research and 
inquiry needed to be done to support this argument.

Even if landholding has reduced through fragmentation, the feudal 
mindset still reign supreme, it observed. "These power holders have 
traditionally controlled and even subverted electoral process at 
the national and provincial and local levels", the report said.

Citing examples, the report said that elections to local bodies in 
the past had yielded a leadership from the same pool of power 
holders and power brokers.

It said, while there was a diffusion of power among its various 
contenders - landholders, industrialists, civilian bureaucracy and 
local influential - the nexus between them make them a formidable 
power structure. "This structure staunchly resists all attempts to 
redistribute resources and equitably share power and authority."

The report further maintained that increasing deprivation and 
marginalization of the large non-elite population could lead to 
despair and helplessness on the one hand and frustration and 
resentment on the other. "Efforts are needed to break this pathetic 
situation", it suggested.

The report observed that while there were numerous challenges to 
decentralization, the biggest impediment was the entrenched power 
structure that was dominated by a small elite.

While the gap between the rich and the poor is often discussed in 
economic terms, it may also be viewed politically in terms of gap 
between the elite and non-elite at the time of formulation of 
policies, specially policies related to poverty, social exclusion 
and inequity.

<a name="sind">Sindh doctors to go to Saudi Arabia</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Oct 25: The Sindh government has reportedly decided to 
allow its doctors to go to Saudi Arabia to join their jobs there, 
however, the federal health ministry is still reluctant to show any 
leniency to its professionals already selected by Riyadh.

Sources in the federal government told Dawn that the Sindh 
government had indicated to the federal authorities on Wednesday 
that it would allow all of its 100 doctors to proceed to Saudi 
Arabia as per the agreement reached between Islamabad and Riyadh.

Chief Secretary Sindh, Javed Ashraf Hussain when contacted by Dawn 
said that the provincial government was reconsidering the case and 
hinted that the doctors would be issued the NOC in a couple of 
days.

Although the labour ministry, Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) 
and establishment division have succeeded in persuading the 
province to relieve its doctors, they failed to convince 
authorities in the federal health ministry to issue NOC to doctors 
stationed in Islamabad to join their jobs in Saudi Arabia.

An effort was made to persuade the health ministry even on 
Wednesday but without any positive outcome. The health ministry has 
reportedly reiterated its earlier stance and said that it could not 
relieve its doctors owing to the shortage of experienced hands in 
its hospitals.

Efforts are being made to arrange a meeting between labour minister 
Omar Asghar Khan and health minister Dr Abdul Malik Kasi to sort 
out the issue.

'<a name="usti">US tilt towards India may destabilize South Asia'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

DUBAI, Oct 27: The military regime in Pakistan is the best regime 
for India to hold talks on bilateral peace, according to a former 
Pakistani Chief of Army Staff.

"India must understand that the best time for talks with Pakistan 
is when there is a military government in the country because it 
will be fully responsible for its commitments and will not pass the 
buck to one or the other bureaucratic department in case of its 
failure to fulfil the promises," Gen Jehangir Karamat, a former 
Chief of Pakistan Army Staff, said in Dubai on Thursday.

He debated India's stand that it will only hold talks with a 
democratic government in Pakistan, meaning that a dialogue with a 
military government would be more result oriented.

Talking to members of the Pakistan Professionals Forum, diplomats 
and foreign guests on 'Peace in South Asia: Opportunities and 
Challenges', Gen Karamat said that the recent developments in 
Kargil could have led to direct war between India and Pakistan 
while the nuclear capabilities of the two countries added to the 
danger of war. "The political exploitation of the Kargil issue took 
us in the wrong direction instead of talks and a chance for peace 
was lost," he said.

He said that the end of cold war has reduced the great powers' 
interest in the South Asian region that has left the regional 
countries to decide on their own about what is of interest to them.

"Kashmir is the key issue in the region and even if the government 
in Pakistan changes, the country's policy on the subject will 
remain. The present standoff in Kashmir can severely worsen South 
Asian environment," he said adding that a military-civilian 
government was evolving in Pakistan. He denied extremism in 
Pakistan army but accepted that religious currents were stronger in 
the country than before.

<a name="govt">Govt urged not to weaken major political parties</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

 QUETTA, Oct 22: Leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) have 
called upon the government not to weaken the major political 
parties as it would harm the country's interest and endanger its 
integrity. 

 Addressing a seminar on "Benazir Bhutto, Balochistan and 
Pakistan," organised by the PPP Balochistan here on Sunday, PPP 
Vice-Chairman, Mr Yusuf Raza Gilani said that when there was a 
military government, Pakistan's integrity was challenged and 
threatened. 

 Giving his presidential remarks, he said that the political 
parties always worked for the strengthening of the unity and 
integrity of Pakistan and consolidated the federal set up. 

 The former speaker of National Assembly said that smaller 
political parties always joined the major parties in running the 
affairs of the country. 

 However, at present, the smaller parties are raising different 
voices undermining the integrity of Pakistan, the PPP leader said. 
The country was heading towards a two-party system, which would 
strengthen democracy and democratic values, Yusuf Raza Gilani said. 

 He was of the view that only major political parties could take 
the country out of the present economic and political crisis for 
which they have the capabilities and necessary strength. Mr Gilani 
resented the move to weaken the leadership of Benazir Bhutto and 
said that she was the symbol of federation. 

 On the issue of constitution, Mr Yusuf Raza Gilani said that it 
should be left to the chosen representatives of the people and an 
elected parliament. "If the constitution is tampered with, a 
Pandora's Box will be opened," he warned. He stressed the need for 
rule of law, strengthening the democratic institutions as weaker 
institutions would undermine country's integrity.

<a name="indi">India presses C'wealth to act against Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW DELHI, Oct 23: India on Monday said the Commonwealth needed to 
take a firmer stand in its efforts to restore democracy in Pakistan 
and Fiji.

A foreign ministry spokesman said an Indian delegation to the 
Commonwealth Ministerial Action group meeting, held in Samoa 
between Oct 18 and 20, had underlined the need for strong action.

He said the Indian team at the talks had said that Fiji's "1997 
constitution, which was drafted and chiselled under the 
Commonwealth, was best placed to guard the country's interests".

Spokesman Raminder Singh Jassal said the Commonwealth had already 
rejected Fiji's interim government's recommendation that the new 
constitution would be revised in a year and elections held in two 
years.

Fiji's government was overthrown by a coup led by local businessman 
George Speight, who seized Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his 
government, holding them as hostages for 58 days.

The deposed coalition government has been campaigning for an 
immediate recall of the elected parliament, which was cut short by 
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara within days of the hostage crisis 
and the setting up of a government of national unity.

Mara himself was deposed a week later by the army, which abrogated 
the 1997 multi-racial constitution and put in power an interim 
administration.

The administration has begun the process of a constitutional review 
by a committee, the membership of which has come under criticism by 
a large cross-section of society.-AFP

<a name="visa">Visa rules further relaxed: Negative list restricted to Indians</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Oct 26: In an effort to further soften the recently 
announced visa policy, the government has allowed the tourists from 
world over except those from India or foreign nationals of Indian 
origin to fly to Pakistan without getting prior clearance from 
country's missions abroad.

The government has also excluded Kenya from the negative list of 16 
countries after Kenyan government's move to relax its visa 
restrictions for Pakistani businessmen.

Interior Secretary, Hasan Raza Pasha told Dawn here on Thursday 
that for the purpose of tourist visa there would be no list of 
negative countries. 

 Mr Pasha explained that except Indian or foreign nationals of 
Indian origin, all tourists would be issued landing permits at 
country's airport or other entry points upon their arrival.

The condition of police registration has already been abolished for 
all foreigners except for Indian nationals and those who have 
Indian origin but got foreign nationalities. The latest move is 
expected to encourage the genuine tourists to visit Pakistan.

Earlier on Oct 13, the interior minister had announced in a news 
briefing that the tourists from countries on negative list would 
not be given the relaxation of entry permit. 

With the latest amendment in the visa policy, now all the tourists 
except Indian (living anywhere) will be issued 30 days landing 
permit at airports and other entry points, on arrival.

<a name="cabi">Cabinet wants Karachi problems solved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 25: The federal cabinet on Wednesday expressed its 
concern over the shortage of water supply and frequent power 
breakdowns in Karachi.

Chief Executive Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who chaired the meeting, 
directed the Sindh government and Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz to 
draw up a required plan for fast track processing through Executive 
Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), for the 
provision of extra water supply in the city.

Official sources said the CE told the meeting that whenever he 
visited Karachi, the complaints of acute shortage of water were 
made to him and that the issue must be sorted out as quick as 
possible. Furthermore, he also asked the officials of the Ministry 
of Water and Power about the reasons behind frequent and major 
power breakdowns in Karachi.

Sources said Musharraf advised the Ministry of Finance to look into 
the issue of additional funding and new arrangements should be made 
with the Sindh government to adequately address both the shortage 
of water and power breakdowns.

He further asked the Ministry of Petroleum to take steps for 
provision of gas to the Port Qasim Power Plant to facilitate its 
conversion from furnace oil to gas-fired.

Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Usman Amindduin 
informed the cabinet that gas would be available to the Port Qasim 
Plant by March 2001 from Zamzama Field. Steps were also in hand to 
convert other power plants in Karachi to gas-fired, he added.

The cabinet also directed all the four provincial governments to 
considerably cut down their expenditures with a view to make 
available additional funds for poverty alleviation.

Musharraf said the element of corruption should have to be 
eliminated to have better use of funds, especially for the 
alleviation of poverty and to arrange resources for other social 
sectors.

While the federal government has increased its share of funds for 
the poverty reduction programme during the current financial year, 
the provinces were asked to arrange prompt disbursement of their 
share of funds for all important programmes.

Taking note of complaints regarding supply of DAP, he directed the 
Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to 
take immediate measures, ensuring ready availability of the DAP for 
the current wheat sowing season.

On the issue, the finance minister informed the cabinet that the LC 
margin of 30 per cent on the DAP import had been withdrawn and no 
regulatory duty was being contemplated on it. The cabinet was 
informed that these incentives would encourage timely import of the 
DAP in the country.

The cabinet constituted a committee, headed by the minister for 
housing and works, to identify land, under the federal government, 
ministries and departments and suggested measures to dispose of 
such property. The provincial governments would undertake similar 
exercise to expedite disposal of such lands. Other members of the 
committee are Privatisation Commission chairman, cabinet secretary, 
finance secretary and the secretary Ministry of Housing and Works.

The committee would submit its report alongwith its proposal for 
disposal of property for approval. The Ministry of Railways would, 
however, undertake such exercise separately.

The cabinet approved promulgation of the Islamabad Rent Restriction 
Ordinance, 2000, which would bring the capital city at par with 
other areas of the country in terms of rent control.

The chief executive directed the Federal Land Commission to prepare 
a comprehensive policy for distribution of state land to landless 
peasants in the country. The commission would interact with the 
provincial governments to identify such lands and start the process 
of distribution.

The cabinet approved signing of an agreement between Pakistan and 
Kazakhstan on promotion and protection of investments. It also 
approved the Corporate and Industrial Restructuring Corporation 
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2000.

investigate into the alleged wrongdoings of many of its officials 
including ambassadors and other senior officers.

<a name="taxm">Taxman's powers to be slashed: CE discusses problems with traders</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 27: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf here on 
Friday assured the trade and business community that income tax on 
turnover profit for small traders would be removed, while the 
discretionary powers 
of the income tax officials under self-assessment scheme would be 
done away with.

The Chief Executive held out the assurance during a meeting with 
the members of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry and 
representatives of various NWFP trade groups.

The Chief Executive said that a comprehensive study for the 
restructuring of CBR was underway and would be completed in two 
months time. This was aimed at eliminating discretionary powers and 
corruption, making the CBR a tax-friendly and efficient 
organisation, the CE observed.

"We have had an extremely fruitful meeting with Gen Musharraf who 
has in principle accepted one of the major demands of removing 
income tax on turnover profit for small traders," claimed Haji 
Muhammad Haleem Jan, President Tajiran Rabta Committee, NWFP.

Haleem Jan, told Dawn that the Chief Executive had also assured 
that discretionary powers of income tax officials under self-
assessment scheme would also be done away with.

"Now a decision has been taken by the chief executive that there 
CE's Principal Secretary Tariq Aziz and Chairman Privatization 
Commission Altaf Saleem would hold a meeting with businessmen on 
Nov 2, to have a final decision on these two major issues which 
will largely benefit traders and businessmen of all the four 
provinces," he added.

He said the chief executive told the NWFP delegation that his 
government did not want to create problems for the business 
community and that those who would pressurise the taxpayers would 
be dealt with severely.

However, he said Gen Musharraf expected that everybody should pay 
his or her tax honestly so that the country could progress.

 Gen Pervez Musharraf said that all the genuine grievances of the 
businessmen would be addressed and resolved on priority basis.

He told the delegation that he would meet the cross-section of the 
business community within the next ten days to resolve some minor 
outstanding issues. The CE assured the traders that the irritants 
being faced by them would be removed.

Gen Musharraf regretted that mistrust existed between the tax 
collection agencies and taxpayers, which he said required 
resolution.

He asked the business community to work hand in hand with the 
government for the introduction of tax culture in the country.

The Chief Executive pointed out that the last date for filing 
income tax returns for the year 1999-2000 would not be extended 
beyond October 31.

He said that ongoing tax survey and documentation were vital for 
revival of the economy and were proceeding according to schedule.

The traders assured the chief executive that they would ensure that 
maximum number of returns were filed by the Oct 31 deadline.

During the meeting, which was held in a free, frank and cordial 
atmosphere, the traders and businessmen thanked the chief executive 
for giving them an opportunity to present their point of view with 
regard to income tax, sales tax, survey and documentation of the 
economy.

They supported the government's accountability drive and its 
efforts to revive the economy.

Governor NWFP Lt-Gen (retd) Iftikhar Hussain Shah, Chairman 
Privatisation Commission Altaf Saleem, Chairman CBR and other 
senior representatives of the ministry of finance also attended the 
meeting.

The traders delegation included the president of Sarhad Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, Syed Khizar Hayat, and other heads of a 
number of trade bodies of the province.

accrued from the documentation of the economy will be spent on the 
promotion of education, law and order and restructuring of 
government machinery, adds APP.

He said this while inaugurating COMSATS Institute of Information 
Technology (CIIT) at Sir Syed Campus.

Pakistan can make strides by utilising its physical resources and 
trained manpower, he said, adding, "scientific education can bring 
"development."

The chief executive said that the encouraging sign is that the 
international IT and soft-ware market is an ever-expanding 
proposition and those having capabilities can grab the 
opportunities. The IT market, he said, "is not shrinking, it has 
not saturated. It will continue to expand."

<a name="nofu">No further reduction: Import tariff at 25% by 2003</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: Pakistan has agreed with IMF to reduce its 
import tariff to 25 per cent from January I, 2003, said the 
Minister for Commerce, Industries and Production, Razak Dawood. 
"The reduction from 30 per cent, on January 1, 2002 to 25 per cent 
by January I, 2003 is part of our negotiations with the IMF", 
disclosed the commerce minister.

Speaking at a news conference here on Tuesday, he said that there 
would not be any further reduction in the import tariff. He said 
reduction of tariff to 25 per cent was unavoidable for Pakistan. 
"Certainly there will be a negative revenue impact due to this 
eventual 25 per cent import tariff", he conceded.

The commerce minister also said that the government was considering 
to offer export subsidy to wheat exporters. We have reached to a 
decision that wheat should be exported by the private sector for 
which we are considering to offer certain subsidy, he said adding 
that the purpose was to export surplus wheat and earn foreign 
exchange.

He also said that efforts were being made to export surplus rice to 
various countries. He said a number of delegations were being sent 
aboard including Iran for boosting export of Pakistani rice.

Razak Dawood said those who brought financial loss and bad name to 
the country by exporting inferior quality rice to various countries 
including Iran were being taken to task. In this regard he said 
that an export licence of M/s Consumer Power Limited has been 
cancelled for exporting substandard rice to Iran.

Nevertheless, he said Iran has again started importing rice from 
Pakistan and that a first ship carrying 50,000 tons of rice has 
reached Iran. We have been told that rice quality was of good and 
original specification.

Responding to a question the commerce minister said Thailand and 
Vietnam have offered to Iran for export of their rice and in return 
they will be importing oil from Teheran. "We have proposed counter 
trade to Iranians by exporting our rice to them and in return we 
will import their oil", he said adding Pakistan cannot afford to 
export rice on credit.

To another question he said that those who were involved in 
corruption and misuse of funds worth Rs7 billion in the Pakistan 
Steel were being taken to task. He agreed with a report that there 
was a need to implement the report of the Audit General of Pakistan 
who had pinpointed the corruption of Rs7 billion in PS. "Let me 
tell you that FIA is investigating the issue and it is not correct 
that the matter is being hushed up".

Asked whether it was not difficult to achieve $10 billion export 
target for 2000-2001, Razak Dawood said that export figures of the 
first quarter of the current financial year were promising.

He said Pakistan exported $2.2 billion worth of goods against the 
target of $2.3 billion in first quarter. There was a deficit of 
$100 million which he added was likely to be filled up during the 
month of October. He said a target of $802 million has been set for 
October and, "hopefully we will achieve it".

To a question he said there was a $638 million rice export target 
for the whole of 2000-2001 which showed an increase of 66 per cent 
in terms of quality and 17.5 per cent in terms of value compared to 
last year.

Talking about his recent visit to Indonesia and Malaysia, the 
commerce minister said he was there to increase Pakistan's trade 
relations with them.

<a name="petr">Petroleum sector lures $704m in one year</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: Federal Petroleum Minister Usman Aminuddin on 
Tuesday said that petroleum sector had attracted $704 million in 
the last one year.

Speaking at an investor's conference on "Reopening of Pakistan for 
Business", the minister said $571 million had been invested in 
upstream and $133 million in the downstream sectors.

Mr Aminuddin said major new investments in the upstream oil and gas 
sector were $268 million in the development of Bhit gas field by 
LASMO and its joint venture partners, Premier-Shell.

OMV of Austria will invest $212 million in the development of Miano 
and Sawan gas fields and BHP Petroleum to invest $18 million in the 
development of Zamzama gas field. In addition, Petronas of 
Malaysia, Paige (USA), TotalFina (France) and OMV are committed to 
spending $66.8 million in exploration, both onshore and offshore, 
he added.

He said the petroleum sector was going through an extensive 
restructuring, reforming and traditionally involved in managing the 
market and allocating these resources.

The public sector oil and gas companies were given autonomy to 
operate on commercial lines without the government interference. 
These steps were not only bringing high yields but also helping the 
sector to develop on the fast track.

The minister said that major steps were being taken to develop the 
oil and gas sector. The process of exploration and development of 
oil and gas fields was being accelerated and increased foreign 
investment was being encouraged, he said.

Dilating on the salient features of oil and gas sector reforms, he 
said the development of the recently discovered huge resources of 
gas was being expedited. Independent regulatory authorities were 
being established for operators and development of the sector, he 
added.

Mr Aminuddin said the government would encourage the conversion of 
power plants from furnace oil to gas, which would reduce the heavy 
oil import bill to a great extent.

He said the petroleum sector was being deregulated and the 
privatization process was being expedited to bring in greater 
efficiency and new investment adding that LPG has already been 
deregulated and the use of CNG was being promoted.

<a name="chie">Chief Executive says Hubco dispute near settlement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: The government of Pakistan and the Hub Power 
Company (Hubco) were close to settling a three-year-old power 
tariff dispute, Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf told 
foreign investors here on Tuesday.

He held out an assurance to investors at a two-day conference 
organised by Chase JF (Jardine-Fleming Pakistan Pvt), that there 
would be complete protection of their investments in Pakistan.

A number of investors had raised the issue of Hubco and said that 
the government needed to settle this matter first, if it wanted to 
attract other foreign investors to Pakistan.

The Chief Executive said his government was offering all possible 
fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors, besides ensuring law 
and order in the country, and Pakistan was ideal for investment.

The CE told participants that most of the differences with Hubco 
had been settled, and that both sides were about to conclude a new 
agreement on tariff and other administrative issues. He described 
the Hubco issue an "irritant" and assured investors it would be 
resolved very soon.

General Musharraf however added that both sides should show 
reciprocity, to end the dispute. He said his government was the 
first one which took up the issue seriously, to try to resolve it 
permanently. He also referred to his meeting with Hubco Chairman 
Muhammad Ali Sheikh Ali Reza in New York, on the 10th of August, 
and said both sides were negotiating with all sincerity to resolve 
the dispute.

When asked about this meeting, the Chief Executive of Hubco, S. 
Kurshid Hussain, who was also attending the conference said that he 
appreciated the personal efforts being made by General Musharraf to 
settle the issue. He confirmed that he was asked by the finance 
minister to call the Hubco chairman and other directors to 
Pakistan, to conclude an agreement between the two sides.

Mr Kurshid however added that the kind of flexibility the 
government was talking about needed to be translated into action. 
He said the Hubco chairman had written a letter to the finance 
minister on October 6, to confirm the acceptability of the new 
tariff so that he could travel to Pakistan to sign the new 
agreement, but to date there has been no reply.

<a name="econ">Economic revival plan: Sindh govt holding session today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Oct 26: Industrial production and employment in Sindh 
continue to decline alarmingly, and according to official survey 
industrial production dropped by 5.64 per cent, wherein 
unemployment surged by 4.30 per cent.

In the survey of 29 major categories of industries - spread over 
more than 450 industrial units - officials involved did not find 
any let-up in the trend during the last four months. There are, 
however, some expectations that the textile sector - which includes 
more than 80 factories in the province - may pick up production and 
generate employment from this month.

Over 3,000 employees lost jobs in Pakistan Steel during this one 
year which has offset an increased employment generation in textile 
sector.

In the backdrop of this dismal scenario, Sindh government is 
holding a day-long session on Friday. Reports by the eight sub-
committees formed about two months ago, suggesting package of 
recommendations for the revival of Sindh economy will be presented.

These committees are off-shoots of a Task Force, headed by the 
Sindh finance minister, and constituted by Sindh Governor for 
helping in formulation of two to three-year economic revival plans.

Comprising business leaders, academicians, agriculturists and 
bureaucrats these sub-committees were asked to prepare reports on 
(1) Unemployment, (2) Industry, (3) Resource generation, (4) New 
areas, (5) Urban affairs, (6) Agriculture, livestock, fisheries and 
water management, (7) Project implementation and (8) Rural 
Development.

Along with these, another committee comprising a dozen ministers 
and bureaucrats has also been formed to engage businessmen, 
agriculturists, professionals and economists in consultation for 
the preparation of a strategy to be adopted in the next 
deliberations of National Finance Commission.

<a name="bank">Banks cut L/C margin to 25pc </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Oct 23: Banks on Monday reduced the cash margin from 30 to 
25 on all imports and lifted the margin on imports of DAP 
fertilizer and edible oil.

An announcement by all banks said, banks will implement this 
decision from Tuesday (October 24). It said imports of crude oil 
and POL products will continue to remain exempted from the cash 
margin. The announcement said the margin already charged will not 
be refunded. Senior bankers said the decisions were taken at a 
meeting held here at the National Bank head office. Heads of 
majority of local as well as foreign banks attended the meeting.

The announcement said the decision to cut LC margin by five per 
cent and exempt two more essential items from it was taken after 
banks felt that the margin had brought about the desired result in 
exchange rates.

Banks had imposed 30 per cent cash margin on import letters of 
credit on October 5 after the rupee had fallen to 59.75/59.80 to a 
dollar in the inter-bank market and was heading toward a free fall. 
The purpose was to mop up excess liquidity from the market and make 
panic buying of greenbacks more expensive for importers.

The ploy worked. Import-led panic buying slowed. And the rupee made 
a dramatic recovery of 6.5 per cent in the inter-bank market within 
two weeks-rising to 55.95/56.15 on October 20. Bankers watched the 
upward march of the rupee but kept the cash margin unchanged. They 
believed that the rise of the rupee was temporary nature and it 
could start falling again once its complacency was over.

Their apprehension was not unfounded because the rupee fell to 
56.60/56.70 on increased demand for the dollars from importers.

In past two weeks pressure kept building up on banks to lift the 
margin. Business organizations including the All-Pakistan Textile 
Mills Association said the margin had added to their financial woes 
and called for its withdrawal. On the other hand the government 
also felt that if the banks could not lift the margin they should 
exempt from it a couple of essential imports.

It is against this backdrop that the banks on Monday exempted 
edible oil and DAP fertilizer from the cash margin requirement.

Top bankers told Dawn that they would continue to review the LC 
margin in future. They said if the exchange rate showed some more 
stability progressive cuts in the margin will continue.

Businessmen say - and bankers do not argue against this - that the 
margin needs to be phased out during this quarter as it was time 
for the private sector credit to pick up. Private sector normally 
starts making fresh borrowings from the banking system in October 
every year. This continues through next six months and comes to a 
near halt in March. Between April and September private sector 
normally retires bank credit instead of borrowing afresh.

What keeps this borrowing cycle in motion is the fact that in 
Pakistan agricultural productivity is at its peak between October 
and March. That generates demand for working capital both by the 
industrialists as well as the traders.

has been launched, which will minimize contact between the taxpayer 
and the customs staff.

CBR has finalized the procedure for availing the facility, and it 
will not be available to imports and parties put on the exclusion 
list. The Electronic Assessment System (EASY), designed by Pakistan 
Revenue Automation Ltd, will help in computerized valuation and 
duty assessment.

A source told Dawn that about 40 per cent of valuation and 
assessment work will be computerized by end the of the November.

The initial beneficiaries of the system will be the importers 
including multinational companies who already enjoy the "Express 
Lane Facility" at the examination consignment stages. Lists of such 
companies have already been circulated among the relevant staff.

All imports made by public sector (federal, provincial governments, 
state-owned corporations, local bodies) will also be the initial 
beneficiaries at statutory rates of customs duty and sales tax.

Apart from these, all items chargeable to specific rates of customs 
duty (excluding composite rate, and selected items chargeable to 
zero rate of duty, sales tax will also be the first among 
beneficiaries.

The facility of EASY shall not be available in cases where bill of 
entry is filed prior to arrival of vessel; old, used, second hand, 
reconditioned and scrap items. Items, import of which is either 
banned or restricted, by the Import Policy Order are also not to

through any notification; where payable duties and taxes etc are 
not declared along with other required information; importers whose 
names are blocked due to default/any other reason; and the clearing 
agents who have either expired or have been blocked.

Bills of entry will be computerized. The eligible importers or 
their clearing agents will prepare the bill of entry as per normal 
procedure and shall declare on the bill of entry that clearance 
under EASY by affixing a stamp on the face of each page of bill of 
entry.

KARACHI, Oct 27: Habib Bank Ltd is set to reach out to medium- size 
businessmen initially across five cities to snatch back its lost 
share of trade financing business from small private banks.

The cities are: (i) Karachi (ii) Faisalabad (iii) Sialkot (iv)

Mahmood told Dawn. Karachi will have the largest number of 
commercial centres i.e. 10 followed by Lahore 5 and Sialkot 4. 
Faisalabad and Rawalpindi will have 2 each.

Mahmood said Sialkot and Faisalabad offered huge opportunities in 
trade financing to medium size exporters of yarn and sports and 
surgical goods. Similarly thousands of medium size importers in 
Jodia Bazar; Cloth Market; Timber Market and other commercial hubs 
of Karachi need an easy-to-access trade financing facility.

Mahmood would not define medium size businessman-maybe for reasons 
of business secrecy-but HBL sources said the term covers trading 
houses with an annual turnover of more than five but less than 
forty million rupees.

That makes sense. Because HBL regards businesses with turnover up 
to Rs 5 million as retail customers. And it treats businesses 
having turnover of Rs 40 million or more as corporate clients. HBL 
sources say medium size customers will be taken care of by a 
separate commercial banking division within its retail banking 
group.

"Historically HBL has been a trade financing bank. We must try to 
restore this image," Mahmood said admitting that the bank had lost 
part of its trade financing business to small private banks.

<a name="manp">Manpower policy to generate 2.96m jobs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Oct 22: A three-year new manpower policy has been 
prepared to generate 2.96 million new jobs internally with a GDP 
growth rate of 5.5 per cent over the next three years (2000-2003).

Major thrust of the new manpower policy is on the development of a 
well-trained, skilled labor force.

Labor ministry officials told Dawn that a new "employment/ manpower 
and income policy" has been prepared after reports that 
unemployment backlog in the year 2000 has reached 1.95 million and 
by the year 2003, 4.5 million people will be seeking jobs.

The policy pointed out that the return of Pakistani workers from 
abroad after 1988 has played an important part in accentuating the 
pressure on domestic employment situation.

The policy said in addition to local job opportunities, net 
overseas migration in the order of 0.3 million is alsoexpected, 
thus leaving the numbers of unemployed towards the end of the 
three-year programme to 1.24 million or about 3 per cent compared 
with the unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent.

It said the decline in the participation rates particularly in the 
age group of 10-19 might be attributed to increasing attendance in 
schools and colleges. Besides, increase was also observed in the 
self-employment opportunities.

Increasing migration in mid 1970s and mid 1980s has also 
constrained the growth of domestic labour force.

According to the report of the National Manpower Commission, almost 
25 per cent of the incremental labour force during 1978-83 found 
employment abroad. But, their return to the country in the late 80s 
increased pressure on local employment market, the policy pointed 
out.

The main objectives of the sector during the three-year period are 
to establish the right macro-economic climate to set up an economic 
framework, which supports business by deregulation and reducing 
red-tapism undermining competitiveness.

National competitiveness will be achieved by a common vision and an 
integrated approach to help build energetic, dynamic local 
economies focussing on local economic development and regeneration 
in both urban and rural areas will be adopted.

The government will develop and encourage a "world class work 
force" with the skills needed for successful business.

The policy envisages setting up of an autonomous body in the shape 
of National Training Council, which would be responsible for 
formulating the national training policy and its implementation.

The policy also places heavy reliance on the private sector for 
formal jobs. Appropriate incentives will be offered to the sector, 
curricula will be developed along with testing and certification 
mechanisms. The incentives may include soft loans, matching grants 
and duty-free import of training equipment.

<a name="rupe">Rupee begins to fall</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 23: The rupee ended at 56.60/56.70 to a dollar in the 
inter-bank market on Monday-down by 60 paisa from the previous 
close of 56.00/56.10.

Bankers said the rupee had to shed some of its charm as import -led 
demand for dollars rose forcing a couple of banks to go for buying 
greenbacks from other banks to cover their daily requirement.

This reversed a two-week long trend marked by a steady upward march 
of the rupee. The rupee recovered 6.5 per cent in two weeks to 
October 20-rising from 55.95/56.15 to 58.75/58.80 on October 5 
showing a huge recovery of 6.5 per cent.

A number of factors had helped the rupee make this recovery: (i) 
one per cent increase in repo rate (ii) two per cent hiking of 
treasury bills rates (iii) two per cent increase in the cash 
reserves requirement of banks and (iv) a 30 per cent cash margin on 
imports.

These measures put together squeezed out excess liquidity from the 
market thus reducing panic buying of dollars by importers. At the 
same time this tightening of monetary measures also raised the 
supply of export dollars. What else helped the rupee recover 
dramatically in the inter-bank market was that the importers who 
had made panic forward buyings had to sell back the dollars after 
their trade contracts failed to materialise.

And last but not the least the State Bank slowed the process of 
clearing the applications for outward remittance of foreign 
exchange by portfolio investors for some days.

Bankers say after the rupee hit 56 to a dollar in the inter- bank 
market most exporters slowed selling of export dollars as they knew 
that the rupee would fall again. On the other hand the importers 
again rushed to buy greenbacks for the same reason.

<a name="funa">Fun and games </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

WE have much too much gloom and doom surrounding us - it is high 
time we had some fun and games.

"My centre is giving way, my right is in retreat; situation 
excellent. I shall attack." During the closing months of World War 
I, so said Ferdinand Foch (1851-1929) Marshal of France, of Great 
Britain and of Poland, and Commander of the Allied Forces. Foch is 
generally accounted as the leader most responsible for the Allied 
victory. King Albert I of Belgium said of him: "That man could make 
the dead fight."

That was over eighty years ago. Time moves on, but this country has 
failed to move on with it. We are not at war. Our centre is not 
giving way. Our right is not in retreat. However, the situation may 
not be excellent. On October 19 2000, front-page headlines informed 
us: "Anti-Pakistan utterances - leaders to be dealt with strictly: 
Govt." (Dawn); "Anti-Pak rhetoric not to be tolerated" (The 
Nation); "Cabinet warns of stern action against anti-Pak 
statements. Seeks report on statements of Altaf, Muttahida 
delegation, Magsi, Mumtaz Bhutto" (The News).
 
"General Haider Sahib, people are talking against the national 
security, the army, the two-nation theory and geographical 
boundaries ..... why don"t you take action against them?" This is 
what Dawn reported General Pervez Musharraf as having said in the 
cabinet meeting of October 18. And, "You better know what is the 
punishment for talking against the Constitution," an interior 
ministry official is quoted as having told Dawn after the cabinet 
meeting. "The Cabinet decided that anit-state activities would not 
be allowed and anybody making statements against Pakistan would be 
dealt with severely," is quoted in The Nation as being an official 
statement made after the meeting.

The News reports: "Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf chaired 
the meeting which was also attended by all the provincial 
governors. Though it was not an agenda item, the Chief Executive 
took the initiative of pointing out anti-Pakistan statements by 
certain political leaders and regretted the irresponsible attitude 
of these leaders. 'They can criticise my person, policies of the 
government, but they should not be allowed to talk against 
Pakistan,' Musharraf told the cabinet as quoted by the source."

May we remind the general that he has deprived the corrupt 
politicians of their very livelihood, of their bread and butter, 
not just their jam. So should they not cry, should they not 
protest? And should they not be allowed to say what they will? And 
should whatever they say not be treated with utter disdain? This 
takes me back to my school, BVS, to Gujerati Class III to my class 
master, Ranchordass Nagardass who wielding the school cane with gay 
abandon used to say "I will beat you, it will hurt, but you cannot 
cry."

Can we not assure the general that the statements of these 
disgraced men, if so made and correctly reported, do far less harm 
to the people and our country than signs put outside the parks by 
his officers in uniform, in military cantonments and housing 
societies informing those who wish to use the park, that the 
wearing of shorts is banned. The signs are directed at men and 
young boys. Just what is the message conveyed? It does not take too 
long to work it out in these fundamentalist-closed mind-orientated 
days.

The name of the game is cricket, on which subject I wrote last 
week. In response, I received one message from an irate 
octogenarian aunt asking me what is so great about Pakistan having 
a woman's cricket team. We Parsis, she told me, had one in the 
early 1900s. Why don't you write on Zoroastrian achievements in the 
sporting world? she asked. My telling her that that we BC wallas 
have enjoyed their empires and their glory, now let's encourage the 
new-comers, the AD wallas, did not appease her. She referred me to 
the book Parsis and Sports written by Hormuzdiyar Dhunjishaw 
Darukhanawala. As his name suggests he comes from a family of wine 
merchants.

This quaint book was written in Bombay in 1935, sponsored by 
advertisements inserted by Parsi firms and individuals. One 
advertiser is Darukhanawala himself, a roller-skater, the 
proprietor and instructor of the Bombay Skating Class at Gowalia 
Tank. The advertisement tells readers: "This class has had the 
honour of receiving tuitions in the art of roller skating from the 
ex-world champion skater Mr A. S. Tony of Vienna, trick and fancy 
roller-skater and speciality dancer," Duke & Sons of Grant Road, 
Bombay, specialists in bottling and selling non-alcoholic drinks, 
advertised their speciality, Prune Ade, 'the most palatable of all 
sweet drinks, made of Bordeaux prunes'."

Tharsa Manufacturing Company owned by Taimuljee Wadia, a 
pharmacist, was famous for the dispensing of Wadia's own special 
mixture "Tharsa (for external use only)" which was advertised as "A 
tried and proven remedy for paralysis, pneumonia, cramps, 
palpitation of the heart, heart disease, lumbago, pain in joints 
and bones, asthma, swelling in the throat, pain in the abdomen, 
swelling in joints, and rheumatic pains of all kind. Wounds caused 
by sharp iron can be successfully cured by Tharsa. Sold 
Everywhere."

In the chapter on cricket in Bombay, the book quotes from a speech 
given by Sir Pherozeshah Mehta in April 1886 at a dinner given in 
honour of the Parsi team that was leaving for England to play 
against the English team:

"I, gentlemen, remember the time about a quarter of a century ago 
when our co-religionists first took to cricketing. Those days are 
quite fresh in my mind from the fact of my being one of the very 
first who was engaged in this game. This fact was unknown to fame, 
and I am particularly glad to make a public announcement this 
evening that it was on the maidan outside the ramparts that the 
pioneers of cricket, proud of their bats and stumps, which were 
made by a native carpenter, had begun to play. Since then the game 
has flourished among us ...... The days of my exploits on the 
cricket field have long since passed away, but to this day there is 
no more agreeable sight to me in Bombay, while passing down 
Esplanade Road, than that of the whole maidan overspread by a lot 
of enthusiastic Parsi and Hindu cricketers, keenly and eagerly 
engaged in this many game.

"I may say that the object of the team in going to England is a 
very modest one. Cricket as you know is the national game of 
England. It has taken root among the Parsi community, and as 
artists go to Italy to do homage to the great Masters ....... so 
now the Parsis are going to England to do homage to the English 
cricketers, to learn something of that noble and manly pastime in 
the very country which is its chosen home."

The team played 28 matches in England, one resulting in victory, 19 
being lost and eight drawn.

Sir Dhanjibhoy Bomanji (still living when the book was written) is 
described as being in his younger days "a true physical culturist, 
having been a pupil of the late Eugene Sandow, 'The Strong Man of 
Europe' and the pioneer of physical culture, who a quarter of a 
century ago was called to Bombay by Sir Dhanjibhoy to give him 
special physical treatment." Apparently, within a few months "he 
acquired a marvellous physique and was considered to be one of the 
strongest men in his community."

Sir Dorab Tata (1859-1932) as recounts the book "won his colours at 
Caius for cricket, rugger and soccer and played tennis for the 
college. Coxed a college boat. Won several sprint events on the 
cinder path, including a 120 yards. Varsity handicap. Was a member 
of the varsity long vacation cricket eleven in 1878. Won his 
colours as a Crusader. Was a member of the MCC, the Surrey Club, 
the Ranelagh and Hurlingham Clubs, also Queen's Club. On return to 
India he captained the Parsi Cricket Club and took representative 
Parsi teams to play against the Poona Gymkhana. Later he helped 
start the Parsi Gymkhana of which he was the Hon Secretary for 
about ten years, and captained the cricket team during that period 
...... In him the Parsi community lost a great patron of sport and 
a great Industrialist."

Morals for the day: Despite our ever-increasing enemies of 
laughter, we must learn to laugh more. And despite our ever-greedy 
developers and builders, whatever maidans and open spaces we still 
have must be kept as maidans and open spaces for our deprived but 
enthusiastic young sportspeople.

<a name="thek">The killjoy spirit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

UNTIL Bhutto messed up things in 1977 - incidentally, doing a 
thorough job of the messing up - and gave an opening to the 
killjoys of the nation to seize the political high ground (an 
advantage these righteous armies have never vacated), Pakistan 
enjoyed just the right tension between the opposite pulls of sin 
and salvation.

In the most happily-constituted Muslim societies this tension 
always existed, indeed contributing in no small measure to the 
diversity and extent of their achievements. When Europe lay in the 
grip of mediaevalism and the torch of learning and knowledge was 
held aloft by Muslim scholars, this life-enhancing tension found 
full expression in the world of Islam.

The good Muslim scrupulously fulfilled his religious obligations. 
He kept himself clean - a stage of civilization which the peoples 
of Europe arrived at several centuries later. He offered his 
prayers, kept the fast, gave alms to the poor and, if the 
opportunity beckoned, made the pilgrimage to Makkah. Withal, a 
simple religion, its early appeal owing as much to the sharpness of 
the Islamic sword as to the startling simplicity of its canon. 
Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity - all so complicated by comparison. 
But let's not get into these invidious distinctions.

Fulfilling religious obligations, however, was only one aspect of 
the life of the good Muslim. He also had an eye for the finer 
things of life: verse, story-telling, abstract speculation. To 
commemorate his faith, he built handsome mosques; to celebrate life 
he laid gardens and erected fountains. And through it all, even 
though aware of the strictures of his faith, he was not above being 
touched by the madness which comes from paying homage to the deity 
of the vine. The Muslim of that period enriched human civilization. 
In part if not wholly, was it not because he himself lived life to 
the full?

The best Urdu poetry is also full of this creative tension as 
evidenced by the contrasting images of mosque and tavern (viz. 
Ghalib's famous verse, 'In the mosque's shadow let wine be brought' 
- this being a rough translation) and the clashing metaphors of 
shaikh (he who preaches) and saqi (he who pours the wine). Why is 
this tension creative? Because, as philosophers have preached from 
Heraclitus to Hegel, there would be no unity in the world if there 
were not opposites to combine: "It is the opposite which is good 
for us." (Heraclitus) In Urdu poetry, unless I am grossly mistaken, 
wine and the cup are symbols of rebellion, of going against the 
accepted norm. Where would be the charm of Ghalib's verse if this 
tension between the permitted and the forbidden was missing?

This is the problem with Pakistan today: not so much military rule, 
or the Grand Democratic Alliance or even the country's mounting 
debts as the killjoy place it has become - all sermons and 
preaching and no idea of fun, much less the idea of illicit fun 
which in any clime acts as a spur to the imagination. Discourse in 
all its forms in the Islamic Republic has become admonitory: do 
this, do that. Of course, there are other problems which assail our 
country but it does not help when to these problems is added the 
cross of a monumental boredom.

Other places endeavour to manufacture happiness, even if the 
happiness so produced is tinselly and short-lived. We have become 
adept at producing unhappiness: a state of mind which has nothing 
to do with material deprivation and everything with a disease of 
the spirit. Small wonder then if even well-heeled Pakistanis look 
the way they do: dissatisfied, depressed and perpetually insecure. 
Forget the poor; the Pakistani rich are more insecure, a fact 
attested to by the insatiable greed of the good and the great. (The 
corruption of the Sharifs and Zardaris has always stumped me for 
this reason. So much money, to what purpose?)  

Do Pakistanis deserve this? They are not a sickly people and given 
half the chance are able to enjoy life as much as anyone else. 
(Uncharitable souls, seeing Pakistanis in their cups or on the 
dance floor, might even say that their capacity for enjoyment is 
more than most.) Do Pakistanis deserve the constant onslaught of 
piety to which they have been subjected these past 25 years?

Every Islamic society in history, or indeed any other society for 
that matter, has its killjoy puritans, who believe that the 
conscious pursuit of misery is an essential pre-requisite for 
attaining life everlasting. In a healthy society such elements are 
ignored or kept safely to the sidelines. Not in Pakistan where 
their nuisance value has found recognition in a spurious morality.

Apart from external security which we need not go into here, what 
are the foremost functions of the state? Maintaining law and order, 
collecting revenue, delivering essential services, providing equal 
opportunities, etc. These temporal functions the state is less and 
less able to discharge with any semblance of efficiency. So what 
does it do? It assumes a spiritual role for itself and becomes the 
arbiter of the nation's morals. Not, let it be noted, the nation's 
public morals which have become corrupted beyond redemption but 
only the private morals of its citizens.Nor is this all. As if the 
people of Pakistan need constant reminders of the gratuitous misery 
to which they are exposed, consider the person chosen by the Fates 
as the Chief Magistrate of the Republic. Not that he is unworthy of 
his high office. Only this that the piety he exudes is of the kind 
with which the people of Pakistan have been assaulted since Zia-ul-
Haq's time. So is it any surprising if the sum of national 
depression should register an increase every time he appears on 
television?

As I have said above, there are other great problems awaiting the 
nation's attention: amending the Constitution, giving the army a 
permanent role in politics (as if the army needs any permission in 
this regard), grooming a new leadership (grim prospect this), 
reviving the economy, filling our begging bowl, and so on. But 
before tackling this thick agenda, the people of Pakistan might be 
given a break. They are not likely to see inflation come down any 
time soon or the job situation improve in a hurry. But at least 
they could be spared the sermons and speeches. And the dry climate 
which is responsible for so much of the moaning and whining to be 
heard in the country.

So what is the conclusion? Probably only this that the excessive 
salvation which has held the field since 1977 when Bhutto, boxed 
into a corner, messed up everything needs to be balanced now with a 
bit of loosening up. Pakistanis have been uptight for too long. 
They need to cheer up a bit and cultivate (although this is not 
easy) a bit of happiness. I suspect that a good deal of the gloom 
and doom to be heard in the country has to do with the monotony of 
life in Pakistan. Pakistanis get a kick out of being depressed. But 
are they to blame when they can get a kick out of nothing else? Let 
us also remember that whether in Pakistan or elsewhere it is not 
sinners who bemoan the state of the world. Sinners generally are 
more relaxed about these things. It is evangelists and reformers 
who think that the world is coming to an end.

The late Jam Sadiq Ali had it about it right. Long after his 
political sins are forgotten, the social reforms he undertook in 
Sindh will be remembered. How did he succeed where others have not 
even tried? For the sake of the nation's well-being, his methods 
deserve a close examination.

<a name="theh">The high cost of jihad </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

I HAVE before me a pamphlet issued by a leading jihadi 
organization; on the last page is an appeal for donations to 
finance the struggle in Kashmir. The price of a Kalashnikov is 
given as Rs 20,000; a bullet is Rs 35; and a "Kenwood wireless" is 
listed at Rs 28,000. The total "launching fee" for a mujahid, 
inclusive of training, arms and transportation is a cool Rs 
140,000.

On the other end of the scale is the much larger but un-
quantifiable figure of what we as a nation are being penalized for 
our support of such activities. Across the world, we have been 
branded an exporter of fundamentalism and terrorism. Pakistanis are 
known to have taken part in large numbers on the side of the 
Taliban in battles in Afghanistan. The Russian government has 
accused us of sending fighters to Chechnya and there are reports of 
Pakistanis fighting as far away as in Bosnia. At the very least, 
this and previous governments have turned a blind eye to these 
private initiatives.

Recently, Shah Ahmad Noorani of the Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Pakistan has 
praised General Pervez Musharraf for drawing a clear distinction 
between terrorism and jihad. The problem is that the rest of the 
world is not buying such sophistry. While it is a truism to say 
that one man's jihad is another's terrorism, we need to distinguish 
between random violence against innocent civilians aimed solely at 
creating terror, and battling armed and trained forces for a just 
cause. Far too often, this line is crossed and the negative 
publicity generated by the killing of unarmed bystanders outweighs 
any possible advantage gained through terrorizing the civilian 
population.

This has happened far too often in Kashmir where foreign tourists 
and non-Muslims have been deliberately targeted by various jihadi 
groups. In much of the world, these actions are seen as terrorism 
pure and simple. While the perpetrators of such crimes lose any 
sympathy and support. Pakistan is seen as supporting the militants 
who committed these acts, and is therefore considered an exporter 
of terrorism. As a result, our ties with traditionally friendly 
countries in the Arab world as well as with Iran and China have 
suffered.

Of late, there has been much talk of boosting tourism. But people 
from General Musharraf to the officials of the Pakistan Tourism 
Development Corporation overlook the fact that the rhetoric 
emanating from our proliferating jihadi outfits does not exactly 
encourage foreigners to visit a country where talk of enforcing an 
alien way of life by force is rife. Many tourist destinations in 
our picturesque northern areas have become centres of religious 
fundamentalism: witness this government's surrender to demands that 
cable TV should be banned in Peshawar.

Investors, too, are wary of putting in any funds in a country which 
is seen abroad as intolerant, aggressive and retrogressive. There 
was a letter to the editor of this newspaper recently complaining 
that a local restaurant refused to serve a foreigner who was 
wearing shorts. Similarly attired men are barred from entering 
public parks. All these absurdly obscurantist steps are signs of 
the creeping Talibanization that has been going on for some time 
now. As a society, we are paying an intolerable price for our 
mindless support of the most reactionary elements in the country.

Indeed, perhaps the highest price of bigotry is the divisive effect 
it has had on society. Already, Ahmadis, Christians and Hindus have 
been declared beyond the pale. Many Sunni groups (most notably the 
Sipah-i-Sahaba) have been demanding that Shias be declared non-
Muslims. Various sects are at each other's throats. Armed attacks, 
often in mosques, on Shias are common. Iranian citizens have been 
deliberately targeted. No nation can sustain this level of violence 
and religious intolerance indefinitely, and given the number and 
sophistication of arms possessed (and often openly displayed) by 
jihadi groups, it does not appear likely that the killing will stop 
any time soon.

We had all hoped that the army, being the only national institution 
with the power to take on the jihadi elements, would tackle them 
when it took over last year. But by making a distinction between 
jihad and terrorism, General Musharraf has given these elements the 
green light. Both in Kashmir and Afghanistan (and beyond), the 
army's strategy seems to be to support the jihadis to further 
perceived national interests. Unfortunately, these interests have 
never been openly debated before being made the basis of our flawed 
foreign policy.

Basically, the focus of our worldview has shrunk to Kashmir, and 
everything else has become subordinate to this one-point agenda. 
Since there has been no progress on the diplomatic front, and the 
balance of power between Pakistan and India is steadily tilting in 
our neighbour's favour, the establishment sees no alternative to 
supporting jihadi elements as a means to drawing international 
attention and putting pressure on India. But ten years of this 
policy have yielded no positive results. If anything, the Kargil 
fiasco has given India an excuse to harden its position as well as 
make a massive investment in modernizing its armed forces. And the 
bomb blasts in our major cities is an unpleasant reminder that 
there is no such thing as a free lunch.

Given the army's rigid mindset, it is difficult to change the 
course of a policy, even if it has clearly failed. Our support for 
jihad may not have any electoral support and the bulk of our 
population may be indifferent to the unending Kashmir issue, but 
the policy nevertheless is sustained by significant figures and 
powerful institutions. Politicians, wary of antagonizing the 
fearsome defence establishment and the intelligence apparatus as 
well as the small but vocal fundamentalist lobby, fall into line 
and make the usual pro-jihad noises. Right-wing journalists and 
publications are generally gung-ho on the issue. So given this 
nexus of interests, it is difficult to see how the jihad juggernaut 
can be halted.

The only force that can concentrate these closed minds is the 
steady deterioration in the economy that can be linked directly to 
our disastrous foreign policy and its accompanying defence posture. 
And at the heart of these policies lies the concept of jihad as a 
solution to our external and internal problems. In other words, we 
will continue on our present course until we can no longer afford 
to pay the high cost of jihad.

<a name="repl">Replacements unavailable for senior cricket players</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 25: Chairman Pakistan Cricket Board Lt-Gen Tauqir 
Zia has said that there are no immediate replacements available for 
senior players in Pakistan team.

Talking to reporters at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, 
the general maintained that when he took over impression was given 
that there are plenty of youngsters ready to replace senior 
players.

"But, I have got the rude shock that there are no immediate 
replacements available for senior players," he said.

What is available is not up to international standard and require 
technical grooming before they can represent the country, the 
general said while giving the example of Hasan Raza, Irfan Fazil, 
Yasir Arafat etc. Similar results will be given by other promising 
youngsters like Zahid Saeed, Mohammad Sami etc. because these 
cricketers need to get their techniques right.

The general said the remedy and only hope for improving the 
situation is the national academy which would start functioning 
form from the first week of November at Lahore.

 Thirty promising youngsters are being shortlisted who would be 
trained in all aspects of cricket in this initial phase. Six or 
seven coaches -experts in physical training, fielding, batting, 
various bowling types, psychological grooming etc- will be hired to 
undertake the assignment. Four pitches have been prepared for the 
purpose to start the academy.

 KARACHI, Oct 22: Pakistan's top cueist Saleh Mohammad, topped 
Group H in the IBSF World Snooker Championship, when he toppled 
Chan Wai Kai from China Hong Kong 4-1 at Changchun China, according 
to a message received here on Sunday.

Chan Wai Ki, fancied to top the group began well scoring 62 points 
in the opening frame before Saleh could open his account.

Unperturbed with the situation, Saleh got his act together and 
chalked up a splendid break of 80 which enabled him to take the 
early lead 1-0.

Another break of 43 in the next frame saw Saleh sail ahead 2-0 and 
he then had his reputed opponent on the ropes by picking up the 
third frame also.

Completely mesmerised, Chan Wai Ki managed to save face by pinching 
the fourth frame 98/14, laced with a break of 44. But Saleh on for 
the kill was just brilliant in the fifth, winning the frame 93/0, 
with the help of 36 points on the trot.

Although Saleh was beaten 4-1 by Welshman Edward Davies in his 
third match of the Group, the fighting Pathan bounced back to perch 
himself on top.

 Yousuf beat Serge Das from Belgium 4-1, as he took the third spot 
in Group D behind Praput Chaithanasskun from (Thailand) and J.B. 
Johannesson.

Although he notched up a break of 36 in the opening frame, Yousuf 
ended up on the losing side 65/75, after a keenly fought encounter.

The Pakistan veteran making his 13th appearance in the World 
championship, used his great skill as he breezed through the last 
four frames with breaks of 35, 41 and 60 in the second, third and 
fourth frames.

<a name="paki">Pakistan inflict an 8-wicket defeat upon England: Afridi excels 
with bat and ball </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

LAHORE, Oct 27: Pakistan inflicted an eight-wicket defeat upon 
England in the second one-day International played under 
floodlights at the Qadhafi Stadium here on Friday before a packed 
to capacity house.

Pakistan levelled the three-match one-day international series 
without sweating after Shahid Afridi became the seventh player in 
the world and second Pakistani after Abdur Razzaq to take five 
wickets and hit a half century in limited overs games.

The 20-year-old newly married Pathan captured five wickets for 40 
runs as England were restricted to 211 for nine on a perfect 
batting pitch and in ideal conditions. Afridi then stroked 61 as 
Pakistan avenged Tuesday's five-wicket defeat with a thorough 
professional performance by overhauling the target with 5.4 overs 
and eight wickets to spare.

It was Pakistan's biggest victory over England in terms of wickets 
which was later celebrated with a spectacular fireworks.

Pakistan always looked like a team on a mission when they fielded 
superbly and bowled intelligently to entertain a festive and 
cheerful full house.

Pakistan captain Moin Khan showed class with two smart stumpings 
while accounting for three batsmen behind the wickets to take his 
tally of victims to seven in two matches.

If Moin had looked perplexed on Tuesday, he appeared cool and 
composed on Friday and emphasised on containment by placing the 
fielders at right positions.

His best role for the team was to win the all important toss.

After a 66-run start by the Englishmen, Moin introduced Mushtaq 
Ahmad in the 12th over and the baby-faced former Somerset bowler 
provided the breakthrough on his very first delivery by having Alec 
Stewart (22) stumped.

As the second wicket partnership between skipper Nasser Hussain and 
opener Marcus Trescothick looked like entering the danger zone, 
Moin brought in Shahid Afridi who struck with his fifth delivery to 
end the 50-run stand. He terminated the innings of Trescothick who 
scored a 74-ball 65 with five boundaries and a six.

Moin, who had replaced Afridi despite first spell figures of 4-1-
18-1, recalled him for the second and Afridi justified the 
confidence of his captain with three wickets in nine balls as 
England later order collapsed like a pack of cards.

>From a respectable score of 116 for one, England crumbled to 211 
for nine by losing eight wickets for 95 runs in 24.1 overs. In 
fact, in the last 10 overs, England scored just 34 runs at the cost 
of five wickets. England, it may be recalled, had utilized the wet 
conditions in Karachi by scoring 56 in the last 7.2 overs.

Nasser Hussain, amidst a disappointing performance shortly after 
having successfully chased 304 three days back, stood tall by 
following up his Karachi's 73 with 54 that included five boundaries 
off 89 deliveries.

While Afridi, later adjudged Man-of-the-Match, concentrated on 
keeping the ball in three sticks with little spin, Saqlain Mushtaq 
and Mushtaq Ahmad spun the ball enough to leave the tourists 
guessing. The duo shared three wickets between them but the most 
important thing they did was to exploit England's fragility against 
quality spinners.

Of the nine England wickets, eight were captured by the spinners 
which would certainly serve as a warning to the tourists as to what 
lay ahead in the three-Test series which, interestingly, starts 
here from Nov 15.

England's modest 211 for nine was never a threatening score. But 
the target was made even smaller after Shahid Afridi and Saeed 
Anwar laid the founddation for a convincing win by featuring in a 
76-run opening wicket stand.

Both batted with conviction, authority and stroked the ball in gaps 
to bring the fans on their feet. Saeed was graceful as always 
canning four boundaries in his 59-ball 44.

But it was Shahid Afridi who clubbed eight blistering fours and a 
towering six off Ashley Giles to score his 61 from 69 balls to 
complete the match with a performance which any great allrounder 
would be proud of. Afridi belted a six and then followed up with 
three consecutive boundaries to reach his career's 14th half 
century from 54 deliveries.

After Afridi departed with a leading edge off Giles, an in-form 
Salim Elahi and Yousuf Youhana made sure that Pakistan reached 
victory without any further damage by featuring in an unbroken 91-
run third wicket partnership. They played shots which confirmed 
that Pakistan's batting future is in safe hands.

Salim, who earned the selectors nod over Imran Nazir, remained 
unbeaten on 59 with seven boundaries. Salim's fourth half century 
would surely confirm his place in the team after being in and out 
recently. Salim scored his career's fourth half century off 70 
balls with five fours.

Did not bat: Inzamam-ul-Haq, Abdur Razzaq, Moin Khan, Wasim Akram, 
Azhar Mahmood, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed

Fall of wkts: 1-76 2-123

Bowling: Caddick 10-1-37-0, Gough 10-0-51-0, White 8.2-0-44-0,
