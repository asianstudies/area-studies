<a name="paki">Pakistan not to export Nuclear material, says FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: Pakistan has dubbed a British newspaper report as 
"tendentious" and vowed not to export any sensitive material to any 
country.

A foreign office spokesman in a statement here on Friday reiterated 
Islamabad's unequivocal commitment not to export any nuclear 
materials, equipment or technologies.

He was referring to the report carried by the Guardian on Thursday, 
suggesting that Pakistan is prepared to export sensitive materials 
and equipment contrary to its assurances and public posture against 
such transfers.

"Nuclear activity in Pakistan is restricted to the public sector 
and the question of unauthorized transfer of sensitive materials 
does not arise," he maintained.

He said the export of nuclear-related substances and equipment was 
governed by SRO 782, issued on July 6, 1998, which completely 
prohibited the export of all fissionable materials including 
uranium, plutonium, etc.

He said: "Our export control procedures are vigorously applied. Our 
record is impeccable."

In pursuance of its dialogue with the United States and consistent 
with all International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) norms, he said, 
Pakistan was considering further procedures to strengthen its 
export controls.

The Guardian story, he said, was based on a public notice issued by 
the commerce ministry, published in the local press on July 24 
which was clarified two days later.

According to the clarification, the procedure for the export of 
nuclear-related substances and equipment was still under 
consideration by the relevant ministries and agencies and would be 
made public in due course.

KASHMIR KILLINGS: The spokesman rejected Indian Prime Minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee's accusations that Pakistan was behind the recent 
mass killings in the disputed Kashmir and demanded an impartial 
probe.

Mr Vajpayee has accused "foreigners backed by Pakistan" for the 
gruesome violent acts, in which over 100 people were killed on Aug 
1 and 2 in parts of the held valley, he stated.

He said: "The Pakistan government once again rejects these baseless 
allegations as part of the Indian government's effort to divert 
attention from its own atrocities against the Kashmiri people and 
to malign the Kashmir freedom struggle".

"Pakistan has already condemned the killings of civilians and 
called for an impartial, neutral, and third-party mechanism to 
carry out a full investigation", he said.

He added that India's lack of response to the proposal demonstrated 
clearly that it was only interested in exploiting these incidents 
for propaganda purposes against the Kashmir freedom struggle and 
against Pakistan and had no interest in objective determination of 
the truth.

Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar had expressed on Thursday Pakistan's 
deep shock and concern at the violent incidents and demanded that 
the US should exercise its influence to arrange an international 
impartial inquiry into the incidents which occurred soon after the 
announcement of cease-fire by Hizbul Mujahideen.

<a name="newd">New Delhi begins talks with Hizb nominee: 30 killed in Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring Desk

KARACHI, Aug 1: The process of talks between New Delhi and the 
Hizbul Mujahideen was set in motion on Tuesday as Indian home 
ministry officials contacted the outfit's nominee for negotiations 
here.

Fazal Haq Qureshi, a veteran freedom struggle leader heading the 
Jammu and Kashmir People's Political Front, nominated as the 
negotiator by Hizbul Mujahideen, confirmed that officials of the 
home ministry spoke to him on phone on Tuesday morning.

However, Qureshi refused to divulge details of his interaction with 
the officials but said: "I told them that I am available for 
anybody," according to a PTI report monitored here.

He said he was waiting for "guidelines" from the Hizbul Mujahideen 
to go ahead with the talks with New Delhi. Qureshi said he had been 
in touch with the Hizbul Mujahideen prior to its announcement of 
unilateral ceasefire for three months. "I am in touch with the 
Hizbul Mujahideen as before. Even before they (Hizb) announced the 
ceasefire, I was in contact with them".

APPEAL: The Hizbul Mujahideen appealed on Tuesday to other groups 
to lay down their weapons and urged Indian forces to suspend 
operations in occupied Kashmir, says an AFP report from Srinagar.

In its statement, the Hizbul Mujahideen said: "We appeal to other 
groups to support the ceasefire and we expect the Indian troops to 
suspend their offensive operations against all the groups."

The statement said authorities had been asked to contact a leader, 
Fazal-Haq Qureshi.

BREAKTHROUGH: The sudden and unprecedented truce between India and 
the Hizbul Mujahideen has kindled a flicker of hope for peace in 
occupied Kashmir.

Some believe the developments that have unfolded so rapidly in 
recent weeks could culminate in a meeting between Chief Executive 
Gen Pervez Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee 
at the UN Assembly next month.

That would indeed be a breakthrough given that since last year's 
undeclared war in Kargil, New Delhi has refused to hold talks with 
Islamabad.

But analysts say such hope could easily be snuffed out by New 
Delhi's reluctance to include Islamabad in negotiations on Kashmir, 
and its unwillingness to make concessions on sovereignty.

There could also be an escalation of violence as diehard groups - 
such as Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i-Mohammad - try to undermine the 
unilateral ceasefire implemented by the Hizbul Mujahideen last 
week.

The first evidence came quickly, with the Lashkar-i-Taiba launching 
a fierce attack on an Indian army camp in occupied Kashmir on 
Sunday night.

CURFEW: Meanwhile, an indefinite curfew was imposed on Tuesday in a 
district of occupied Kashmir after the killing of 23 people, 
including five Hindu pilgrims at a crowded marketplace, a police 
official said.

The official said a group of unidentified gunmen swooped on a 
market in Pahalgam, 97kms south of Srinagar, and fired 
indiscriminately at shoppers.

"The Pahalgam market which was targeted lies on the Hindu 
pilgrimage route to the holy Amarnath cave in southern Kashmir. 
That is why the dead and the injured are mainly from the Hindu 
community," said the official.

"This incident could spark off a lot of communal violence. That is 
why we have cordoned off the area and stepped up security."

A team, led by a senior police officer, rushed to the spot as 
people from the Hindu community thronged the streets shouting anti-
Muslim and anti-government slogans outside police stations, 
hospitals and government buildings.

<a name="mush">Musharraf to meet Clinton, Vajpayee at UN summit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider 

NEW YORK, Aug 1: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf would meet US 
President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari 
Vajpayee during the United Nations Millennium Summit here next 
month.

Diplomats and officials here say that besides exchanging 
pleasantries, the leaders of Pakistan, US and India could hold 
bilateral meetings at the sidelines of the summit which will be 
held from September 6 to 8.

The US officials have indicated that they would encourage a meeting 
between Gen Pervez Musharraf and Atal Behari Vajpayee in the 
backdrop of the sudden and unprecedented truce between India and 
Hizbul Mujahideen group which has kindled a flicker of hope for 
peace in Kashmir after a decade of violence and diplomatic 
deadlock. That would indeed be a breakthrough since last year's 
Kargil incident which brought India and Pakistan closer to their 
fourth war, said observers.

Ever since President Clinton's visit to South Asia last March, the 
US officials from the Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot to 
the Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Pickering have asked India 
to transcend Kargil and open dialogue with Pakistan. India has 
steadfastly refused to hold talks. But now that the main condition 
which India stipulated for holding talks has been met it will be 
hard for India to say no to talks with Pakistan, said an official.

"Things have changed dramatically and India would be hard pressed 
to give valid reasons for not engaging Pakistan," officials 
observed adding "without engaging Pakistan there can be no viable 
solution to the Kashmir dispute."

Mr Vajpayee who is scheduled to begin an official visit to United 
States on September 15, would be prompted by the image he would 
convey in the American media specially in the backdrop of reports 
of persecution of Indian minorities, in particular the Christians, 
which has become an issue with the lawmakers at the Capitol Hill.

Vajpayee is expected to address a joint session of US House of 
Representatives and the Senate. The issues of Kashmir, Khalistan 
and persecution of minorities are expected to be raised by US 
senators and congressmen who are being lobbied by their 
constituents in the United States.

When a State Department official was asked by Dawn to comment on 
reports emanating from India and Pakistan that a meeting between 
the Indian and Pakistani leaders could take place in New York 
during the summit, he said "obviously US would support any kind of 
dialogue between the two countries as soon as conditions permit." 
The official pointed out "President Clinton has repeatedly called 
upon India and Pakistan for the renewal of dialogue."

However, the official said that State Department was unaware of any 
American effort towards the proposed meeting, adding "we would 
encourage any peace talks."

Last week when State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker was 
asked about the ceasefire call in Kashmir, he said: "Our position 
on Kashmir is well known. When the president (Clinton) visited 
India earlier this year, he called for mutual restraint, a respect 
for the Line of Control, a renewal or resumption of dialogue 
between the parties with a stand against violence, rejecting 
violence, and making efforts to reduce tension and resolve this 
peacefully. And that will continue to be our position."

<a name="need">Need stressed for third party mediation in Pak-India disputes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Aug 1: Reaffirming Pakistan's position on the Kashmir 
issue the Information Minister, Javed Jabbar, on Tuesday said the 
government was committed to build a "Policy of friendship and peace 
with dignity and honour with India."

Mr Jabbar said this while speaking at a seminar entitled "South 
Asia: Prospects for Peace," which was organized by the Islamabad 
Policy Research Institute and was held at a local hotel. He added: 
"Our government is committed to building policy of peace in South 
Asia including India."

He said that Pakistan had shown its commitment on various occasions 
and referred to the Chief Executive's, Gen Pervez Musharraf, speech 
at the South Asia Media Conference held in Islamabad in which he 
had called for the immediate convening of summit meeting of South 
Asia Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in a bid "to 
dilute the intensity and harshness of bilateral relations."

The minister said that Gen Musharraf had called for the expansion 
of the scope of the SAARC's charter to specifically include 
political dialogues and had also called for the early resumption of 
official dialogue between the two countries.

Mr Jabbar said: "It is an inescapable reality that the Pakistan-
India relationship is the most complex relationship of any two 
nations on the planet. The relationship between Pakistan and India 
go far beyond the Koreas' relations where there is common ground of 
ethnicity and faith, or the relations between the former East 
Germany and West Germany. This has to be the single most difficult, 
intense, deep and multilayered relationship." He added that in view 
of this relationship there was the need for third-party 
intervention to resolve their disputes.

He said that the Kashmir issue cannot be termed as a bilateral 
issue, instead he said: "Kashmir is the first and foremost a 
disputed territory fully recognized by the United Nations as a 
dispute between two sovereign states. Reality cannot be brushed 
aside. However much time goes by, 50 years or another 50 years. You 
cannot rewrite or fabricate what has occurred in history."

He added:"You may wish to bypass Pakistan but Pakistan cannot be 
bypassed. The 130 million of Pakistan have to be taken seriously."

The minister said that All Parties Hurriyet Conference must be 
recognized as the true representatives of Kashmiri people. He 
denied the often repeated Indian allegations that Pakistan was 
sending "infiltrators" into held Kashmir and questioned: "How can 
we infiltrate people through 500,000 or 600,000 troops."

He said that India must realize the "indigenousness of the roots" 
of the freedom struggle. He added: "Kashmir remains the core issue. 
Kashmir has become so deep rooted into the Pakistani psyche that it 
is not going to be possible to deal in any rationale way the 
Pakistan-India relationship unless it is addressed."

He said that even after the Kashmir issue was addressed 
successfully the complexity of the relationship would remain and 
that it would not be easy to manage and would be forever full of 
hazards. He added: "Such a situation poses challenges to us and we 
should be ready to deal with it."

Mr Jabbar said that Pakistan had accepted India as a reality, "We 
have no problem with accepting India. The difficulty in accepting 
has been on the other side and not on our side." In this regard, he 
cited an interview of Quaid-e- Azam with a German journalist on 
March 11, 1948 who stated: "The root of the Pakistan-India 
relationship has to be the principle of equality. The government 
and people of India must recognize that Pakistan is a equal, 
sovereign state that has come to stay."

He said that Pakistan was the only country in the region "which has 
the capacity to effectively neutralize the basic asymmetry in South 
Asia. It was well before the nuclear deterrent came into existence. 
The people of Pakistan know that no force can effectively threaten 
its sovereignty and endurability as a state." He added: "With the 
nuclear deterrent, we can say that despite the fact we have a 
smaller coastline as compared to our neighbour and other 
limitations of our geographic construct, we are in military terms, 
the only country in South Asia that can withstand effectively and 
with credibility, any threat to our security."

Mr Jabbar said that Pakistan was not entirely India-centric and 
said: "It is true that India is the biggest threat to Pakistan's 
security. Yet we are not obsessed by India." He substantiated his 
contention by referring to Pakistan's imperishable bonds of 
friendship with Iran, Middle East, Afghanistan and China.-APP

<a name="chie">Chief Executive for no-war pact with India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, has 
suggested signing of a no-war agreement with India, and said that 
he would hand over power to the civilians according to the deadline 
set by the Supreme Court.

In an interview to the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat, he asked 
India to sign an agreement for preventing wars between the two 
countries instead of New Delhi's insistence on signing a pact on no 
first use of nuclear weapons.

"I will not remain in power after 2002. I will certainly hand over 
power to the civilians, and I do not intend to get involved in 
politics at all".

He said that definite dates for elections had not been decided yet, 
but "these will certainly be held in 2002".

Gen Musharraf ruled out "any serious help" to the US to arrest 
Osama bin Laden. "All that we can do is act through diplomatic 
channels to help Washington and Kandahar resolve their pending 
problems between them," he said, adding "our stand towards Taliban 
is dictated by Pakistan's national interests."

Dispelling impression that his government was mulling over 
establishing diplomatic ties with Israel, he said "this is unlikely 
to happen at present as it is not a priority of the government."

In reply to a question, the CE said: "What I did was not a coup but 
a counter-coup to the coup Nawaz Sharif staged when he dismissed me 
from the army."

In reply to another query, he said: "Full reforms cannot be 
achieved in three years". The reforms are a constant and continuing 
process. "We are acting to rectify the major issues and stop 
deterioration".

The CE denied Nawaz Sharif's accusation that he had interfered in 
his trial. "This is nonsense. The judiciary is independent and no 
one interferes in its affairs."-NNI

<a name="bena">Benazir, Nawaz have no role in politics: Chief Executive</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf said on 
Wednesday that former premiers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif had 
no place in politics, and that he was trying to create a new 
leadership.

In an Internet interview with BBC, the CE said he would meet a 
three-year deadline set by the SC to restore democracy. He denied 
he had set out to victimize the two former prime ministers. But 
both leaders had "tried twice and they failed the nation" in the 
short-lived terms as prime ministers they alternated between them.

"So I am only voicing the concern...and the impression of the 
people of Pakistan that these two have been tested, tried and they 
have failed. They have failed the country and they have no place in 
Pakistan's politics," he said.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz not to challenge Attock court judgment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 1: Nawaz Sharif has decided not to challenge the 
Attock accountability court judgment that has convicted him of 
corruption in the helicopter case, Dawn learnt from sources close 
to the deposed prime minister.

Under the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance the aggrieved 
party can challenge the judgment within 10 days of its 
announcement. The government, too, has decided not to challenge the 
acquittal of co-accused Saifur Rehman. Headed by Judge Farrukh 
Latif, the court had awarded 14 years rigorous imprisonment to 
Nawaz Sharif in the case.

As both Nawaz Sharif and Nab have decided not to challenge the 
verdict, the decision would become final on August 2. Earlier, 
Nawaz Sharif had refused to receive the judgment served through the 
jail superintendent.

He is sticking to his position which he took before the 
accountability court. He had boycotted the proceedings on the 
grounds that since he did not accept the validity of Nab Ordinance, 
promulgated by a "usurper", he would not take part in the trail 
initiated under the same law. He had dubbed the ordinance "Nawaz 
accountability bureau ordinance".

He was also disheartened with the Lahore High Court's order on his 
petition challenging the establishment of the accountability court 
in the 16th century Attock Fort.

"Certain remarks by the members of the (LHC) bench which heard his 
petition, have convinced Nawaz Sharif that verdict of the 
accountability court would remain the same," sources said.

Nawaz Sharif said he had challenged the ordinance in the SC under 
its direct jurisdiction. Nab, he believes, is violative of the 
fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution.

But he was saddened when the apex court did not take up his 
petition filed by Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan a few months back. The 
apex court had announced on May 12 that a number of petitions 
challenging the Nab ordinance were pending, and that they would be 
taken up for hearing at an appropriate time.

<a name="spec">Special bench: Nawaz's plea dismissed by Supreme Court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Aug 4: The Supreme Court dismissed on Friday ousted premier 
Mian Nawaz Sharif's petition against the creation of a special 
bench in the Sindh High Court for out-of-turn hearing of appeals in 
the hijacking case against him.

Sindh Advocate-General Raja Qureshi produced an SHC order saying 
that all criminal appeals, including those filed under the Anti-
Terrorism Act, should be heard speedily even during the summer 
vacation. Due to the shortage of judges, the order made by the SHC 
chief justice said, only one division bench could be set up to hear 
the ATA appeals. A copy of the order was sought by the three-member 
SC bench seized of the ex-PM's petition when the AG submitted on 
Thursday that all ATA appeals were being heard expeditiously and 
that the hearing of the hijack case appeals was not being rushed.

The AG also produced a copy of the SHC rules empowering the CJ to 
constitute benches and assign them cases. He reiterated that the 
hijack case was a case of first impression in that it involves 
commission of the offence by taking control of a plane from ground. 
Only Pakistan law (Section 402 of the PPC) provides for such 
hijacking.

Barrister Azizullah Sheikh, the ex-PM's counsel, rejoined that the 
SHC order produced by the AG did not meet his objection that one 
particular case was being hurriedly disposed of while 40 appeals 
filed under the same law (the ATA) much earlier were awaiting 
hearing. The CJ, he said, may constitute and reconstitute benches 
but he cannot use this power arbitrarily.

As for the interpretation of the PPC provision on hijacking, the 
lawyer maintained that there is an authoritative pronouncement by a 
division bench of the Lahore High Court in the case of Mohammad 
Ibrahim Haleemi alias Abu Abdullah Mohtasib, a Palestinian, 
involving hijacking from ground.

The SC bench comprising Justices Mohammad Arif Chaudhry, Munir A. 
Sheikh and Qazi Mohammad Farooq dismissed the petition after 
hearing the two sides. The petition sought leave to appeal against 
a three-member SHC bench order upholding its constitution to hear 
the hijack case appeals on day-to-day basis. The bench, which 
consists of Chief Justice Syed Saeed Ashhad and Justices Sarmad 
Jalal Osmany and Wahid Bux Brohi, is scheduled to resume hearing of 
the appeals from 15th of this month.

Anwar Saifullah: The SC bench issued notice to the attorney-general 
in a National Accountability Bureau petition for leave to appeal 
against a Lahore High Court order granting bail to former petroleum 
minister Anwar Saifullah Khan. Appearing for the Bureau, 
Prosecutor-General Farooq Adam Khan said the high court had no 
power to grant bail to a NAB accused. 

Notices were also issued in a petition moved by the ex- minister 
for reduction of the bail amount of Rs 20 million. Arguing the 
petition, Advocate Shahid Hamid said the NAB Ordinance empowered 
the high court to grant bail under its Section 24 (D). However, the 
amount of security fixed by an LHC full bench was too high to allow 
the petitioner to avail of the concession.

The bench observed that both the petitions would be heard together 
in Islamabad after summer vacation by a larger bench since the LHC 
bench which granted bail consisted of five members.

<a name="char">Nawaz's charges rejected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, July 31: Information Minister Javed Jabbar has rejected 
allegations levelled against the government by former prime 
minister Nawaz Sharif in his written speech read out at a Pakistan 
Muslim League meeting 
on Sunday.

"We reject all allegations and the extreme language used against 
the government," he said while responding to questions at a 
luncheon meeting with Islamabad-based leading columnists and senior 
journalists on Monday.

"It (written speech) was a strange combination of contradictions. 
We have to sift as to which part of the statement is based on facts 
and which is not."

Mr Jabbar said that on the one hand Mr Sharif had asked his party 
to hold dialogue with the government while on the other, he had 
hurled serious allegations against the government.

He said the present government had not made any attempt to 
persecute or physically torture anybody. "A particular person and a 
clique was involved in corrupt practices. It is one of the most 
important responsibilities of the government to initiate 
accountability," he said and added,"if in that process he (Nawaz) 
had to face some hardship, then it cannot be termed a biased 
attitude."-APP

<a name="info">Information & media development to set up Advisory council soon </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The Ministry of Information and Media 
Development has decided to establish an advisory council on 
information and media development.

This was stated by the Federal Minister for Information and Media 
Development, Mr Javed Jabbar, on Monday. The council will comprise 
prominent citizens and specialists from a broad range of 
disciplines with a particular interest in the field of mass media.

The main objective of creating the council is to enable the 
government in general and the ministry in particular to benefit 
from the vast experience and the valuable insights of private 
citizens from different fields who could provide independent 
critical observations.

The ministry is of the opinion that such a council will help the 
on-going process of formulating a formal and written information 
policy.

The basic principles of the information policy are: strengthening 
the freedom of the Press, introducing private and independent 
electronic media channels, enhancing the professional autonomy of 
the PTV and the PBC, facilitating free flow of information, 
refining existing institutions, establishing new institutions, and 
increasing access of the people to mass media.

The council will meet once a month in Islamabad and the four 
provincial capitals by rotation. The members of the council will 
serve on voluntary basis and will also receive remuneration. The 
ministry will only bear their travel and incidental expenses.

The government will be represented by the Ministry of Information 
and Media Development as the convener of the council.

The Secretary of the Ministry and the Director General of ISPR will 
participate as observers.

<a name="gove">Government-traders contact revived</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The government-traders contact was revived here 
on Monday after the talks between the two sides broke down on July 
26.

Sources in the trade circle told Dawn that the overtures were made 
on Saturday for "an amicable solution to the problems, and for 
breaking the deadlock.

On Monday, a marathon session of the representatives of all the 
major trade bodies from 13 major cities of the country, was held at 
the Rawalpindi Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Sources told Dawn that they discussed the government's offer to 
restart the talks. The government has asked for a package draft 
from the trade bodies.

"We discussed a draft and will hopefully present it at the 26-
member committee of the trade bodies meeting here on Tuesday", said 
a senior trade leader.

"We will submit it to the higher authorities. Once this process is 
over, we hope to be talking to these authorities, in three to four 
days", he said.

When asked whether the CBR officials have been involved in this 
process, he said: "They (CBR officials), according to our 
information, will join us after once we have met the authorities", 
he added. The draft, he added, included a tax payment system which 
would be similar to the fixed tax scheme, evolved by the CBR in the 
shape of development tax, last year.

The finance ministry spokesman, Dr Waqar Masud, told Dawn that the 
government did contact the trade leaders and "this time we are 
inviting a larger group of them to talks."

When asked whether the government's negotiating team (at talks on 
July 25-26) had taken up the issue of two per cent turnover tax and 
its clubbing with the income tax, with the higher authorities, he 
said: "We did take it up with the higher authorities (supposed to 
be the chief executive).

About the proposed fixed tax scheme of the traders to which the 
government has already expressed its aversion, he said: "Let us see 
what they come out with; talks will, in all circumstances, 
continue; it will be an un-interrupted process" he said.

<a name="talk">Talks with traders on Saturday on fixed tax payment formula </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: The talks between the government and the trade 
bodies for a fixed tax-payment formula will be held on Saturday, 
official sources told Dawn Wednesday.

The talks will be initiated if the trade bodies agree to certain 
modalities of payment meant to secure achievement of a revenue 
target set for the retail sector, sources said. The nominees of 
both the sides will first negotiate, on Thursday or on Friday, to 
finalize a draft formula for the scrutiny of a technical committee 
to be set up by Saturday.

The committee, will be "fully empowered to give shape to the 
amendment in the law for the fixed tax scheme to be applicable to 
the retail sector below the annual turnover of Rs5m. "The 
modalities will be such that if the trade sector did not help 
achieve the target, the scheme will be scrapped", said a senior 
official.

The package will be based on a combine of sales tax and income tax. 
The rates of the two will be reduced for the specific sector and 
clubbed together for one-time clearance of the liability- the mode 
of payment to be set up differently from those applicable under the 
normal circumstances.

The sources also said that the rate of income tax will be fixed 
somewhere between Rs 0.25-0.75, and that of sales tax at 0.5%. 

 The retailers in 13 major cities will be allowed to avail the 
immunity from physical verification of the income-source records in 
case of making declarations under the Self-Assessment Scheme.

"This will satisfy the demand of trade bodies to do away with the 
new policy in which basic SAS-based immunity is not available to 
trade sector in 13 major cities", sources added.

They said the committee will be comprised ministry of finance/CBR 
officials and the representatives of the trade sector and it will 
be empowered to deal with issues relating to net revenue generation 
from the scheme. 

 "It will also finalize a strategic component of the scheme which 
will make it binding upon traders to pay dues under the formula" , 
they added.

When asked whether such a scheme will be floated during August, a 
CBR official said: "Already much precious time has been lost in 
deciding whether the provisions of the Finance Ordinance 2000 are 
to be followed strictly. There is no provision for fixed tax under 
this ordinance. However, revival of a fixed scheme has been allowed 
as businessmen with turnover up to Rs5m have been offered a 2% 
Turnover Tax package. 

So why not allow another scheme, and settle the issue which has so 
far prevented the government and traders from striking a deal", he 
said.

<a name="modi">Government modifies devolution plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: The National Reconstruction Bureau has modified 
its devolution plan, to be unveiled by the chief executive on Aug 
14, to accommodate provincial governments' demand for a neutral 
administrative machinery under the district mayor.

Sources told Dawn that following objections from the provincial 
governments the NRB has amended its plan to allow chief secretaries 
to appoint the district police chief, district coordinating 
officers (DCO), and other senior officials in the district 
government.

The chief mayor, who is called district mayor under the modified 
plan, will not be the appointing authority for such officials.

The provision of ratification of such appointments by the district 
assembly has also been rubbed out from the original plan. The 
original plan had authorized the district mayor to make such 
appointments and the district assembly was authorized to ratify 
them by a two-thirds majority.

However, the NRB is still insisting that the two-thirds majority of 
the district assembly should have the right to remove the DCO, but 
provincial governments believe it will lead to the worst form of 
politicization in the bureaucracy.

The annual confidential report of the DCO will be written by the 
chief secretary whereas the counter-signing authority will be the 
district mayor.

The NRB also quashed the earlier condition of holding run-off 
elections for the district mayor and deputy mayor in the planned 
district governments. Provincial governments and some other 
authorities had opposed the idea and insisted that the candidate 
who would bag the maximum votes should be declared successful.

In the original plan, the NRB had said that when no candidate for 
elective office received more than 50 per cent of the votes, the 
election authority would within one week conduct a run-off election 
between the two candidates who polled the highest number of votes.

The NRB has also made certain additions with regard to the 
qualification of candidates for the district mayor and also for 
members of the district and other assemblies.

It has proposed that the candidates contesting for the slot of 
district mayor and deputy mayor should, at least, be graduate 
whereas the minimum qualification for members of the assemblies 
should be fixed at intermediate.

There has also been a lot of opposition to the proposed allocation 
of 50 per cent seats for women in the district, tehsil and Zila 
assemblies but the NRB has decided not to compromise on this issue.

<a name="wome">Women to get 33% seats: NSC, cabinet opt for separate electorate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: A two-day joint meeting of the National Security 
Council and federal cabinet, which started here on Friday, decided 
to fix 33% seats for women in the proposed district governments and 
hold elections on separate electorate basis, Dawn reliably learnt.

The meeting will finalize the devolution plan, which is to be 
announced by Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf on Aug 14.

The first session put off till Saturday the discussion on other 
issues, including the question whether the police should be placed 
under the administrative control of district mayors or under the 
proposed police safety commission.

The National Reconstruction Bureau chairman Lt-Gen (retd) Tanveer 
Naqvi, who presented the plan, suggested that the police should be 
under the control of district mayors who would be an elected person 
and accountable before the district assembly.

Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider, however, differed with him and 
insisted that they should be under the proposed police safety 
commission which would also have public representation.

Gen Musharraf put off the discussion on the issue till tomorrow, an 
official said.

In the original plan the NRB had proposed that women should be 
given 50 per cent representation in the district governments. 
However, in view of reservations, expressed by some members of the 
NSC, the meeting decided to reduce the number of seats to 33 per 
cent as recommended by Beijing conference, he said.

The issue, whether the elections should be held on joint or 
separate electorate basis, was also discussed thoroughly and 
finally it was decided not to change the existing system.

In the existing system, minority communities elect their members 
for special seats reserved for them.

Later an official statement said the meeting was attended by NSC 
members, the federal cabinet, governors, four corps commanders, and 
some senior officials of the army, the election commission, NADRA, 
NRB as well as chief secretaries.

Initiating the deliberations, the chief executive commended the 
efforts and hard work done by the NRB in preparing the plan, which 
will empower the people by making the system of governance directly 
responsive and accountable to them.

The plan proposes strategic and far-reaching changes in the local 
government system in order to lay the foundation of enduring and 
participative democracy and good governance.

The proposals on devolution, originally announced on March 23 by 
the chief executive, have been widely debated all over the country 
during the past four months.

The governors, NSC members, the federal and provincial cabinets 
have also consulted a cross-section of the people throughout the 
country. Over 1,600 written analysis have also been received. The 
print and electronic media have also projected a comprehensive 
debate on the plan.

<a name="crac">Crack down on bookmakers recommended </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Aug 1: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suggested to 
the government for a crack down on bookmakers. Lt Gen Tauqir Zia 
said the suggestion was made about two months ago and expected that 
the raids would begin in the near future.

"We have been provided with all the details of the leading bookies 
in Pakistan. If we manage to get hold of them, we would be able to 
unearth more information besides helping the game of cricket by 
keeping the people from harming the sport," he said.

He said he had a meeting with President Rafiq Tarar on May 25 in 
which he had suggested this move, arguing that it would help 
control the menace of match-fixing.

"Frankly speaking, match-fixing or betting cannot be eliminated. 
But it can be controlled. Elaborating the steps taken by the PCB, 
the general said mobile telephones have been banned in the dressing 
room and the telephone calls in the hotel would come through the 
team manager. He said the players have been banned from night-outs. 
He admitted that there have been one or two incidents where the 
players were reported to be attending parties. "But they were minor 
issues and have been tackled."

"It has been decided in principle that the Pakistan team during 
series' would only attend two functions - receptions by the local 
cricket association and Pakistan Embassy/High Commission."

To another question, Tauqir Zia said the PCB has received four 
audio cassettes of Salim Malik's alleged interview with News of the 
World. He said quality of three cassettes was very poor. However, 
he refused to given details of the fourth cassettes which he 
admitted was audible.

The general admitted that the transcripts available with the PCB 
were very damaging and contained Malik's remarks about the 
honourable judge. But he said the transcripts have so far not been 
provided to Justice Qayyum. He, nevertheless, said they would be 
made available to the judge.

SALIM MALIK: The PCB chairman said Salim Malik has been given 15 
days to inform the board whether he was contemplating appealing 
against the life ban imposed on him. He said the deadline for the 
reply expires on Friday.

<a name="alte">Alternative to IMF loans ready: SBP chief</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Aug 1: State Bank on Tuesday said it had prepared an 
alternative plan if the International Monetary Fund (IMF) refuses 
to approve loans following a crucial post-budget review.

"If we cannot make a deal with the IMF, we have prepared an 
alternative to cope with the situation," State Bank Governor Ishrat 
Husain told AFP, without elaborating on the details of the plan.

An IMF team is expected to visit Pakistan by the middle of this 
month to discuss a loan under the Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Fund.

"We are not going to disclose our alternative plan till finalizing 
the talks with the IMF," he said.

Pakistan hopes to get up to 2.5 billion dollars in loans from the 
IMF to help pay off massive debt servicing bill.

Pakistan needs about six billion dollars to cover interest on its 
debts due in 2001 but its forex reserves are hovering around 1.1 
billion dollars.

Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz has said he hopes the first tranche 
of the proposed IMF package, the details of which have not been 
disclosed, will be made available by the end of September.

Analysts said they could see no sign that the central bank had any 
contingency plan if the funds were not approved.

The 2000-2001 budget targets a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of 
gross domestic product, well below last year's 6.1 per cent.

<a name="300f">300 flour mills threaten closure</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Aug 1: About 300 millers of Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan 
are closing down their flour mills on Saturday to protest against a 
Punjab government decision, forbidding them from buying wheat 
directly from farmers and allowing its mills to supply the flour to 
the three provinces.

"We are holding a meeting of the millers from the three provinces 
in Karachi on Wednesday to formalize the decision of closing down 
our mills from Saturday", Malik Nazir, Chairman of Pakistan Flour 
Mills Association, (PFMA) Sindh zone said.

Mr Nazir, during a visit to Dawn's office here on Tuesday with 
Anwar-ur-Rehman, a former chairman of the association, explained 
that the soaring price of wheat - Rs9,500 a ton in the open market 
in Karachi - had rendered their operations non-feasible.

The Sindh government, too, is not releasing the subsidised wheat to 
the 126 millers in the province who are now forced to buy it from 
the open market where prices are going up.

The two leaders of the millers made it clear that from Saturday the 
flour price in the open market would be Rs12 a kilogram. The price 
of chakki atta, considered to be a premium quality, would be Rs15.

The millers argue that they should be allowed to buy the commodity 
direct from the farmers. It will have two impacts, they believe. 
Firstly, they will get wheat at a lesser price. Secondly, the wheat 
price in open market in Punjab will go up and the farmer there will 
get a fair deal without intervention of the Punjab government.

Early this month, the federal government had decided to increase 
the supply of subsidised wheat to 6.72 million tons from 6.13 
million tons to 724 flour mills in all the four provinces.

However, the quota of 450 mills of Punjab was increased and the 126 
mills of Sindh were refused any increase.

The government has provided loans of Rs37 billion at 16 per cent 
mark-up to the provincial authorities in Sindh, Balochistan and 
NWFP to enable them buy wheat from Punjab after refusing the 
millers to make direct purchases.

<a name="asia">Asian Bank to provide $150m loan: Micro finance sector</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, July 31: A high-level meeting chaired by Chief Executive 
Gen Pervez Musharraf on Monday was told that the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) was expected to offer $150m for micro finance sector 
including the recently established Micro Finance Bank (MFB).

"The government has provided Rs one billion equity for the MFB 
while $150m were likely to be extended by the ADB for the micro 
finance sector as well as for the Bank", said Additional Secretary 
and the Spokesman of Ministry of Finance, Dr Waqar Masood Khan.

He told Dawn the meeting was informed that the MFB will be the most 
important instrument for the poverty reduction strategy. He said 
that the ADB was also expected to provide technically assistance to 
remove poverty from the country.

Chief Executive appreciated the efforts put in by all concerned to 
conceive and implement a strategy aimed at assisting the poor 
becoming masters of their own destiny. He said the government was 
committed to the implementation of a policy supported by concrete 
financial measures, so that any poor person prepared to work for 
his own betterment and uplift does not face problems of raising or 
arranging capital and credit. He said the key to the success of the 
MFB was selection of persons on merit who were prepared to devote 
time and energy for the betterment of the people and not simply job 
seekers.

The chief executive directed the participants, including the 
Finance Minister, Shaukat Aziz, Secretary General finance, Moeen 
Afzal and senior officials of the Micro-Credit Bank to focus on the 
less developed areas and take steps to encourage spirit of 
participation among the people who would benefit from the scheme. 
He said the Micro-Credit Bank was not merely a bank by another name 
but an important partner of the people in projects for their uplift 
and wellbeing. Ghalib Nishtar, Chairman, Micro Finance Bank gave a 
presentation to the meeting apprised the participants about the 
scope and objectives of Micro-finance including challenges, 
mythology, business strategy, milestones and progress achieved so 
far.

Nishtar informed the participants that 70% of the poor population 
live in rural areas and so far only 5% of their requirements are 
met through the formal and semi-formal sector. He dwelt at length 
on effectively meeting the requirements of the poor and the 
creation of a delivery system of financial services to them.

Nishtar said the Micro-Finance Bank was based on the participatory 
development paradigm with the aim of reaching the poorest, 
educating and training them as well as promoting the fraternity of 
members.

He gave out the measures undertaken for establishing the 
institution which included preparation of business and financial 
models, signing of MoUs with Asian Development Bank and other 
strategic partners, approval of legislation by the Cabinet,

<a name="sbpc">SBP cuts yield on FCY deposits</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, July 31: The State Bank on Monday announced slashing of 
15-20 basis points in the rates of return it would offer on foreign 
currency deposits of banks in August.

The SBP said it would give 4.60 and 4.30 per cent return on three-
month and one-month deposits instead of 4.80 and 4.50 per cent 
respectively. It said one-week deposits would attract 4.10 per cent 
return instead of 4.25 per cent.

Senior bankers say the decision is aimed at forcing banks to lend 
their foreign currency deposits in the domestic market or use the 
same for dollar-rupee swap between themselves. But they say there 
is little chances for the banks to do either of the two. "Domestic 
lending in foreign currency is very difficult for the banks because 
there are almost no good borrowers," said head of treasury of a 
leading foreign bank.

"Exporters do not want to borrow in foreign currency because they 
can do it only against future export proceeds and have to convert 
the borrowed amount into rupees," explained the banker.

"So far importers are concerned...only multinationals can be 
expected to borrow in foreign currency...but most of them have the 
facility of borrowing from overseas through their principal 
offices."

Bankers say the very reason that there are not many borrowers of 
foreign currency in domestic market refrains banks from using 
foreign currency deposits for dollar-rupee swap between themselves. 
"When we swap dollar for rupee you do it to meet some commercial 
transactions. If a banks swaps dollar for rupee where on earth he 
would use these dollars when there are no borrowers around?" 
questioned a banker.

If using foreign currency deposits in the domestic market is so 
difficult what else the banks can do with them particularly when 
they are not supposed to employ them abroad. "The answer is they 
should continue placing these deposits with the State Bank and get 
whatever return it offers," says treasurer of a state-run bank. 
That is where the crux of the problem lies.

Banks are earning a cool return of up to two per cent through 
placement of foreign currency deposits with the SBP after paying 
1.0-2.0 per cent return to the holders of these deposits and 
meeting operational cost. But this is leading to further 
dollarization of economy without the economy being directly 
benefited with it. That is why many bankers feel that the rate-cut 
announced by the SBP is aimed at discouraging mobilization of 
foreign currency deposits any more.

"We think the rate-cut would continue till the time when banks 
would find it difficult to pay any interest on foreign currency 
deposits forcing its growth to stop," said head of a local bank.

<a name="imfo">IMF objects to import of industrial inputs: Undocumented facility</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: IMF experts have objected to the facility of 
undocumented trade of industrial raw materials allowed in Pakistan 
on payment of 1.5% extra sales tax under the Finance Ordinance 
2000.

According to official sources, the objection "of serious nature" 
has been communicated to the Central Board of Revenue after 
examination of the changes made in the tax structure in Federal 
Budget 2000-2001, over the last one month. "They have objected to 
this facility as the rate of extra sales tax has been reduced in 
the new budget from 3% last year to 1.5% for the new financial 
year, and that Pakistan is the only country with such a huge volume 
of undocumented industrial inputs", said a senior CBR official.

The IMF experts have pointed out that more than 90% of 350,000 tons 
of plastic industry's raw materials annually imported falls into 
the hands of fake buyers, who sell it to the manufacturing units 
evading taxes and duties by keeping their inputs undocumented.

They have pointed out to the CBR that while on the one hand the 
government is conducting the documentation survey, on the other 
hand it has allowed trade of undocumented industrial raw materials 
only by paying 1.5% extra sales tax to the unregistered buyers, 
from whom the tax-evading manufacturing sector purchases these 
materials for keeping the inputs undocumented, which also helps 
evade income tax.

These raw materials are imported by commercial importers and used 
by sectors which have been listed by the CBR for being the top tax-
evading manufacture sectors of the country. CBR investigations 
reveal that most of the tax evasion they commit is with the help of 
commercial importers from whom they receive undocumented raw 
materials.

CBR officials, when asked what they are doing to plug this evasion 
and satisfy the observation made by the IMF experts, told Dawn that 
a summary had been moved by the Sales Tax Wing to do away with the 
large scale evasion, after scrutiny of a number of reports 
indicating raw materials' disposal in specified sectors.

The summary for proposal to ban this trade was based on reports and 
their due verification by the CBR, both from the industrialists and 
the sales tax collectorate officials.

The IMF experts have also pointed out that the organized sector, 
which forms only about 10% of the total of the manufacturing 
sectors of plastics, steel, textiles and tanneries, have been 
subjected to severe auditing due to their being documented in all 
aspects, while the unorganized sector has been allowed to occupy 
90% of the trade in raw materials by paying only 1.5% extra sales 
tax.

Notice has also been taken of a number of complaints from the 
relevant associations of the industrialists in the organized sector 
who have been complaining that their units were being rendered 
uncompetitive due to the sale of industrial raw materials to 
unregistered persons. This trade at cheaper prices (due to being 
non-tax-paid) has impacted the organized sector to the extent that 
many of them are near closure.

When the attention of the relevant CBR officials was drawn toward 
the fact that delay in introducing a pronounced ban on trade of 
undocumented sale of raw materials in these specified industries 
would retard the industries, they said a number of proposals are 
being examined in this connection. The chief proposal was to ban 
sale of these raw materials to persons who do not hold 
manufacturing licence and sales tax registration number, but the 
CBR's officials said "it would be against the spirit of self-
assessment and free trade under the sales tax laws, which do not 
allow imposition of such restrictions.

<a name="newt">New Tax Amnesty Scheme on 5th August</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The Central Board of Revenue will announce the 
new tax amnesty scheme-2000 on Aug 5, say CBR sources. The scheme 
will, be applicable with immediate effect. The CBR officials told 
Dawn Monday the rate of tax for whitening the undeclared 
assets/incomes etc will be finalized in a presentation to the 
finance minister in a day or so.

Three rates have been suggested: 12.5%, 13% and 15%. "Most 
probably, the 13% tax rate will be accepted as applicable", said an 
official who added that the declarants will be given two months 
time to declare incomes, assets etc.

When asked what will be the treatment of assets and incomes 
declared through the scheme but have been declared through the 
survey forms as well, the source said: "those assets and incomes 
declared through survey forms, cannot be declared for availing of 
the concessional rate of tax under the second TAS-2000".

When asked how will the CBR know whether such assets and incomes 
have already been declared through forms, the officials said a 
provision is being inserted into the scheme to make it binding upon 
the declarants that, while submitting the TAS declaration form, 
they should attach a photo copy of the survey form already 
submitted. This would help the CBR to ascertain whether double 
declarations have been made.

"If we allow double declarations of the same assets and incomes, 
this will jeopardize the entire exercise of survey which is meant 
to expand the net and avail tax amounts as per the operative rate, 
and not at the concessional rate", said a senior official.

He said that though the government has not set a target of tax 
collection and volume of assets and incomes, "we hope that this 
time the declarants will receive the scheme with the same fervour 
and avail of its benefits due to two reasons: firstly, the survey 
is going on through which declarations will be taxed at the normal 
(non-concessional) rate, and this would be an opportunity to 
declare at a concessional rate. Secondly, the post-survey scrutiny 
of the incomes and assets to be conducted, which is indicated from 
the kind of declarations required to be made through survey form, 
is going to be thorough enough to help dig out incomes and assets 
kept undeclared even through the survey form", he added.

Other CBR officials indicated that the government is considering to 
create a mechanism in the post-survey (of 13 major cities) for 
maintaining records of assets, turnover, assets and holdings on 
city, locality and ownership basis.

 "This will be a kind of watchdog on movement of finances and 
materials, investments and profiteering through black market", they 
said. "The CBR will seek cooperation of banks, development finance 
institutions and private sector companies keeping records on 
investments and transactions, finance-based litigation etc, in this 
connection".

<a name="gold">Gold prices move up as rupee falls</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Aug 2: Prices of gold have risen sharply in Karachi and 
Lahore respectively after the removal of the cap on inter-bank 
exchange rates on July 20.

On 20th July 24 caret gold was selling for Rs4980 per 10 gm in 
Karachi and for Rs5040 in Lahore: on Aug 2 the rates rose to Rs5050 
and Rs5075 respectively.

In Lahore, gold was selling for Rs5150 per 10 gm on Tuesday but on 
Wednesday the price fell dramatically to Rs5075. But bullion 
traders said the fall was temporary adding that the price would 
soon hit back past Rs5100.

"One reason for gold prices moving up is that the dollar has become 
dearer in the inter-bank as well as in open market," said chairman 
of All Pakistan Gem Merchants and Jewellers Association Kamran 
Khan.

He said gold importers purchase dollars from the open market to 
finance their imports and as such any change in exchange rates 
reflects in the local prices of gold.

<a name="stoc">Stocks, sale checking from 25th August</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: The on-the-spot checking of stocks and sales of 
the trade and manufacturing sectors for matching them with their 
declarations made through the survey forms to be launched on August 
25.

Sources attached to the survey scheme told Dawn here on Friday that 
the physical checking of stocks and sales of the traders and 
factories would be launched after the completion of scrutiny of the 
survey-form based declarations of utilities consumption by the 
residential section.

When contacted, Member Sales Tax, CBR, Sarfraz Ahmad Khan told Dawn 
that scrutiny of utilities bills is going to take another 15-20 
days, after which the physical verification of declarations by the 
business section would "hopefully" be launched.

"The work of physical verification is planned to be completed 
before Sept 30, when the income tax returns are scheduled to be 
filed. The business section filers of IT returns have also been 
offered the option of declaring the hidden stocks through the Tax 
Amnesty Scheme, at a concessional rate. The CBR needs to be updated 
on the stocks and sales for netting those assessees who neither 
declare their hidden stock through the IT returns, nor through the 
TAS, while under-declaring them through the survey forms".

He added that a three-pronged strategy has been prepared for 
completing this work. In the first phase, he said, the survey 
teams' work, presently being carried out in only the posh areas of 
the 13 major cities of the country, is being extended to the non-
posh vicinities of these cities. 

In the second phase, the physical verification of stocks and sales 
of the business sections would be conducted, while in the third 
phase, the survey teams would be asked to expand the scope of their 
work to the non-mega towns, approximately 50.

However, he said, the most important work presently on hand is the 
scrutiny of utilities consumption declarations by residential 
section, which are being matched through the computerized data of 
the utilities companies in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, while in 
other cities, where the data is not computerized, the work is being 
taken up manually.

Apart from this, said Mr Khan, the extension of survey work to the 
other (non-posh areas and smaller towns) is intended to expedite 
declarations of hidden assets. "In areas where the survey is 
currently being conducted, hefty declarations of assets and 
properties etc have been made through the TAS, while in non- survey 
areas these declarations were negligible. Once the survey work is 
extended to non-posh and smaller towns, which we plan to begin 
before the expiry of the present TAS-2000, the TAS would attract 
more attention", he added.

He further said that notices for registration with the Sales and 
Income Tax departments would have to be sent to the non- assessees 
whose sales and incomes, as per their declaration already made 
through survey forms, have been found taxable. They would be issued 
National Tax Number (NTN). "All this work has to be completed by 
the end of September 2000. We are acquiring services of more 
officials to join us in the survey and scrutiny work", said Mr 
Khan.

Other CBR officials told Dawn that the income tax department is 
preparing a strategy to approach the issue of under-declaration of 
incomes by existing IT assessees, and approaching those non-
assessees who, through the survey forms and through their utilities 
consumption charges, enjoy taxable income.

<a name="spec">Special quotas for jobs abolished</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: All special quotas reserved for fresh recruitment 
and contract appointments in the government service have been 
abolished, and it has been decided to fill in the vacancies on the 
regional quota-based merit.

The policy guidelines providing legal cover to special quotas have 
been deleted, according to an official order issued on July 17.

The reservation of 20 per cent of the total number of vacancies for 
direct recruitment for the poor and needy, and another 20pc for 
contract appointments, covered under the office memorandum of Aug 
4, 1999, has been deleted.

All the vacancies would now be filled on merit based on 
regional/provincial quota as protected under the constitution, 
official sources said.

Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the 1999 memorandum have been scrapped by the 
latest order. The para 5 said that 20pc of the total number of 
vacancies earmarked for direct recruitment should be reserved for 
the poor/needy and the disabled.

It said that the selection against the quota for poor/needy and 
disabled people would be made through the prescribed selection 
process, and merits of each case would be determined by the 
selection committee.

Of this 20pc, the earlier order said, 2pc posts would be reserved 
exclusively for the disabled. Such people would be eligible for 
appointment only against the jobs for which their disability might 
not be considered a disqualification, it added.

The para 6 said that 20pc of the vacancies would be reserved for 
contract appointments which would require approval of the prime 
minister.

The contract appointees, the order said, would be eligible for 
regular appointment if they fulfilled the prescribed conditions of 
educational qualification and experience.

<a name="ther">The revelation at hand</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

SO, some of the confusion about Kashmir stands dissipated. A few 
things are revealed more clearly: for one the indigenous nature of 
the Kashmir uprising. India's willingness to talk to the Hizbul 
Mujahideen is tacit admission of the fact that the Hizb belongs to 
Kashmir and is not a creation of the ISI. Otherwise, would India be 
willing to talk to the ISI on Kashmir?

Whether anything comes of the Hizb announcement of a unilateral 
ceasefire - and I am convinced that India eventually will see to it 
that nothing does - it has, at a stroke, laid the ghosts of "cross-
border terrorism" to rest. India will still go on shouting about 
cross-border interference but after acknowledging, if only by 
implication, the Kashmiri roots of the Hizb, it becomes difficult 
to pin the blame for every armed encounter in occupied Kashmir on 
the ubiquitous shoulders of the Pakistan army.

Those accusing the Hizb of rashness are not grasping this point. 
Kargil was a mortal blow to the Kashmiri resistance, obscuring its 
achievements and giving India a propaganda advantage it milked this 
past year for all it was worth. Now at last, whether we recognize 
this or not, the tables have been turned. By having made a peace 
offer which India has accepted, the psychological advantage has 
shifted to the Resistance. The onus is on India now to come up with 
a matching response. Even the Amarnath massacre and the other 
killings in Kashmir in the last few days, unfortunate as all these 
sad events are, have drawn attention to the indigenous nature of 
Kashmir's troubles.

Spread over four decades, a long enough time by any calculation, 
India had the chance to bring Kashmir into the Indian mainstream. 
But it failed. Instead of reaching out to the people it nurtured 
quislings like Farooq Abdullah. If Farooq is not hailed as their 
deliverer by the people of Kashmir, is Pakistan to blame? Pakistan 
tried to manufacture unrest in Kashmir in 1965 (Operation Grand 
Slam and then Gibraltar) and for its pains got a full-scale war it 
had not bargained for. There is nothing foreign about the Kashmiri 
uprising since 1989. The ISI could not have manufactured it even if 
it had the resources of the CIA ten times over. Kargil obscured 
this fundamental reality. The Hizb initiative now restores it in 
its true colours. If the Hizb has done this on its own, it deserves 
a medal for sharp diplomacy. If Pakistan is involved, then GHQ has 
shown an intelligence it has rarely shown in the past. If the 
Americans have anything to do with it, they deserve our thanks.

What is Qazi Hussain Ahmed so miffed about? That after his American 
tour he will be taken for an American puppet? Or that the Hizb 
announced their decision without consulting the Jamaat-i-Islami 
politburo? That's the trouble with us Pakistanis. We can never let 
things be but must try to impress our crude stamp upon them. We did 
this in Afghanistan: trying to remote control the Afghan 
resistance. Had we allowed a true, unified leadership to emerge 
from the chaos of the Afghan war, that unfortunate country might 
have been spared many of its subsequent troubles. We should not be 
walking the same path in Kashmir. If the Chinese had listened to 
Stalin, they would never have got their revolution. The Kashmiris 
will never achieve their aim if they allow themselves to be pushed 
around by outsiders. Qazi Hussain Ahmed should get over his sulks. 
The Hizb announcement is the best thing to have happened to the 
Kashmiri resistance for a long time.

Will anything come of it? I am sure not. India is a big country but 
because it is still trying to climb up the greasy pole of world 
stardom, and because one half of it is stuck in the bullock age 
even as the other half tries to create a path for itself across the 
skies, it lacks the imagination to think big. Its mentality is 
still that of the village chaudhri who wants no diminution in his 
authority because he thinks that any concession, no matter how 
trifling, is an invitation to the peasant to rise in revolt. India 
therefore is incapable of meeting the Kashmiris halfway. If the 
past is any guide, it will try to exploit the Hizb initiative for 
short-term gains, to weaken and fragment the Kashmiri resistance. 
If India cannot stomach autonomy for its quisling, Farooq Abdullah, 
how can it accept tripartite talks which put the future of Kashmir 
on the discussion table? And how can anything less satisfy the 
Hizbul Mujahideen and the other lights of the Kashmiri resistance?

This initiative therefore is destined to wither away. The people of 
Kashmir are destined to suffer some more because they are caught 
between the high mountains and implacable forces. And also because 
the subcontinent lacks the genius of statesmanship. We are clever 
people but often too clever-by-half. Oily and subtle pandits, 
fractious and hair-splitting mullahs, volatile Bengalis: these are 
the dominant subcontinental types. From these types are not 
fashioned the instruments of statesmanship.

If the Congress leadership had been wise, the subcontinent would 
not have split up. After all, the Muslims were not a priori 
separatists and as late as 1946 were ready to go along with the 
Cabinet Mission plan which foresaw a united India. But a 
nationalism based on narrow religious symbolism drove them to call 
for a separate homeland. If the Pakistani leadership had been wise, 
East Pakistan would not have become Bangladesh. With tact and 
imagination on India's part, Kashmir would not be the bleeding 
wound that it is.

With what false arguments is not the Kashmir cause assailed? Forget 
about Kashmir, we are told, and concentrate on development as if 
Kashmir is the difference between perdition and the promised land. 
Suppose, becoming subcontinental Arafats, we gave up on Kashmir. 
Would corruption disappear from our land and would our governing 
elite undergo a conversion on the road to Damascus? Kashmir does 
not stop us from giving a proper education to our kids or from 
cleaning our hospitals. It is not because of Kashmir that our 
affairs are in such a mess.

What has the end of the intifida brought the Palestinians? The 
institutionalization of greed and corruption in the Palestinian 
Authority. What has peace brought Egypt? A certain amount of 
American dollars, not progress in the real sense of the word. In 
the hands of a corrupt ruling class wealth and resources, what to 
talk of a peace dividend, are soon wasted. For proof look no 
further than Nigeria, Indonesia and the oil-rich Arab states.

Even so, let us not forget the schizophrenia of which the people of 
Pakistan are such unsuspecting victims. Ours is a land with a split 
personality, with an elite and a governing class whose concerns are 
aeons away from the heartbeats of the masses. The Pakistanis who 
favour and support the Kashmiri resistance are 'native' Pakistanis, 
not the pseudo-westernized elite which hogs the corridors of power. 
'Native' Pakistanis go in for hopeless causes. Many Pakistanis have 
died in Kashmir. How many of these from the drooling classes?

There was this news item two days ago about a ceremony at the 
headquarters of the Anti-Narcotics Force at which a Ms Sison from 
the US embassy (the Charge d'Affaires) was handing out good 
performance certificates and cash awards, ranging from Rs 25,000 to 
a lakh, to officials of the force. Tough-looking men in army and 
police uniforms gratefully took their awards from Ms Sison (from 
her picture a fetching face). In attendance at the ceremony were 
high-ranking army and police officers.

What business is it of the US embassy to be awarding prizes and 
money to (in other words, infiltrating) a department of the 
Pakistan government? By cracking down on narcotics are we doing a 
favour to the US government? In big matters the US kicks us around 
the way it pleases. If memories are short on this score, Bill 
Clinton's lecture to Pakistan need only be remembered. But in small 
matters we cannot help licking up to the Americans.

In this as in other instances our split personality is at work: the 
wretched of the country ready to lay down their lives for distant 
causes; senior officials of the government conducting themselves in 
a manner which shows up the servility and inferiority complex of 
our governing class. The commitment to Kashmir preserves some of 
our self-respect. Take that away and all we will be left with is 
the batman mentality which distinguishes our national behaviour.

FOR AS long as man exists there will be greed in his world, and, as 
in a case such as ours, the longer he remains uneducated or semi-
educated the greed will grow greater. Today this nation stands at 
140 million strong (or rather weak) and with the uncontrolled 
rabbit-like real birth rate (as opposed to the government's fudged 
figures) it is estimated that by 2020 the figure will increase to 
200 million. Frightening!

This column deals with one battle so far won by the people of 
Pakistan against the gangs of marauders, land and property 
grabbers, desecrators of public lands, and the perpetrators of like 
crimes, and with the aiders and abettors of these criminals - our 
civil and our military governments.

Over half a century ago, in 1947, a man achieved his ambition and 
shortly thereafter died, in the dark of night on September 11, 
1948. Mohammad Ali Jinnah had created a country and lived but 13 
months after so doing. I and millions of others were there, at dusk 
the next day to see him buried on a rocky barren hillock in Jamshed 
Quarters. For years afterwards his grave lay covered by a tent. 
Architects came and went, discussions were held suggestions made, 
draft plans drawn up and destroyed.

In 1956 the Quaid-i-Azam Mausoleum Committee was formed by that 
clever prime minister of ours, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and it 
had the good sense to seek the advice of Khan Bahadur Suleiman, a 
former chief engineer of the Public Works Department of undivided 
India. He called in architect Mehdi Ali Mirza and his junior, the 
young architect Khwaja Zaheeruddin. They did the correct thing. 
They approached the International Union of Architects in Paris and 
set about organizing an international competition for the design of 
a suitable monument. A jury, including men of world renowned 
stature - architect Sir Robert Matthew of Britain, architect and 
designer Geo Ponti of Italy, the famous structural engineer Pierre 
Luigi Nervi also of Italy, architect Eugene Beaudouin of France, 
and architect Georgis Candalis of Greece - was formed to judge the 
entries.

The competition attracted worldwide attention and 57 entries were 
received. In 1958 the jury assembled in Karachi and the design sent 
in by young architect Raglan Squire of Britain was selected as the 
winner. It was a beautiful design, striking in its simplicity, a 
huge concrete flowing canopy. All were in no doubt that it far 
surpassed all others in its perfection.

Then in stepped the obdurate Miss Fatima Jinnah. No domes? No 
minarets? No fancy furbelows? She pulled rank and prevailed upon 
the government of the day to reject Squire's design. At her 
insistence Yahya Merchant, an architect from Bombay was brought in. 
He is the designer of what stands today. President General Ayub 
Khan, fitting in with Fatima Jinnah's wishes, in 1960 approved of 
the design. Construction was started, work progressed at a snail's 
pace until in 1969 President General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan 
appeared on the scene, banged down his swagger stick, and the 
mausoleum was magically completed in December 1970, 22 years after 
the death of the man in whose honour it was conceived.

The main area of the mausoleum (marked A on the sketch and the 
peripheral areas (marked B, C, D and E) were fenced in. A shortage 
of funds, of water, of initiative, and of will ensured that nothing 
was done about the landscaping.

Yahya and East Pakistan fell. Then came the marauding democratic 
governments of the greedy grabbing new political classes. Schemes 
were floated by the politicians, the professional land-grabbers and 
the builders' mafia to commercialize demarcated areas of the Mazar 
land and raise money-making structures. In 1994 the people of 
Karachi got together and formed the Treemazar project, with the 
intent of planting trees in the barren peripheral Mazar areas. This 
newspaper printed articles on the project and help came in cash and 
kind. The land was saved, water supply was organized, trees, 
bushes, shrubs and plants were planted.

In 1999, yet another military government took over, that of General 
Pervez Musharraf. Sleepy but good architect Zaigham Jafery of KDA 
has been revitalized and he and a team of engineers of 5 Corps 
headed by Engineer Brigadier Asif Gazali have been put to work and 
landscaping of all the areas is going on in full swing.

The Treemazar project, its objective achieved, has for the time 
being suspended its tree planting and nurturing operations. The 
people of Pakistan must thank and remain grateful for the time and 
effort dedicated to the project by: Architect Husnain Lotia, Dr 
Ghazala Aziz, Architect Qaisar Colombowalla, Lawyer Mahmood 
Mandviwalla, Agricultural Scientist Mahmood Futehally.

For help in kind, for digging and filling, for material, and for 
land survey, thanks and gratitude go to former chairman of Pakistan 
Steel Mills, Lt-General Sabeeh Qamar-uz-Zaman, Engineer Matlub of 
the PSM and his men who worked on the project. Gratitude also goes 
to former IGP, Sindh, Afzal Shigri, who also put many of his men to 
work in the areas.

We are most grateful to the Zoroastrian Association of Pakistan 
(ZAP), particularly to office-bearers Hutoxy Cyrus Cowasjee, 
Engineer Naval Dinshaw Dastur, for collecting funds and planning, 
planting and nurturing the Ruttie Jinnah Grove (marked E on the 
sketch) and for handing over the completed garden to the Quaid-i-
Azam Mazar Managing Board in March 1999 for further and continued 
upkeep and maintenance.

<a name="just">Justice Ebraheem criticises PCB action against players</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 1: Former Supreme Court judge, Justice (retd) 
Fakhruddin G. Ebraheem, on Tuesday criticized the Pakistan Cricket 
Board (PCB) for taking action against eight top players primarily 
on a recommendatory report.

He also called for an inquiry into the mishandling of the 
publication of Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum Commission report and 
stressed that concerned authorities should be taken to task for 
allowing the release of the document which tarnished the image of 
the country and dmaged the reputation of the cricketers.

He was also critical of Justice Qayyum's recommendations arguing 
that he had suggested penalties against the players despite 
admitting in his report on several occasions that no evidence had 
been found against them.

The former Governor of Sindh, speaking at a seminar on betting and 
match-fixing organized by Helpline Trust, based his opinion on the 
extracts from Justice Qayyum Commission report.

"The report is unbelievable," he said. "In paragraphs number 51, 52 
and 53, the honourable Judge declares Salim Malik `not guilty' and 
still recommends life ban and a cash penalty of Rs one million.

"Wasim Akram has been declared `not guilty' on three charges and is 
still fined and recommended to be removed from captaincy and not to 
be given any post. Similarly, all the players have been penalized 
and censored despite the judge admitting that there was no 
evidence.

Moin available for Singapore series
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 1: Pakistan captain Moin Khan has confirmed his 
availability for the triangular one-day series in Singapore later 
this month.

Talking to mediamen, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB) Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, however, added that he would again have a 
discussion with the wicketkeeper before deciding whether he should 
be allowed to take a risk by plying in the competition. Moin is 
currently in England for his knee treatment.

The general added that vice-captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, Wasim Akram, 
Shoaib Akhtar and Saqlain Mushtaq would not be available.

The PCB chairman said Moin would return from England on Aug 5 and 
that he confirmed his availability a couple of days ago.

He added that Wasim Akram has expressed his willingness to play in 
the five-match series against India at Toronto and then in the 
three-match one-day series against England at home.

No word about Indian acceptance of tour
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Reporter

KARACHI, July 31: No official of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 
was available to confirm if it has received confirmation from the 
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about their team's 
tour later this year.

Yawar Saeed, director of the PCB, had said on Sunday that he was 
hoping to get information from across the border on Monday. But all 
efforts went in vain to contact him to seek clarification.

At least half a dozen calls were made to the PCB secretariat in 
Lahore but every time it was said Yawar Saeed was in a meeting. In 
the evening, this scribe was told Yawar had left office. But he was 
neither available on his mobile telephone nor in the hotel where he 
is staying.

One wonders if it is advisable for the PCB officials to speak on 
matters which are beyond their ccontrol.

<a name="reid">Reid's decision has blotted my career, says Waqar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 3: Pakistan's leading fast bowler Waqar Younis 
admitted on Thursday that he was disappointed by match referee John 
Reid's decision which has left a blot on his distinguished career.

The pacer, who joined the training camp in progress here for the 
Singapore tour after returning from Australia on Wednesday, said: 
"I am obviously disappointed because all my achievements have been 
undone by Reid's decision."

Reid, acting on law 42.5, had suspended Waqar for one match and 
fined him 50 per cent of his match fee "for tampering with the 
ball" in the match against Sri Lanka during the triangular series 
last month.

Interestingly, the two match umpires had given Waqar a clean sheet 
when Reid contacted them on walkie talkie to check the condition of 
the ball. The ball remained in play and was not changed which had 
allegedly breached the law thus casting doubt on the veracity of 
Reid's decision.

"It (suspension) was quite depressing. I have played cricket 
honestly and with dignity. But I am extremely thankful to the 
Pakistan Cricket Board which stood by me and challenged the 
suspension and fine," Waqar, after a lengthy workout in the nets, 
said.

Waqar, who is only the second bowler in cricket history to have 
taken 300 or more wickets in both forms of the game after Wasim 
Akram, urged the board to pursue the case and help him in getting 
his name cleared.

"Words are not enough to express my thanks for the support they 
gave me when I needed most. But I request them to pursue my case 
and help me in getting my name cleared," said Waqar.

He said the PCB should find out from the ICC according to which law 
he had been suspended and fined "because the law which was applied 
contradicts the laid down procedures."

When further pressed on the issue, the speedster said he would 
first seek clearance from the PCB chairman, Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, 
before giving his side of the story as to actually what happened 
during the game.

"I don't want to breach the Code of Conduct. But I can surely say 
that I have been penalized contrary to the laws of the game."

The speed merchant said he hasn't yet decided to be selective on 
the competitions. He said he was looking forward to playing in 
every tournament because that would help him stay in rhythm.

"Since I am a bowler who relies on rhythm, the more I play, the 
better I will get. That's precisely why I am here because I don't 
want to waste any time. I am a different bowler from Wasim Akram 
who depends more on swing and control than pace. If I am not in 
rhythm, I am an extremely expensive bowler.
