This course aims to introduce the varied products of the world's largest
film industry to students with no specialized knowledge of the subject.
<a href="#firs">In the first part </a>of the course, we shall survey the linguistic and
cultural diversity of India, examining how different genres of Indian
film reflect, distort, or utilize this diversity, and contrast them with
Western films on India, the perspectives and presuppositions of which are
often very different.<p>

<a href="#seco">The second part </a>of the course will retrace many of these themes in
greater depth by analyzing the work of Satyajit Ray (1921-1992), the
Indian film-maker Western critics are most familiar with.  We shall show
how the content, style, and objectives of Ray's films were shaped by his
intellectual and cultural contexts.  Ignoring these local contexts, Western
as well as Indian critics have often portrayed Ray simply as a "universal
humanist" or "transnational auteur".  We shall establish that the
universality of Ray's work is dialectically related with its unrelenting
particularism, and cannot be isolated from it.<p>

There will be one lecture-and-discussion every week, and one film, which
will be screened twice.<p>

Requirements: Attendance at lectures and screenings is mandatory. 50% of the
final grade will be based on class participation, and 25% each on two
10-page papers.<br>
While there is no required textbook for the course, the following book is
recommended as background reading: Erik Barnouw and S. Krishnaswamy, Indian
Film, 2nd edn (1980).<p>
