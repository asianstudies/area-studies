<b>490</b> / <i>The Indian Economic and Social History Review 36, 4 
(1999)</i><p>

CHRISTOPHER V. HILL, <i>River of Sorrow: Environment and Social Control in 
Riparian North India, 1770-1994</i>, Association For Asian Studies, 
Michigan, 1997, pp. 200.<p>

Christopher Hill confesses that among the many great rivers which had a 
profound influence on his life, he chose to devote this book to the 
understanding and the analysis of the Kosi river in the Purnia district of 
north Bihar. With Kosi <i>diara</i> as the case study, the author attempts 
to study not only the peculiarities of the Kosi river but also juxtaposes 
it with colonial discourse and orientalism to study the impact of the 
colonial policies on the region.<p>

The Kosi river had been known for its vagaries since at least the 
sixteenth century. In the distant past, and in fact till recent times, it 
has changed its course frequently, devastating the area that came under 
its sway. The Mughal Emperor, Akbar, had pioneered attempts to control it 
by a system of <i>bandhs</i> or embankments. His efforts, however, were 
not very successful. Ruins of Bir Bandit, constructed during the Mughal 
period were discovered in the nineteenth century. The government of the 
East India Company continued the endeavours to tame the river. They 
understood that the only alternative was to dam the river at its source. 
This, however, required an agreement between India and Nepal, which could 
not be reached between the two countries during the Company's regime. In 
the 1790's, the Company had also initiated a process to reclaim the region 
by hiring the services of invalid soldiers<p>

<i>Book Reviews</i> / <b>491</b><p>

who had been injured in military service. By 1799, however, following the 
repossession. of the lands by the Collector in lieu of revenue payments, 
these invalid soldiers were dispossessed of their lands. On all occasions, 
Hill argues, the Company had to succumb to the limitations imposed by the 
unique environment of the river. It was only in 1955, in post-independence 
India under Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, that the Kosi was harnessed with the 
construction of a barrage. Since then, the river has been channelled by a 
series of canals, providing plenty of irrigation patterns throughout north-
east Bihar. While this calmed the Kosi and stopped its channel-hopping, it 
failed to tame the river. In October 1984, the Kosi once again breached 
its eastern embankments, thus inundating villages, washing away crops and 
rendering many homeless.<p>

These strange geographic-ecological characteristics of the Kosi river had 
earned it the epithet `River of Sorrow'. And, such was the effect of Kosi 
on the district of Purnia that even the district stood discredited. This 
is evident from the saying: <i>Na zahar khao, Na mahar khao, marna hai, to 
Purnia jao</i> (Don't eat poison, don't take venom, if you wish to die, go 
to Purnia). These eccentricities and unique characteristics of the Kosi 
river have been discussed with great intensity and depth by Hill. The 
details are interesting and the narrative useful, but it sometimes gets so 
overwhelming that the argument is lost.<p>

The density of data, notwithstanding, Hill makes a few noteworthy and 
valuable generalisations. He argues that although several historical works 
have studied the socioeconomic implications of colonialism and have 
focused on the `imperial subjugation' felt by the people, they have 
completely ignored the idea that the implicit fact of colonial ideology 
was the subordination and transformation of the Indian environment. 
Imperial domination, Hill argues; was so multi-faceted that ecological and 
societal controls were inseparable. Through this study, he focuses on the 
impact of colonial ideology on the landscape. Hill insists that it would 
amount to a violation of the notions of history if a historian separates 
society and politics from the environment. He argues that throughout the 
colonial period, social, political and ecological consequences were 
unalterably interwined. Moreover, the commodification, commercialisation 
and taming of nature were explicitly evident in colonial social control 
and revenue administration. Hill is critical of the `peculiar optimism' of 
the colonial government in controlling the environment and intending to 
transform and manage the terrain of which they had little knowledge.<p>

It is in this context that the author discusses the importance of local 
knowledge and of local informants on whom the Company depended very 
largely for the formulation of its ideas and knowledge. Understanding, 
regulating and adapting to indigenous customs and local knowledge, the 
Company often reinvented and reformulated traditions and patterns. In 
their urge to be better controllers and managers, and to replace the 
native officials, Company officials perceived local institutions very 
differently, alienating the local people and leading to turmoil and 
unrest. All this was visible in Kosi. The author tells us that not only 
did the peasants feel oppressed by the Company's revenue policies but also 
the government<p>

could not address itself to the needs and concerns of the Santal migrants 
and failed to acknowledge the distinct character of the region. The 
colonial attempts, Hill argues, have left behind a violent legacy in the 
Kosi <i>diara</i> which is manifest even today.<p>

The book covers a vast period--1770 to 1994--although the details and the 
narrative are confined largely to the rule of East India Company. 
Information and comparisons with the period immediately following 
independence and contemporary times would have added to the value of the 
book. Nonetheless, the book should interest ecologists, economic 
historians and scholars who study the transition period and the expansion 
of Company power.<p align=right>
