<i>Indian Economic and Social History Review</i></b></font><p>

3.  <b><a name="refe">Referencing Style</a></b><br>
A.  FOR PUBLISHED SOURCES the following examples illustrate the style to be followed:<br>
<b>On first reference:</b><br>
(a) Books.<br>
Bruce Masters, <i>The Origins of Western Economic Dominance in the  
Middle East: Mercantilism and the Islamic Economy in Aleppo, 1600-1750</i>, New York,
1988. pp. 123-28. <br>
(Note: Publishers' names are not to be cited.)<br>
(b) Edited Volumes
C.W. Troll, ed., <i>Muslim Shrines in India: Their Character, History and Significance</i>, Delhi, 1989.<br>
(c) Articles in Journals:<br>
Gavin Hambly, 'A Note on the Trade in Eunuchs in Mughal Bengal', 
<i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i> (hereafter JAOS), Vol 94 (1),1974, pp. 125-29.
(Note As illustrated in this example, the names of journals need 
be cited in full only on first occurrence. In all subsequent references to articles from the
same journal, only the initials or known short forms of the journals are to be used.)<br>
(d) Articles in Edited Volumes:<br>
Peter Gaeffke, 'Alexander and the Bengal Sufis', in Alan W.  Entwistle 
and Francoise Mallison, eds, <i>Studies in South Asian Devotional Literature, Research
Papers, 1988-1991</i>, New Delhi/Paris, 1994, pp. 275-84.<br>
<b>On subsequent reference</b> (unless immediately following 
the first reference. in which case
<i>ibid</i>. will be used) the examples at (a), (b) and (c) above will become:<br>
(a) Masters, <i>Origins of Western Economic Dominance</i>, pp 200-201.<br>
(b) Troll, <i>Muslim Shrines in India</i>.<br>

(d) Gaeffke, 'Alexander and the Bengal Sufis'.<br>
(Note: The use of op. cit. and loc. cit. is to be completely avoided.)<br>
B.  PRIMARY  SOURCE citations must include the archival 
location, including the town and, if necessary, the country 
where an archive is located. Each major
series within an archive should have a separate abbreviation. 
In case the material is in a private collection, the name and 
location of the collection should
be mentioned.  If recorded oral materials stored in an audio 
archive are being used the location of the 
recordings should be specified. If not, the name and
location of the oral informant should be clearly stated if possible.<br>
4.   <b><a name="abbr">Abbreviations</a></b> may either 
be listed early in the notes if few in number. Or at first use, e g.
Tamil Nadu State Archives, Madras (hereafter TNSA).<br>
5.  <b><a name="ital">Italics</a></b>: For readability, do not use 
italics too frequently. The test should be whether the
average reader of IESHR is familiar with the word. Thus 'zarmindar' 
need not be italicised.<p>

Write to Sage Publications India Pvt. Ltd., Post Box 4215. New Delhi 110 048 INDIA. for
