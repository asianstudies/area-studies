<b>Music!</b> Geet! Gana! Songs! Three sets of South Asian music in 3
different formats have arrived and will be placed in the <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/MusicLib/index.html"
target="_blank">Music library</a>.  Five CDs of <a
href="music01.html#rajas" target="_blank">Rajasthani folk music</a>,
including one with traditional instruments and one with marriage songs,
play out the variety of those region's melodic traditions.  Four <a
href="music01.html#bengal" target="_blank">Bengali music cassettes</a>
present the songs of that region, including folk and mystical Baul
songs.  And third, there are 2 CDs of <a href="music01.html#film"
target="_blank">Hindi film music</a>; one of them in the VCD format
(Video CD) popular in India and other South Asian countries.  Hear and
see Alisha's "Made in India: on the "Best of Channel Hits" VCD; or hear
Suram Nath play the Murla Been on the "Rajastani Desert Melodies" CD; or
Sukhabilasa Barma sing Bengali folk songs from the "Bhaoyaiya" cassette.
In addition, Ustad <a href="music01.html#khan" target="_blank">Sultan
Khan plays</a> the sarangi in a 1985 concert (music cassette).

<a name="info"></a> <p>The Arts and Sciences libraries are actively involved
in two on-going projects -- one, in defining and promoting <b><a
href="http://staff.lib.virginia.edu/LofT/ic.html"
target="_blank">Information Communities</a></b>, and two, in supporting
the academic departments in promotion of the publication of their
scholarly research in the new electronic environment.  <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/infocom/tibet/ target="_blank"> <img

alt="The Tibetan and Himalyan Digital Library" align=right border=0
width="87" height="72"></a> The <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/infocom/tibet/"
target="_blank">Tibetan and Himalyan Digital Library</a> is a good
example of an Information Community that is already up and running.
Other possible <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/subjects/infocomm/ic.html#info"
target="_blank">InfoComms</a> are American Studies, Poetry,
Architecture, and the Virginia Environment. [<a

<p>Making all <b>scholarly research articles</b> available free for all,
all the time is the eventual goal of the Self-Archiving (<a
href="http://www.eprints.org/" target="_blank">Eprints</a>) and <a
href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">Open Archives</a>
initatives, which have been developing <a
href="http://opcit.eprints.org/explorearchives.shtml"
target="_blank">software and web programs</a> over the last years and
are now fully available.� Scholars can now start adding their
pre-publication and publication articles to electronic archives (the <a
href="http://www.eprints.org/" target="_blank">Eprints</a> program). The
articles will be automatically indexed and made interoperable on the web
(the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/" target="_blank">Open
Archives</a> program).� Two other resources for faculty and
librarians, concerned with reclaiming their scholarly publications, are
called "<a href="http://www.createchange.org/home.html"
target="_blank"><a>Create Change</a></a>" and "<a
href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/DI/" target="_blank">Declarining
Independence</a>". The <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/presentations/FSR/facultysenate.html"
target="_blank">University libraries support</a> these on-going changes
in <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/scholcomm.html"
target="_blank">scholarly communication</a>�among the faculty and
researchers.

<a name="dict"></a>
<p><b><a href="http://www.tibet.dk/pktc/tdiction.htm"
target="_blank">Tibetan-English dictionaries</a> and full-text
titles</b> are being networked so that University of Virginia researches
may log in and accesses these electronic databases.  These include
the Surat Chnadra Das' dictionary and Tony Duff's Illuminator
dictionary; <a name="etex"></a>as well as the texts of Gampopa's 
Jewel Ornament of Liberation, Bodhisatvacaryavatara and Madhyamakavatara
critical editions. And more. Look for them soon in VIRGO.  In
addition <i><b>TibetDoc Tibetan word-processor CD</b></i> for Windows by
Lotsawa Tony Duff is available in my <Nawang's) office if anyone wants
to look at it.
