South Asian researchers will find the new <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://bas.umdl.umich.edu/b/bas/">Bibliography of Asian Studies</a> database a useful tool for finding articles on their topics.
It is like having an electronic version of the 20 printed volumes of the
<b>BAS</b> all rolled into one place and completely searchable.
Presently the database covers more than 400,000 titles mainly from 1971
to 1991, but there are some 1960s materials, and post-1991 titles are
being indexed and added as fast as the BAS staff can make them
available.  If you "<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://bas.umdl.umich.edu/b/bas/jrnls/">Browse by Journal Title</a>," and look at the "Economic and Political Weekly" under "E",
you can see that 3360 articles have been indexed so far for the period
from 1970-1993.  For very current indexing, go to the "Other Data Bases"
in VIRGO, and log into such databases as <a
href="http://tikal.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/webspirs/uva.cgi">WILS</a>
or <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvabin/rlgv-anl.scr">Anthropological
Literature Online</a>. The web site for the BAS is <br> <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://bas.umdl.umich.edu/b/bas/">http://bas.umdl.umich.edu/b/bas/</a>

<a name="news"></a> Some changes are occurring in the University's

the daily (Calcutta) <a
href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/"><b><i>Telegraph</i></b></a>, the
weekly <a href="http://www.india-today.com/index.html"><b><i>India
Today</i></b></a>, and the quarterly <a

border=0 alt="Index to Biblio"></a> During the next year the <a
href="http://www.timesofindia.com/"><b><i>Times of India</i></b></a>
(Delhi) will be substituted for the <b><i>Hindustan Times</i></b> and
the weekly <a
href="http://www.outlookindia.com/"><b><i>Outlook</i></b></a> will be
added to the magazines.  We have already started receiving airmail
issues of <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Biblio/bib.html">
<b><i>BIBLIO</i></b></a>. Look for them in the Alderman 3rd floor
Periodicals Room. As with many titles in this new electronic era,
versions of most of these are available also on the Web. Links to most
of these newspapers and magazines can be clicked on from this web page

<a name="musi"></a> About 50 long-playing <b>Indian music</b> records
were transfered from Alderman storage shelves to the Music Department,
where they will added to the collection.  Even in this older format,
this is a rich collection of recordings dating from the late 1970s to
the early 1980s.  Gradually they will be cataloged in VIRGO.  They
include vocal and instrumental music from such artists as Bade Bhulam
Ali Khan, Bhimsen Joshi, Vilayat Khan (sitar), N. Ramani (flute), and
Amjad Ali Khan (sarod).  Ask about them at Cabell Hall's Music
Department.  If your preference is more for cinema music than classical,
cinema music cassettes are still being added to the <b><i>Indian Cinema
Collection</i></b>.  To see the 21 titles so far, type "Indian cinema
music" into a VIRGO Quick Search box and click on Begins and Title.
These cassettes are in Clemons, such as CAS 1668, <b><i>Romance busters
'97</i></b>. Ask for them at the Clemons Circulation Desk.<p>

The library has started to receive issues of  <b>journals</b>

Monitoring the Indian Economy.  Keep up to date with the issues 
of  <b><i>Monthly review of the Indian economy</i></b>,

(as of October 1998), we have the 
months of June through August 1998.<p>

Oops! Now, lastly, are some <b>real books</b>: a multi-volume set.  The library is planning to 
arrange for the purchase of the full set of 255 volumes of the <b><i>Narthang Tanjur</i></b>.  The 
first 30 volumes have been purchased this year and have been shipped by sea mail 
from Delhi. Check for them in VIRGO in about a month.<p>
