Minutes</a> of the Meeting</b></font><br>
<font size=""><b>March 26, 1998. Washington, DC</b></font></center>

 <hr>   

<b>1. Minutes from the Madison meeting</b> were distributed and
approved.  Sign-up sheet was lost so there is no record of
those present.<p>

<b>2. Report from LC by Lygia Ballantyne</b> <p>
The <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/sabib_d.html"><b><i>
South Asia Bibliographer</i></b></a>, as 
successor to the <b><i>South Asia Accessions
list</i></b>, is being published by Sage.  In addition to basic
bibliographic information, the LCCN is included but profile
numbers are not.<p>

The New Delhi Field Office hopes to have a 
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/">webpage </a>ready by
April.  They welcome suggestions.  It will include a list of
currently <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/sa02_d.html">
filmed materials from Delhi</a>, last issued filmed
etc. and contents of <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/clrgen_d.html">
fiched collections</a>.  The Indian
Publication Project is linked via Chicago.  
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://ets.lib.uchicago.edu/INDIAN-PUB/serials.form.html"> The Serials list</a>
is still at Chicago but it could be hosted at Delhi for live
updates.  The webpage will include a 
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/pcpt_d.html">list of participants</a>
which can link to participant webpages.  Send in those
URL's.<p>

They are working on an office LAN with a direct connection
to LC-DC that doesn't rely on the Indian telephone system. 
They can search MUMS-OCLC etc.<p>

The serials catalogers are being trained via OCLC in CONSER. 
They will need a NUC symbol for Field Office cataloging.<p>

Turning to fiscal matters.  As of January 1998, half the
participants were in the red rupee-wise.  There is no IODA
report but a hybrid report might be possible.<p>

Lygia made a trip to Nepal where she interviewed 12
candidates for the position of LC representative including 4
good ones.  A new rep was selected but appointment is still
in process.<p> 

A number of acquisition trips are underway or planned. 
Sending different staff members to different places to get
different perspectives.  They are looking for Christian
liberation theology materials from the South.  There are
changes in dealerships.  The Tibetan selector was sent to
Nepal and acquired participant copies of Chinese imprints.<p>

In response to questions about the upcoming bills, Lygia
replied that the overhead percentage needs to be figured
before they can prepare them.  Remember this upcoming year
will be full dollar day.  Lygia plans to prepare a core
program to appeal to other libraries.<p>

In response to a question about the rejection rate, she
noted that the rate for English is 30%. But it varies by
language.<p>

The Lok Sabha Secretariat has filmed the Lok Sabha debates. 
LC-Delhi will investigate acquiring French materials from
Pondicherry that are not part of the French Institute. 
Expect trekking maps from Nepal, a language atlas from Sage. 
They need to do an update on the Survey of India maps.<p>

LC-Delhi wants to improve serials claiming procedures and
quickly let participants know current status of questionable
titles.<p>

<b>3. <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/concon.html">
By-laws</a> revision discussion.</b><p>
Should voting be limited to one from each institution.  No,
but it should be secret, via ballots enclosed in separate
envelopes. (A response to e-mail voting).<p>

Should the South Asia Council (SAC) faculty representative
also vote.  No decision?<p>

Should there be voting and non-voting members.  To be a
member of CONSALD, one must be a member of AAS as CONSALD is
a subgroup of AAS.<p>

People can be encouraged to join CONSALD via the AAS
newsletter and the listserv.<p>

<b>4. SALNAQ report from David Nelson</b><p>
What is the purpose of SALNAQ, should it move to 
notes & queries and away from the feature articles. 
Could/would CONSALDers review new reference sources as
they're published, report on projects at individual
institutions, new accessions, review websites, videos, etc. 
If SALNAQ ceases, then prepaid subscriptions will need to be
refunded.<p>

<b>Report from <a href="http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/">CRL</a> 
by Marlys Rudeen.</b><br>
CRL has the 
<a href="http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/info/profiles/profhome.html">
current LC participant profiles</a> as of January
1998 on the CRL webpage. <p>

Milton Wolf is the Vice President for Collections and
Programs.<p>

ICON the International Coalition on Newspapers will meet in
DC on April 8 addressing preservation and access issues.<p>

There will be a new version of the CRL website in April.<p>

CRL wishes to cooperate with the AAS Publications committee
on the Doctoral Dissertations on Asia project.<p>

<b>6. CONSALD taskforce on electronic products.</b><p>
Jim Nye discussed the Crea Tamil dictionary and the Oxford
Hindi dictionary.  Members should identify other products of
interest.<p>

<b>7. <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://bas.umdl.umich.edu/b/bas/help/about-short.html"> BAS on line </a>project.</b><p>
David Magier brought us up to date on this project.  It is
being demonstrated in the exhibit area.  The CD-ROM product
has been abandoned for the time being and it has moved to
the web.  Covers 1971-1997.  There are 462,000 records with
South Asia heavily represented because of the additional
indexing some institutions paid for.  They welcome
enhancement suggestions.  Could add e-journals and e-
conferences, etc. with links to JSTOR and other full text
sources.  Bindu Bhatt did the indexing at Columbia, she is
now the Area Studies Library Specialist at Colombia.<p>
<b>

8. Title VI funding.</b><p>
The status is fragile.  ARL is lobbying.  Title VI is being
considered for consolidation with Title XI in the House
committee and approved 36 to 3.<p>

<b>9. Berkeley 
<a href="http://library.berkeley.edu/SSEAL/SouthAsia/Unicode.html">
Unicode</a> project.</b><p>

Panjabi and Urdu language publications.<p>

<b>10. ARL <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/LibInfo/Subjects/SouthAsia/dsal.html"> Digital South Asia Library</a> Project.</b>
Index periodical contents at URC in roman format now (but
Unicode later) and provide scanned full text via e-mail.<p>

The text of the project proposal is available on the Chicago
website.<p>

Lygia mentioned that ARL has invited the LC Field Directors
to meet before ALA to discuss how to improve the collection
of materials.  Solicit suggestions on how to improve digital
collection to serve the scholarly community.  The LC field
offices could contribute indexing of earlier journals and
vernacular materials.<p>

<b>11. The British Library's official publications from India</b>
at the University of Chicago cannot be loaned via ILL. 
There are 22,500 volumes of official publications which is a
duplicate of the India Office collection.  A webpage is

<b>12. Booklab Reference tools update</b><p>
