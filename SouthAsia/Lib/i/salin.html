<P>South Asia is one of the prominent sub-continents that have attracted
world wide popularity. It consists of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. People in South Asia speak
hundreds of languages, follow different religions, and have diverse
costumes and foods. Because of its ancient history, civilization,
variety of cultures and complex society, academicians from all over the
globe are becoming more involved in teaching and research on various
aspects of South Asia.  Most recently, a number of universities in
United States and Canada have experienced a tremendous increase in the
enrollments by undergraduate as well as graduate students of South Asian
ancestry that are taking courses dealing with their own heritage and
traditions. To support teaching and research in the academic
institutions, libraries have developed good collections of printed and
microforms resources. In recent years there has been a huge
proliferation of electronic and web resources on South Asia, and info

<P>A number of online databases have been developed on South Asia, but
most of these are in the area of science and technology. There is utmost
need for more online resources in the areas of social sciences,
humanities and arts. Efforts should be made to produce some qualitative
web sites in various South Asian languages. In view of the vast scope of
the South Asian countries, and development of online resources, this
paper attempts only a sampling of useful Internet resources and
networks.</P>
