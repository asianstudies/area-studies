<b>3. LC -Report (James Gentner)</b><br>
Acquisition. Director has reorganized Overseas Operations. . OvOp has ceased to exist,
and is now "African/Asian Acquisitions &amp; Overseas Operations". (Rio office is included de
facto). Excluded are Slavic, Europe, Latin America (except Rio). All phones, addresses,
etc. remain the same. Judy McDermott is still chief.<p>

This year, passage of legislative bill for the revolving fund authorization (and the
congressional reauthorization) was passed. Thanks to all who wrote their representatives
and senators. Don't forget that Thank you follow-up letters are always welcome.<p>

USIF funds are used up this FY. Could we pay for Indian materials 
in rupees if rupees
*could be generated from Indian donors, etc.? Yes, it will be possible to do this, for
purchasing of materials and binding but not for overhead/shipping/etc. charges,.which
must be paid in US dollars. This method would be time consuming for LC and a
substantial amount of money. is needed to make it worthwhile. It would be easier if the
entire materials bill could be covered. Advance notification to LC would be needed.<p>

LC did well with its operating budget for the year ($14.7 Million 4.4% increase over last
year).<p>

MIPP continues. NEH grant $ expended, but Government of India rupee matching fund
has been garnered. Microfilming in Bombay this year, then begin in Hyderabad for Urdu
and Telugu materials.<p>

Sage publications might start publishing AccListSouthAsia, as early of January 1998.<p>

There are four new LC program participants.<p>

LC-Delhi received permission to distribute Mapin books (even though co-published by
Granada in US).<p>

Delhi staff cataloged 15,986 titles this year.<p>

If there is any interest, reprints can be provided by circular letters only.<p>

Could LC mount a version of the accessions list on a web site? Not yet, but soon. Also
they might agree to house and maintain the serials lists (back from Chicago), and the
profile data (incl. rankings, back from CRL). Additional information products for web
dissemination? Microfiche lists? (But note: if Delhi puts fiche items on their web, that
doesn't mean that PhotoDup would be able to supply right away. It could be years ... ).
New head of PhotoDup is Kevin Flood. Newsletter from field office. Annual reports.<p>

The lift vans are being unpacked more quickly at LC due to security concerns.<p>

State Dept. has started charging on a new basis to other "client" agencies. Impact on
overhead charge not known yet. But a rise in the overhead charge could be seen by
FY2000.<p>

At AAS in March 1998 in DC, The Asian Division will offer tours and a presentation on
March 27, 2-4:30.<p>
