Subject: <b>Minutes -- LC Cooperative Acquisitions Program Meeting, 28 June</b><p>

<hr>

<b>Attending</b> for LC:  Judy McDermott, James Gentner, Fred Protopappas, Field
Directors for India, Pakistan, Cairo, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro<p>

Susan Rabe announced that Marlys Rudeen would return to work at CRL the
week of 29 June.<p>

On behalf of Will, Fred reported that Will was returning to Jakarta.  The
cost of materials will be a problem due to exchange rate volatility.  The
Web page for Jakarta is under review by LC's oversight comm.  Will is
concentrating on acquisitions from Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam for LC.  Jim
Armstrong mentioned a recent interview with an Indonesian publisher in
Granta.<p>

<b><a name="indi">INDIA</a></b>:  Lygia noted the existing economic 
sanctions by the US following the
nuclear tests.  LC does not anticipate that these will affect their
acquisitions routines.  They will certainly try to obtain timely
information on policy formulation in this area.  India and Pakistan are
cooperating on a project to collate news reports and reaction in English
and the regional languages within the 2 nations for a specific time
interval; these will be fiched as a set.<p>

Acquisitions is now fully staffed.  The part-time Malayalam staffer has
joined Acq. full time; background in both literature and political science.
A new rep in Nepal has been hired.  Acquisitions for Nepal were down 500
items in the interim between reps.  A new person to cover scientific topics
has been added.<p>

With improved telecommunications, the New Delhi staff can use Internet to
search the LC catalog and other tools.  This minimizes duplication and
unnecessary purchases in the reprint area.  They are cataloging serials
directly into OCLC.<p>

India's Web page is also under review by LC's oversight comm.<p>

The new South Asian Bibliographer, successor to ALSA, is available from
Sage.  Ross Atkinson (Cornell) asked whether they were deriving any
financial benefit from supplying the data; answer is no.  Lygia noted that
Sage was selected because they have a solid reputation in serials and
because they have no direct relationship with the Field Office.  Given the
price quoted in letters to many participants, I asked who was subscribing.
Lygia said she was aware of several Canadian and Australian libraries using
SAB to identify purchases.<p>

Since LC has been asked by Indian publishers to pre-assign LC card numbers,
there might be a possibility of using the Web to provide pre-pub
information for some titles.<p>

Lygia noted that circulars for reprints, expensive titles, and ambiguous
materials were now routinely sent by e-mail.<p>

<b><a name="paki">PAKISTAN</a></b>:  Jim said everyone in 
Pakistan knew there would be a reply to the
nuclear explosions in India.  Economic sanctions have hit them severely,
including publishers.  Initially books may be cheaper, but production costs
will surely increase unit costs over time.<p>

They are continuing to acquire Afghani and Iranian materials through
Islamabad.  The Iranian dealer is in Dubai.  He will initiate some Central
Asian acquisitions.<p>

They too have improved telecommunications with LC.  Catalog copy is sent
electronically.  Internet access is lagging however.p

Web page under development.<p>

One of Jim's most serious concerns is the need for a a wage review for all
Embassy employees; LC is included.<p>

<b><a name="cair">CAIRO</a></b>:  They are relatively calm politically.  Since her arrival in Sept.,
learning operations the highest priority for LM.  The new US Ambassador is
interested in LC's activities.  They are working with vendors with low
performance: nothing from Iraq, negative response to requests for Algerian
newspapers and serials.  A new focus on Sudan.  She's trying to routinize
serials receipts and claiming and wants to notify participants of LC's
exchange titles.  Hope to expand to music and maps, perhaps other media.
They hope to offer European titles to participants if available in the
local market.<p>

They plan to get local microfilming in place.  After relocation to a
different area of the Embassy (by May 99), infrastructure can be
established.<p>

Should finish processing several backlogs by Sept/Oct.<p>

[Frank Shulman asked a question about acquisition of popular culture by the
Field Offices.  There is no standard response.  Cairo queries participants
on a title-by-title basis.  For India, less scholarly materials likely to
be fiched.  Pakistan is more "austere;" some footpath literature in
regional languages.  There was no immediate consensus in the audience about
levels of interest.]<p>

<a name="nair"><b>NAIROBI</b></a>:  Ruth noted problems 
with electricity rather than political
instability the norm.  They relocated last July to a residential area with
less pollution and congestion.  Acquisitions are fairly constant.  She is
working on a 2 year project to acquire West African materials for LC.  They
are working to preserve newspapers; while not currently filming, material
being collected and collated in Nairobi.  On an acquisitions trip to
Rwanda, she was able to complete their run of gazettes with a visit to the
Prime Minister's Office.<p>

Hope to extend participant program to Mauritius and Malawi.<p>

Continuing to issue bi-monthly Accessions List and quarterly index of
literature.  The entire 9 volumes will be available on the Web at
http://www.icipe.org/locnairobi/  [Not there when I checked link today]
Several CD-ROMs being distributed through GPO.<p>

<b><a name="riod">RIO DE JANEIRO</a></b>:  Big news the World Cup not politics.

She visited Surinam, French Guiana, and Guyana to acquire materials.  Given
level of publishing, one trip every 3 years should be OK.  Field Office now
has LAN and is increasing e-mail communication with participants.  Annual
Report for the office was announced on listservs for Brazil and SALALM
leading to requests for copies.  Brazil popular groups (1997) now
available.  The office has covered 30 years so far and hope to get an index
on the Web.  Acquisitions strong, no backlog for cataloging, approx. 1/3
material by exchange.  Have discovered bibliographic and music CDs in local
market at half the retail price in US/Europe; hope to offer these to
participants at $8-10 per title.  Field Office will co-host IFLA reception
for Wedgeworth, and Dr. Billington to visit.<p>

<a name="gene">James Gentner</a> noted that <b>authority records</b> 
created in New Delhi for name
and series being loaded in OCLC; should include all monographs and serials
soon.  For Cairo script will be included once modems in both DC and Cairo
are working.<p>

Frank Shulman asked about <b>unpublished dissertations</b>.  Could LC acquire
these for CRL as part of foreign dissertation coverage?  Susan said such a
request would need to be vetted by the Collections and Services Advisory
Panel because there would be budget issues involved.  Ruth noted that a
feasibility study for African theses/dissertations was already in place.<p>

Judy distributed copies of the results of brainstorming done at LC prior to
the <b>ARL Global Resources</b> meeting on the 24th.  It was my understanding that
she and OvOp/FO staff planned to refine the list and devise a strategy for
working with the various area studies library comm. rather than float the
list we received; however, Robin didn't hear the same thing.  At any rate,
most interest focused on journal indexing and preservation activiities.
Funding is critical to implementation, although this list reflects the
initial thoughts of the Field Directors.  Ross noted that Judy had proposed
at the ARL session closer links to scholarly groups and societies for
area/international studies; she reiterated her wish that the Field Offices
been seen as more than vendors.  I suggested they consider approaching the
Council of American Overseas Research Centers (CAORC).  LM plans to visit
the Center in Cairo, and they have an admin. office in DC.<p>

<a name="bill"><b>Bills</b></a> for next FY should 
be in the mail by the time you receive this.
Overhead rates are as follows:<p>

Brazil:  59%<br>
Egypt:  42%<br>
India/Indonesia:  18%<br>
Kenya:  64%<br>
Pakistan:  48%<p>

Cost recovery being reviewed by outside auditor yet again.<p>

Judy emphasized that all Web pages must meet LC editorial standards and
that those prepared for ALA activities had moved up in the review process,
but OvOp will have theirs up as soon as possible.<p>

With nearly all the Field Directors attending, Ross took the opportunity to
express appreciation for all participating libraries for LC's efforts in
support of international studies.<p>
