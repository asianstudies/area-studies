<p><strong><a name="prel">I. Preliminaries.</a></strong>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1. Announcement</strong>: 
AIIS Reception at 5 pm today, Salon F 3/4th Floor.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2. Minutes Approval.</strong>  
Of 26<sup>th</sup> March 1998 in Washington, DC.<strong>  -</strong> Approved.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3. </strong>SAC meeting 
agreed to pay for coffee.   Mary Drake, Backup, 
From Prichard.<strong></strong>

<p><strong><a name="delh">II. Library of Congress Reports</a></strong>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;New Delhi - Lygia Ballantyne</strong>

<p><strong>Acquisitions. </strong>New Delhi office is staffed now; more travel is paying off.  Sir Lanka declining
receipts, but hired new dealer in Columbo.  Mongolia - one good trip; another planned for June;
lots of publications, even in English;  14 in that program presently. Assam and North-East new
dealer. Nepal, after 2 years, now have some.  Aligarh and Kashmir selector will see how much is
there and how much we can get.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result of good efforts - 
more receipts. Before selection used to be 37% increases; now
25% increases, and have to be even more selective.   Look at budget, combined obligations,
which is annualized every month; allows to give participants pre-warnings; such as already sent
out about shipping - the slight increase in the U.S., meant a 25% overall increase. Review of
shipping showed we are using the cheapest lift vans.  Also made a comparison with other book
vendors and their prices - the full survey is available on request.

<br><strong>*Cataloging</strong> - not much to 
report; paying lots of attention to S.E. Asia.  Covering Mongolia and
Thailand pretty well.

<br><strong>*Serials.</strong>  Did a lot this year, 
improved serials delivery.  Local supervisors have emails and are
responsible for their own areas; getting about 40 emails a day, spread among supervisors of
departments; sending out serials updates by email.  Exploring putting it up on the web with a
search engine.  Can supply individualized reports - tailored to your format (text, WordPerfect,
FoxPro).

<br><strong>*Web Page</strong> - just sent 35 pages to be updated to Washington, for their review.

<br><strong>*Audits</strong> - past years limited ones done by LC; this year a full review took lots of time.

<br><strong>*Department of State tri-year Inspection </strong>to be regularized, such as paying language
consultants; part of legislation on the Revolving Fund, and the Financial Statement.

<br><strong>*Staff -</strong> Alice Knisner is returning this year - welcome input for sendoff set for late May. 
Farewell messages.  If anyone is in Delhi. come to celebration.  Ballantyne moving to another
house/location.

<br><strong>*LC celebrating 200 years</strong> next year, and Delhi also wants to celebrate; welcome ideas - such as
recording important South Asia writers; Thrasher - a button; Nye a traveling exhibit around
South Asia, maybe with rare books.

<br><strong>*Questions and comments</strong> - Nye - 
would be good if Pakistan could send to Serials Database at
the same time India.  Magier - cataloging mistakes, depending on category, who to send to; also
send to Delhi for their information.

<p><strong><a name="paki">Pakistan -- Judy McDermott</a></strong>

<br>*Ordered departure, but returned Jan. 20<sup>th</sup>.  Situation remains quiet.

<br>*Gives detailed statistical report with total figures.

<br>*Publication section flourishing, though Afghanistan publications have not recovered. Iranian
doing well.

<br>*Jan.-Feb. confrontation between two groups, lasting several weeks; eventually resolved and
resumed publication. 

<p><strong>Discussion of LC offices activities</strong>.  Raised some 
binding questions, especially with Iran serials vendor;
also missing issues, spine information not correct; should inform offices of binding problems.
**(Mitchell) Keep serials updates going, good. **Will trips to Kashmir/Mongolia look at
everything? Ballantyne - yes.

<p><strong>Update on MIPP</strong>. With change of government, 
money not available; doing a little from other
sources (CRL, SAMP, and LC). Currently under review - 2 cameras working in Hyderabad on
Urdu.  McDermott - Looking at how it could be continued, as LC project? - don't know as yet.

<p><strong><a name="work">III. Report on LC 
Cataloging Workshop&#173;Alan Grosenheider</a></strong>

<br>Held at Harvard this year: smaller, breakout sessions were longer; suggestions for next year
include electronic cataloging.

<p>List of SA catalogers in the US (Mary Rader).  


<p><strong><a name="byel">IV. Bylaws Revisited</a></strong>

<br>*Various provisions reviewed and discussed; 
to be reviewed again in Madison, and changed at
next year's AAS meeting. Changes - from 3-year terms to 2-year terms, agreed.  Change from 2
to 3 ex-officio members of 1) Newsletter editor, 2) LC representative, add 3) CRL representative;
Approved.

<p>Announcement by Nye - wish to commemorate landmarks, such as CONSALD's 30<sup>th</sup>
anniversary; will wait for Maureen Patterson.


<p align="center"><strong>BREAK</strong>


<p><strong><a name="saln">V. SALNAQ Online</a></strong>&#173;
David Nelson and Philip McEldowney.  David Nelson reporting.

<br>*Considering the suggestion to migrate from a paper to an electronic Newsletter.  Discusses and
raises questions of design, content, take advantage of already existing publication, for publication
about South Asia Resources, information on databases; central location for SAMP and
CONSALD minutes.  What should be represented in each publication?  6 or 7 topics rather than
list of short items.  Want it to be cooperative, send in contributions; always dynamic.  Include
News &amp; Notes.  Own web site, linked from other sites.

<br>*Further discussion of SALNAQ scope and purpose - if clearing house, duplicates SARAI? Just
Notes and Queries? A Listserv? Mainly reviews and evaluations? Used outside U.S?

<br>*General opinion - would like something to continue.

<p>Maureen Patterson - I founded SALNAQ. This is 30<sup>th</sup> CONSALD anniversary; 25th anniversary
of SALNAQ - at the beginning it was a review of important reference works, dictionaries; just
what everyone wanted - both general and specific.  Came out of the 1974 Boston Conference, not
from Library of Congress. 

<p>Magier - a current awareness tool; Burlingham - if goes back to S.A. people - do they want it
printed out and emailed? Nye - value by editing; stake out what you want and do it.  McMahon -
do a mission statement.  Joshi - send in contributions by xx date.  Mitchell - I do a bulletin with a
theme each time - next is on images.  McMahon - let us know.

<p><strong><a name="mpat">VI. Acknowledgment and Appreciation 
of the services of Maureen Patterson.</a></strong>  Speeches and
applause.
