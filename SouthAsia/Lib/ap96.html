Subject: CONSALD minutes, Wednesday 10 April 1996<p>

David indicated there would be a <b>moratorium</b> for one year on membership in
the executive board.  Members continuing are:  Aggarwal, Joshi, Khera, and
Magier.<p>

Lygia reported on <b>LC/OvOp matters</b>:<ol>
 <li><b>Good news</b>.  We will have rupees until 1998 at least and maybe into
      1999.  If funds are blocked we will ask for 32,000,000 rupees which
      will carry us for 2 years.  If the funds are not blocked they will
      probably last another year.<br>
 <li>The <b>move</b> in New Delhi is complete.  The facility has less storage
      space.  There are two new cameras and filming is moving from the
      embassy to the new office.<br>
  <li>In February there was a mini conference on subject profiles when
      several American librarians visited.  <b>Standardized</b> categories have
      been introduced, especially for Pakistan.  The lists of these new
      categories will be distributed by e-mail.<br>
      Starting on 23 February  the subject profile will be encoded with
      the new profile categories.  LC does assign more than one category
      for a book to insure widest distribution possible.<br>
  <li>Five <b>catalogers</b> were fired and 1 is immigrating to the United States
      and another went to Canada.  Cataloging in Gujarati, Khmer, Malayalam,
      Punjabi, Tamil, and Thai has been reduced because of these recent
      actions.  Presently there are no significant backlogs but new staff
      will need to be trained.<br>
 <li>David requested periodic statements on the size of <b>arrearages</b>.  Lygia
      indicated 914 books were returned to New Delhi from Washington.  There
      are about 1,400 works acquired more than one year ago awaiting
      cataloging.  There are only 21 serials awaiting cataloging.<br>
<li>Lygia mentioned the ongoing <b>comparisons</b> of program acquisitions and
      dealer lists.  Recently they compared Navrang and DK.  She also did
      a "Jerry Barrier" list and the program had 95% of them.  Of the 29
      titles not found, 10 were government documents and 19 were commercial
      titles.  DK has impressive lists but usually they acquire only one copy
      so if one doesn't get that copy you may not get the desired title.
      Don expressed great appreciation for Alice's recent work with listing
      OUP titles which will and which won't be acquired.<br>
 <li>A cooperative <b>Burma program</b> is to be launched this year.  Details will
      be communicated to CORMOSEA.<br>
  <li>The <b>serials list </b>is now out on diskette.<br>
  <li>Lygia indicated that 1997 is the <b>50th anniversary</b> of India's
      independence and solicited ideas on how this might be celebrated.<br>
 <li>The US budget is being felt in the field.  <b>Accessions list </b>may go.
      Only New Delhi and Nairobi still have accessions lists.  It will be
      going from quarterly to bi-monthly.  It costs about $25,000 a year
      to produce.
</ol>

Merry spoke about the <b>field trips to New Delhi</b>.  In February Narindar, Merry,
Irene, Suzanne, David Nelson, and Lynette were in New Delhi for the book
fair.  Quite a few dealers and their agents or representatives spoke to the
group especially individually.  Staff of the New Delhi office went to the
book fair with computers and over 900 items were searched of which 200 were
selected for the programs.  The American librarians participated in the
screening and selection.<p>

<b>Regional consortia</b>.<ol>
 <li><b><a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/subject/area/sacwest/index.html">
SACWest</a></b> met this morning and will meet again tomorrow.  They are fine
      tuning their profile.  They are discussing cooperative purchases.
      Their home page has been mounted at Texas.  Web content is being
      discussed presently.  Combined profiles are available, thanks to
      Monica.<br>
 <li><b><a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/saceast.html">
SACEast</a>.</b>  Includes Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, NYPL, Pennsylvania,
      and Syracuse.  The Library of Congress and Virginia are observers.
      SACEast is several steps behind SACWest.  A database on the New Delhi
      profile has been created for each participant.  There is a 1-2-3 step
      evaluation for each categlory.  There will be many 3s, works for which
      there will not be coverage.  There will be a goodly number of safe 2s
      and a medium list of endangered 2s.  Collection sharing has not been
      discussed.<br>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/saccic.html">
CIC</a></b>.  There has been a call for proposals for projects for digital
      libraries and one was made for South and Southeast Asia.  There is also
      a proposal for preservation photocopying of reference materials.
      Michigan and Minnesota continue to work jointly.  Madison will be
      hiring a replacement for Jack Wells over the summer.  There is
      interest for full text of dictionaries.<br>
<li>There was a meeting in Madison of the <b>South Asia working group</b> for
      information and consortia relations.  Areas to be looked at include:
      newspapers, profiles, a rview of the CRL serials, "esoteric" language
      holdings, and endangered monographs.  In a meeting in June there will
      be a second tier of serial cancellations, looking at the newspaper list,
      and profile issues.<br>
  <li><b>Triangle consortium</b>.  Has three libraries:  Duke, NC State, and UNC.
      There are several areas of cooperation:  East Asia, Eastern Europe,
      Latin America, and South Asia.  They are trying to avoid duplication
      in acquisitions.  There is a good delivery system between the three
      universities.  Tony Stewart is working on distance education programs.<p>
</ol>

Jim spoke on his draft proposal for the <b>Collection Development Fund for
India</b>.  This is not the same as the U.S. India Fund.  Many issues and
questions arose regarding the concepts expressed in the draft:<ul>
 <li>Should we have 30 copies in the United States of English titles.  If we
    elect to get less copies, how will this reduce effectiveness and
    discounts of the New Delhi Office?  Lygia indicated dollars can always
    be used when the rupees run out.  Volume business has been important.
    Once the rupees run out the LC office will remain but buying for LC
    as well as for others who are willing to pay dollars.
    It may be more important to get 30 copies of books which will be used
    instead of 1 in a language which won't be consulted.<br>
  <li>Should there be a national consortia instead of the regional ones?<br>
  <li>Is there potential ARL involvement in all this?<br>
 <li>The lottery proposal will probably not work even when we are on dollars.<br>
  <li>LC doesn't feel it should have every copy of every book.  If someone
    else has it that is fine.<br>
 <li>Ved suggested we set a date for ending the ruppes which will force us
    to make decisions.<br>
  <li>There will be core items we all want.  There will be items clearly no one
    wants.  The problem are those titles which are inbetween.</ul>

Mention was made of the <b>Urdu consortium proposal</b>.  Jim is hosting a meeting
Saturday morning.  Merry, Don, Ved, Krishan, Ray, Suzanne, David Magier,
and David Nelson will attend.<p>

Irene mentioned the Australians are working on an <b>inventory of microform
holdings in Australia</b>, which are held in offices and out of bibliographic
control.  England has comparable groups.  We need to share information with
these groups.<p>

The meeting will continue Thursday.<p>
