James Gentner demonstrated LC's new web page from the New Delhi office
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/">http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/</a> 
and  noted that websites from the
other overseas offices are under construction.  James stated that serials
(but not monographs) autority work in New Delhi is done on OCLC and that
there are new OCLC identification codes for the LC overseas offices. He
reported that LC's acqusitions staff acquired 1500 Mongolian items for
participants.  LC is trying to establish an exchange agreement with the
Mongolian State Government.<p>

James reported that the last of the Indian rupees were expended in
September. He said that selection of many circularized titles by
participants might lead to LC having to send supplementary bills. He noted
that the New Delhi office cataloged 15,697 items and created 8,688
authority records.<p>  

In the matter of microfiched title, James noted that the New Delhi office
makes master negatives, which it sends to Washington, so copies ordered
from LC Photodup should be delivered sooner than in the past.  A number of
attendees expressed their doubts that such would happen.<p>

Over the past year, James reported, over 197,000 pieces were distributed
to program participants from the South Asia field offices, and five issues
of the South Asian Bibliographer, formerly the LC Accessions List-South
Asia, were produced. James was asked to provide program participants with
information on the anticipated inflation rate as it affects participants'
acquistion costs.  There was some discussion of participant profiles and
advanced mailing of the list of materials sent.  A suggestion was made
that the lists for both the New Delhi and Islamabad boxes be sent in
advance and included as packing lists for each box.<p>

The evening session, from 7-9, openend with a slide presentation by the
Allchins that focused on The Ancient India & Iran Trust, an almagamation
of several private British book collections on philology, art and
architecture, and archaeology.  The collection of the Trust is open to the
public and is supplemented by lectures and a publications program.  The
Allchins detailed the need for additional funding and outlined steps being
taken to expand and preserve the collection.  More information is
available at the Trusts webssite: <a href="http://members.aol.com/indiran/">

During the CRL report, Marlys distributed a handout on cataloging
statistics.  She noted that CRL is receiving films from the MIPP
undertaking.  She said that the reel guide for the Punjabi Printed Books
program is being loaded onto both RLIN and OCLC.  Marlys reported that the
serial Kaiser-i-Hindis being collected for filming, and that participant
program pages are up on the CRL website.  She stated that the Pakistan
serials list is being reviewed to identify ceased titles and to determine
the number of participants subscribing, with a view to cancelling CRL's
subscription to some titles.  The list of proposed cancellations will be
circulated before any action is taken by CRL.  She also reported that
CRL's collection of foreign documents is being cataloged.<p>

Jim Armstrong is still in Washington following the evacuation of U.S.
government personnel from Pakistan.  He reported that the Islamabad field
office is providing wider geographic coverage than before, with more
materials being acquired from Central Asia.  Afghani acquisitions are up,
particularly restrospective acquisitions; some 5000 older serials and 137
monographs have been acquired. Jim said that publishing in Pakistan is
stable, with a slight increase in recent months.
There has been no increase in censorship, probably because publishers are
self-censoring.  Office staff made seventeen acquisition trips.  The
Islamabad office's website is under construction and should be released
soon. Jim informed participants that future circular letters will be sent
by email.<p>

Announcements: Ved Kayastha reported that Cornell's South Asia video
collection is now available on interlibrary loan.<p>

CONSALD acknowledges the many contributions made to South Asian studies,
South Asian librarianship, and to CONSALD itself by our colleague Om
Sharma, who passed away recently.  Om retired as South Asia librarian at
the University of Michigan.  CONSALD offers condonlences to Om's family.<p>
