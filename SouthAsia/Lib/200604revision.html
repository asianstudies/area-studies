<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Proposals for revision of the CONSALD <A
HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/concon.html">constitution</A>,
April 2006</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>Background</B>:  For a variety of reasons (e.g., other library
responsibilities, lack of travel funds, limitations on outside projects,
participation/membership in other AAS-related agencies which meet at the
same time, and, non-replacement upon retirement/departure), the number
of librarians able or willing to accept appointment to the CONSALD
Executive Board has diminished.  The number of ex-officio members of the
Executive Board (LC representative, CRL representative, SALNAQ/web
editor, immediate past chair) results in a board of eight members or
almost one quarter of the membership of CONSALD.  These members joined
by the SAMP executive board have resulted in a setting in which almost
half our membership has some executive position.  Most people feel they
should have a break of a few years after serving on one of the two
boards.</P>

<P>To address this problem we propose the following changes to the
CONSALD Constitution, namely "Article Four:  Officers and Executive
Board" and "Article Five:  Elections and Appointments."  </P>

<P><B>1.  Article IV.  </B></P>

<P>An Executive Board of the Committee shall consist of three librarians
elected by the membership-at-large and two faculty members appointed by
the South Asia Council.
  The Executive Board shall manage the activities of the CONSALD.</P>

<P>Officers of the Committee shall consist of a Chairperson and a
Secretary.  The Chairperson shall submit an annual report to the
Association for Asian Studies, shall call meetings, and normally preside
at meetings.  The Secretary shall record minutes of meetings and assist
in preparing agendas, announcements, and other records.  The outgoing
chair will serve in an ex-officio capacity and shall assist the current
officers in their work.</P>

<P>The Executive Board itself will determine the Chairperson and
Secretary; because of the rotating nature of the Board, these
appointments will be for one-year terms only, with possibility of
renewal.</P>

<P><B>2. Article V.</B></P>

<P>One librarian shall be normally elected at each annual election for a
three-year term.  (If an outgoing Executive Board member was chair in
their third year, they would serve a fourth year as ex-officio.)  Two
faculty members shall be appointed by the South Asia Council for
two-year staggered terms.  If any vacancy shall occur, a special
election, or appointment in the case of a faculty member, shall be held
to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term.  At the end their three year
appointment, librarian members are eligible to stand for
re-election.</P>
