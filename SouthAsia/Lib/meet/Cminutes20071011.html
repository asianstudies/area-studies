          **<strong>Mary Rader</strong> (Wisconsin):&nbsp; The legal  studies program is growing (2 pre-conferences: Law in India, and Law in Hinduism), and mass deacidification of  Telugu materials is proceeding.<br />
          **<strong>Deepa Banerjee </strong>(Washington): The South Asia Oral History project&rsquo;s second phase  was named in honor of Irene Joshi. Washington has three new hires and two new positions. Deepa will  be presenting a talk at ALA 2008 on scholarly communication and open access in South Asia, and would appreciate input.<br />

        <p> <a href=#top><img align=right alt="Back to the top" src="../im/top20.gif" border=0 height=20 width=39></a> <a name="refresh" id="refresh"></a> <b>CONSALD Structure and Update</b> Tim reported that the CONSALD constitutional changes  (Articles 3 and 5), which align membership and elections with AAS practice, &nbsp;will mean that our next nominating committee  will look for people willing to stand for a three year term so that staggered  appointments will result.<br />
          **Thanks to Merry Burlingham of the University of Texas  (Austin), who has managed the CONSALD e-mail list for many  years. The list will move to the University of Wisconsin, under Mary Rader. (NEW ADDRESS: <a href="mailto:Consald-l@library.wisc.edu">Consald-l@library.wisc.edu</a>)</p>
         
        <p> <a href=#top><img align=right alt="Back to the top" src="../im/top20.gif" border=0 height=20 width=39></a> <a name="website" id="website"></a> <b>CONSALD Web site:</b> Tim prefaced the discussion by thanking Philip  McEldowney, who has served as webmaster for many years &ndash; since early days when  the site evolved from SALNAQ (South Asia Library Notes &amp; Queries)  endeavors. <br />
          **New CONSALD members have brought to the fore a desire  to increase visibility and add more content to the site. <br />
          **Tim directed participants to the Web site proposal  from James Simon (27th September 2007), which is included on the meeting agenda at :<br />
          <a href="200710agenda.html">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/200710agenda.html</a><br />
          **Tim then asked  Bronwen Bledsoe to lead the discussion. <br />
          **Ideas from discussion: <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection development sources might be enlarged.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New three part  design with news at the right, fixed information at left?<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are audience  members? Librarians? Users? Do we need a restricted area for SACAP  participants?&nbsp; Is it a recruitment tool?  For 
          AAS members? A SALNAQ tool for academics?)<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would using  Wikipedia work? Would a WIKI work?&nbsp; (More  people would be able to find our site&hellip;) Probably too vulnerable as Wikipedia  entry&hellip;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we follow  others and get AAS money for our own domain name?<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the site  be broader?<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Rader  volunteers to do the archive.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question: Should  CONSALD begin raising money, having members pay dues so that we will have  resources?<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip thinks a WIKI a good idea with a change from  the Virginia URL to a CONSALD one. (He would work with 2 or 3 people and report  at our next meeting.) <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers, who will work with Philip, are Carol  Mitchell, David Nelson, and Sunita Vaze.</p>
         
        <p> <a href=#top><img align=right alt="Back to the top" src="../im/top20.gif" border=0 height=20 width=39></a> <a name="dsal" id="dsal"></a> <b>DSAL, DDSA, &nbsp;SAUC Reports</b>. <br />
          ** Jerry Hall reported that the immense <i>Linguistic Survey of India</i> <b>Digital South Asia Library (DSAL)</b> project, which uses AJAX technology, will be available in April. It is  envisioned as a three part project including audio and transcription, full text  volumes, and maps from the <i>Linguistic  Survey </i>and about it. &nbsp;(There are 262  phonographic transcriptions.) The 11th Five year plan includes money  for a new survey, so DSAL may have new data to add to the old.<br />
          ** Jim Nye reported that in the <b>Digital Dictionaries of  South Asia (DDSA)</b> portion of DSAL,  agreements have been signed for Hindi, Bangla, and Oriya dictionaries. The South Asia Language Resources Center wants to make a Sindhi dictionary available. Courtesy  of Tokyo University, a Telugu dictionary will be available in the spring.  Perso-Arabic script has been added to 5 dictionaries.&nbsp; In response to a question about clean-up, &nbsp;Jim replied that corrections are encouraged. <br />
          ** The <b>South Asia Union Catalog (SAUC)</b> has improved its  search technology, and will be totally compliant open source by the end of  October. Limited UNICODE search and regional language display is present.&nbsp; It will be able to take in and output MARC  records, and NACO independent status is coming to the cataloger. There will be  a proto name authority file, and emphasis is on the historical database.&nbsp; Questions about how to index the entries and  get GOOGLE to crawl through are being considered.</p>
         
        <p>Frank Conlon, the managing editor of the <i>Bibliography of Asian Studies</i>, joined  the group and was introduced by Tim.</p>
         
        <p> <a href=#top><img align=right alt="Back to the top" src="../im/top20.gif" border=0 height=20 width=39></a> <a name="coop" id="coop"></a> <b>Cooperative Collections</b> Mary Rader reported that the working group of James  Simon, David Magier, Bronwen Bledsoe, David Nelson, and herself has been compiling  data and working to formulate suggestions and strategies for cooperation since  our last meeting.&nbsp; For documents and data  see: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.library.wisc.edu/guides/SoAsia/cooperation.htm">http://www.library.wisc.edu/guides/SoAsia/cooperation.htm</a> <br />
          **The web site includes a comparison of SACAP profiles  from 2005-2006 as well as a summary report of the survey conducted last spring,  which was viewed by 40 people, with 23 responses. Mary reviewed the survey  document, and answered questions and led discussion about cooperation. (Sam  Wright assisted with the survey.) She expects the working group, which is open  to new collaborators, to work at determining what to do and who would like to  do it. Figuring out how will follow. The group expects to present new  directions at the CONSALD meeting at AAS in Atlanta. <br />
          **The group was enthusiastic in discussing cooperative  collecting, and asked about how best to grapple with what we are trying to  support overall. Suggestions included determining whether members feel  comfortable uncloaking the SACAP codes, which Mary is willing to compile on an  annual basis so that we can continue to see gaps in coverage. <br />
          **Carol Mitchell asked for suggestions for profiling  tools for SACAP including a shopping cart approach.&nbsp; Seeing in one place what has been picked up  from LC and what has not might be very helpful to SACAP members.<br />
          **Jim Nye agreed that starting at home in the US is good, but we should also consider international  sharing, including interlibrary loan from Canada, Japan, and Russia. More data-gathering about interlibrary loan would be  helpful since we want to document the activity outside SACAP as well. <br />
          **Don Johnson said it would be wonderful for the group  to get the summary report out to ALA and other area studies groups.&nbsp; </p>
         
        <p> <a name="bas" id="bas"></a> <b>Bibliography of Asian Studies (BAS)</b> Frank Conlon (conlon@u.washington.edu), BAS Managing  Director, described the evolution of the journal from its origins as a print  supplement to the <i>Far Eastern Quarterly. </i>Efforts  to speed UNICODE compliance are underway, and the editorial team is working to  clarify what content is fast track and what isn&rsquo;t. An AAS administrator is the  figure of continuity, and AAS subsidizes the journal. Watch for developments  for SFX and Endnote.</p>
         
        <p> <a href=#top><img align=right alt="Back to the top" src="../im/top20.gif" border=0 height=20 width=39></a> <a name="vscripts" id="vscripts"></a> <b>Vernacular Scripts</b> At Alan Grosenheider&rsquo;s request, Tim invited the group  to continue the discussion of vernacular scripts.&nbsp; <br />
          **Some people have looked at the service coming soon  from DK Agencies, and have found nicely done, clean records. DK is ready to  convert batches of records as well. David Nelson added that Penn&rsquo;s Voyager  system works well with all except Oriya and possibly Tibetan. Questions about  pricing remain.<br />
          **Jim Nye reported that work with Wisconsin&rsquo;s Mark Foster, who is contributing pro bono, have  been most encouraging.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foster is  developing software that will convert records in batches of individual  languages.&nbsp; Jim watched the program work  with 4,044 Tamil records. Wisconsin  will make the software available for use.&nbsp;  Smart logic is still beyond reach, and records with transliteration  flaws won&rsquo;t be converted flawlessly. <br />
          **Jim also reported that in the subcontinent tens of  thousands of records have been uploaded and flipped to Romanization, and  reverse flips are possible. Permissions to load and share revenue are in  process. <br />
          **Jim, David, and Alan will keep in contact and report  new developments.</p>
         
        <p> <a name="elec" id="elec"></a> <b>Review of New Electronic Resources</b> The group shared impressions of <i>Manupatra</i>, which is widely used in India, <i>Indlaw, </i>and  Alexander Street Press&rsquo;s <i>South and  Southeast Asian Literature.</i></p>
