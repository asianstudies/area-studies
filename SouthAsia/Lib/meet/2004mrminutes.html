from South Asia Council Meeting: </B></FONT><BR>

Tim Bryson reported on his presentation to the South Asia Council (SAC)
meeting of the Association for Asian Studies (AAS). In addition to
updating SAC on CONSALD&acute;s activities, he re-requested support for
3 faculty members to attend the CONSALD meetings; SAC responded that if
CONSALD will provide them with a list of five or six names (they thought
we would have a better sense what faculty members would be good) that
they would appoint 3 to CONSALD at their next meeting and even possibly
offer to pay their way, if necessary. SAC approved our request to change
the by-laws to include the CRL representative as an ex-officio member of
CONSALD&acute;s executive board. SAC made the following requests:</P>

<P>&nbsp;* Have the CONSALD Chair make a report annually to SAC at AAS. <BR>

&nbsp;* Continue with conference workshops on South Asia resources. <BR>

&nbsp;* Forward the names of any South Asia university contacts to SAC
to help them with their program to invite scholars to the US. (Martha
Selby, Anita Weiss) They are interested in contacts in Pakistan and
Bangladesh as well as India. <BR>

&nbsp;* Help improve access (both bibliographical and physical) to
dissertations from South Asia. (Tony Stewart) <BR>

&nbsp;* Use any leverage available to have the Office of Epigraphy of
the Archaeological Survey stop the lamination of primary materials.

<FONT SIZE="+0"><B>5. Bibliography of Asian Studies:</B></FONT><BR>

Aruna Kuruganti reported on the current status of the Bibliography of
Asian Studies (BAS). At present, there are over 600,000 records in the
BAS and all records for currently indexed titles have been updated
through November of 2003 (the most recent upload being from 15 February
2004). The South Asia indexing for the BAS is being done based on
Columbia&acute;s collection of serials. If others want to help
contribute records or alert Aruna based on their own collections, please
contact her. Please also contact Aruna or Frank Conlon
(conlon@u.washington.edu) if you find errors or would like to give
feedback on the BAS. </P>

<P>Monica Ghosh asked for a list of all South Asian journals indexed in
the BAS; David Magier will update the existing list from SARAI and will
alert us when it&acute;s ready. Tim Bryson invited Aruna to regularly
attend the CONSALD meetings to update us on the BAS. Related to the BAS
discussion, it was pointed out that the Ford Foundation is going to give
money to JSTOR to increase its South Asian content. [See <A

<P><FONT SIZE="+0"><B>7.Elections: </B></FONT><BR>

Alan Grosenheider and Merry Burlingham nominated four candidates for the
executive committee. Subsequent to these nominations, however, it was
learned that we had four slots to fill. Therefore, in lieu of elections,
all four candidates were appointed to the executive committee. The new
executive committee will negotiate how to stagger the terms, who will be
chair and secretary/treasurer, etc. Newly appointed executive committee
members are: Rajwant Chilana, David Magier, David Nelson and Mary Rader.

<B>A) Islamabad:</B><BR>

Will Tuchrello is the interim field director for the Islamabad office.
For security reasons, especially because the LOC office is outside of
the Embassy, the Department of State rejected LOC's request to have the
American supervisor resident in Islamabad. Thus, Will will commute from
New Delhi, thanks to the graciousness of his colleague Laila Mulgaokar.
He provided an outline, <A HREF="2004mrislamabad.html"
TARGET="_blank">attached</A>, which outlines his plan for the present
year. He reported that he has been asked to perform a cost-benefit
analysis of the office and to report his findings to Judy McDermott. The
Islamabad office activities will be focused on three main areas:
security, finances and cleaning-up of the office. His first priority
will be to work on the budget and an analysis of participant accounts.
Will believes the office needs to become more automated (for example the
shipping and serials databases) and that services will reduced at least
until the office is put in order. He will make greater use of the
bibliographic utilities for CAP access.  Will wants to get LC and
participant materials out of the office faster; he hopes that they will
be processed and out of the office within 30 days (this is related in
high but he hopes to revise them over the next year. He proposes sending
participants an advance notice regarding supplemental bills when
accounts have a 20% balance. In response to a question regarding the
I&amp;O charges, LC staff noted that the I&amp;O for 2003-2004 was
estimated at 61% as charges are formula based on the previous years
budget. With the final accounting completed the LC staff in attendance
noted that it now appears that the actual costs were 38%.  The
reductions will be corrected and adjusted soon. The office is working on
developing their Afghan program and is also going to do a longitudinal
study of the central Asian countries to see if they can acquire
materials routinely and maybe create a program. The office is also in
contact with the National Archives and they are looking into
collaborating on preservation projects. Finally, Will had some questions
for us: should they continue to bind materials in Islamabad and how will
this slow down the shipping of materials out of the office? How shall
the office make controversial materials available without offending
governments (perhaps select based on profile or create a new profile)?

Delhi:</B></FONT><BR>

Laila Mulgaokar reports that in combination with the new ambassador, the
government is set to increase the size of the Delhi embassy; whether or
not the LC offices will move to the embassy compound is unclear. The
Delhi office had a cut of $70,000 from their operating budget; this has
led to the cancellation of the proposed vendors conference, among other
things. The office would like to focus on finding difficult to acquire
materials. The Sri Lanka office is improving and will soon be able to
input into the serials databases directly; the Nepal office is having
trouble, in part because acquisitions trips are limited by the embassy.
(A literary recordings trip is scheduled for Nepal in May.) The office
would like to send emails to participants when their balance is 20-25%
to give advanced notice of the need for supplementary bills; after such
a notice, activity will be stopped until the Delhi office hears from
participants or more money is deposited into the accounts. The
cataloging unit in Delhi is still understaffed for the following
languages: Urdu, Hindi, Sinhala, Mongolian, Manipuri, and Divehi. They
have struggled to find an Urdu cataloger and will (re)open the search
again soon. In the meantime, materials in those languages await
cataloging. Carol will mail out CDs with files of active, inactive and
really inactive (dead) serial titles. The Delhi office refuses to pay
for materials in dollars; however, participants may request special
purchase of materials that publishers/vendors refuse to sell in rupees
(the office will facilitate the purchase). Both Laila and Carol would
like to visit all participating institutions (for example, Laila will
visit the Research Triangle this spring). The real I &amp; O for 2003
was 14%, not the 30% charged; amendments/corrections will be made to
bills/balances. LC- Washington is sending bound, print newspapers to
Delhi to film. In addition, there may be new activity for the MIPP
project; the Indian Minister of Culture may give permission for the
filming of some 400 NBIL titles (without any GoI funding). LC still has
a serials moratorium; the implication is that although serials will
still be acquired and circularized, they will be cataloged as a
&#147;not for LC title&#148; and therefore will not have call numbers in
the records.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+0"><B>C) LC-Washington: </B></FONT><BR>
Fehl Cannon reports that the most efficient way to pay participant bills
is through credit card or electronic transfer (if paying by EFT, please
include the invoice number). Checks continue to be a problem. Whatever
form of payment is made, please contact Fehl when the payment is made so
he can try to track it. In relation to the &#147;prompt payment
act,&#148; please pay balances soon as possible. The costs of security
at the field offices will be shared; this will ultimately effect the
I&amp;O costs. </P>

David Magier reported on <B>SARAI</B>. As the SARAI backlog is growing,
David would like to &#147;outsource&#148; particular sections of it. So
far, Alan Grosenheider has taken charge of the religion and philosophy
section; if others would like to participate, please contact David.
SARAI&acute;s country sections are based upon and necessitated by the
WWW Virtual Library demands; it may be that SARAI will consider
alternatives to these arrangements. David clarified the SARAI-DSAL
distinctions: SARAI is for external content and DSAL is for DSAL created
content.</P>

<P> David also reported on <B>oral histories in digital format</B> that
will be housed (served up?) from the oral history research office at
Columbia. Included in these collections will be accounts from the
Bangladesh liberation war in English, Bengali and Urdu. The hope is to
expand this project to other displaced communities. </P>

<P> Jim Nye reported on the <B>South Asia Union Catalog</B> which has
received funding from the Ford Foundation ($90,000). The first phase of
the catalog is to focus on southern South Asia, in particular records
from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamilnadu, the Maldives and Sri
Lanka, and should cover materials from approximately 1556 onwards. So
far, there are approximately 600,000 records to seed the catalog
(including 370,000 from LC). Catalog participants will be attending a
training session next month in Calcutta, run in part by Sunita Murti
from LC-Delhi. The delivery protocols (Z39.50 server, etc.) are being
worked out and the expectation will be that the catalog will have both
an OPAC interface as well as access to the MARC records. </P>

<P> Jim also reported that in May 2003, <B>the Center for South Asia
Libraries held a meeting in Sri Lanka</B>. Attendees included
librarians, academics, and representatives from AIPS, AIIS, CRL, LC and
CAORC. Among other outcomes from this meeting were the Union Catalog
proposal (see above) and the associated training sessions. </P>

<P> Reporting on <B>activities from CRL</B>, James Simon noted that they
continue to catalog their foreign dissertations collection; that they
are outsourcing the processing of some of their materials; that they
have a newly posted South Asian cataloging position; that there is a new
grant proposal to support ICON; and that the recently approved purchase
proposals included some South Asian content, notably continued coverage
of the Times of India and more selections from the Church Missionary
Society’s archives.</P>
