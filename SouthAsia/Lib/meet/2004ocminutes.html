1. <A
HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/2004mrminutes.html"
TARGET="_blank"><B>Minutes</B></A> were read silently and approved. [It
was suggested to SAC representatives Anita Weiss and Michael Fisher that
they consider inviting South Asian librarians, as well as faculty
members/scholars, to attend AAS meetings.  M. Rader will follow up on
those developments.]</P>

<P><A NAME="#treas"></A>
2. <B>Treasurer's Report</B>. D. Nelson reported that the CONSALD
account has a balance of $722.66 with no expenditures during the past
year.</P>

<P><A NAME="pair"></A>
3. Wayne Hayes, Project manager for the <B>Portal to Asian Internet
Resources</B>, gave a presentation on PAIR. A number of new features
have been added including a new manager, site, URL and a number of new
records. There has been a nearly fourfold increase in the number of
South Asia related records from 2001 to the present (385 area records -
1284 area records).
 URL: <A HREF="http://webcat.library.wisc.edu:3200/PAIR/"
TARGET="_blank">http://webcat.library.wisc.edu:3200/PAIR/</A>.  New
developments include true [native] script capabilities including
searching using Unicode. Records are all entered into OCLC and thus
appear in WorldCat. Includes a section on featured or newly added
resources. Wayne gave a demonstration on site searching in PAIR.
Upcoming plans include working with the Central Eurasian Digital
Infrastructure to digitize 500 critical texts as well as provide an
e-publication repository. Plans are also underway to conduct annual
virtual conferences.</P>

<P>Question: will you have scripted titles, the
Romanized transliteration side by side -- yes: both forms appear in the
full record display.</P>

<P><A NAME="dsal"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A> 4. Jerry Hall, <B><A
HREF="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/" TARGET="_blank">DSAL</A></B>. A handout
on DSAL usage was distributed. Over 1 million hits per month and
downloading has doubled. DSAL remains on the first page in a Google
search.  There are now nearly 15K images from AIIS; 2k added this year.
Plans are underway to digitize Schwartzberg's Historical Atlas. The 26
volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer have been scanned. Expect more
dictionaries to come up in the near term. </P>

<P>Open Archives Initiative: made arrangements with the U. of Chicago
Library to be a data provider and have also had discussions with U. of
Michigan and U. of Illinois on how to make possible for other people to
put up their metadata and objects in OAI.</P>

<P>Comment for Jerry: Summarize the status for the digital dictionaries
implementation.  What will come up and when? Query was fielded by Jim
Nye.</P>

<P>Work is continuing; currently adding Perso-Arabic script and other
scripts to relevant dictionaries. We are expecting the release of some
15 dictionaries in the next several months; they are in beta-testing
right now. Delivery has also been made of 3 additional dictionaries
during the past month. Contracts continue to be written.</P>

<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"

5. Jim Nye gave an overview of the <B><A
HREF="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/sauc/" TARGET="_blank">South Asia Union
Catalog</A></B> which will cover the years 1556-1947 for Phase I (South
India and Sri Lanka). Phase II will encompass regions of Orissa, Bengal
and Assam and Colonial Burma. A funding source has been identified.
Phase III -- Hindi speaking region (including Nepal) and Gujarat and
Maharashtra will be submitted to DOE. Phase IV, a funding has not yet
been identified will be for Afghanistan (primarily Perso-Arabic
scripts).</P>

<P>There are currently 360K records from LC and 300K records from other
sources. Regional scripts are included where applicable. CDS-ISIS is the
database software.  Holding libraries will be added to the record.</P>

<P><A NAME="jstor"></A>
6. David Magier led a discussion on the question of <A
HREF="http://www.jstor.org/" TARGET="_blank">JSTOR</A> and serial titles
from South Asia that can be included in their ongoing scanning program.
Discussed were questions such as what would be appropriate methodologies
for selecting titles, how to submit titles to JSTOR for consideration,
how to determine core journals, purpose of JSTOR itself and its interest
in expanding its journal list to be of more interest to a world-wide
audience, who to contact at JSTOR, should the suggested list of journals
be limited to South Asia or include Southeast Asia also, etc. One
possible technique is to look at the hits on BAS (look at bookbag and
journal browse) Frank and David will find out if possible to extract
relevant statistics from BAS.  Mary Rader will contact JSTOR to discuss
CONSALD's interest in submitting serial titles for scanning.</P>

<P><A NAME="aiis"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A> 7. Lisa Klopfer (Asst.
Professor and Librarian, Bruce T. Halle Library Eastern Michigan
University) gave a slide presentation on her <B>AIIS library funded
project</B> in Pune that focused on the users of small private stall
libraries run by entrepreneurs. She explored the functions of these
small lending libraries. For those interested in more information on her
project, Lisa can be contacted at <A HREF="mailto:lklopfer at
emich.edu">lklopfer at emich.edu</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="diaspor"></A>
8. Allen Thrasher brought up the issue of the <B>retention of diasporic
newspapers published in the USA</B> and what should we do with them?
There are over 30 Bengali weeklies in the NY area alone. It is not clear
how many titles are covered in <I>Ethnic News Watch</I> which are,
however, English only titles.  Allen will try to get sample issues of
serials once freeze on serials is lifted. Allen posed a number of
questions: is this a CRL type activity? Or can people agree that they
could obtain those titles published in their respective states&#151;that
is, for documenting their own state.</P>

<P>Jim Nye observed that the U.S. Newspaper program still lives and this
topic would be in scope for this program. (see <A
HREF="http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html"
TARGET="_blank">http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html</A> for
description and scope).  Some libraries, such as the Queens Library in
NY, might have a large holdings of newspapers of interest to us. Jim Nye
suggested that perhaps we could keep only specimen issues in a manner
similar to the British during the colonial period.</P>

<P>Monica Ghosh raised the question of what exactly is a diasporic
publication? At Hawaii, for example, the emphasis is on the "-American"
part of the hyphen.</P>

<P>The discussion will be continued at AAS in Chicago.</P>

<P>Overall, this topic generated a lively discussion on a number of related issues.</P>

<P><A NAME="scripts"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A> 9. David Nelson gave a short
summary of the ALA Summer 2004 program entitled <I>Library Catalogs and
<B>Non-Roman Scripts</B>: Development and Implementation of
UnicodeTM&#160;for Cataloging and Public Access</I>.  He drew particular
attention to the useful and informative paper by Jack Cain on library
issues concerning Unicode implementation (<A
HREF="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2004/2004-report01.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2004/2004-report01.pdf</A>).

<P><A NAME="search"></A>
10. Merry Burlingham brought up the issue of <B>federated searching</B>.
One matter is that South Asia materials are not compatible with the
systems such as OneBox. (<A
HREF="http://www.google.com/help/interpret.html#H"
TARGET="_blank">http://www.google.com/help/interpret.html#H</A>)
Undergraduate instruction tends to focus only on the large
multidisciplinary databases, yet a large number of our types of searches
require accessing various databases while at the same time, undergrads
tend to not want to undertake such searching strategies.</P>

<P>David M. observed that there are several issues here: the actual
construction of a federated searching system or simply the useful
grouping together of databases relevant to South Asia studies. In
searching, one needs both a search box (command line) and browse
capability -- to be able to go from the specific to the more general.
Columbia has looked at a number of software solutions for federated
searching, and the one that seemed to be the best was the one used at
the Cleveland Public Library. They have something called OneSearch (<A
HREF="http://www.cpl.org/LinksLibrary.asp?FormMode=DBNew"
TARGET="_blank">http://www.cpl.org/LinksLibrary.asp?FormMode=DBNew</A>)
. Problems associated with general federated search structures were
discussed.</P>

11. <B>LC Report</B>. Carol Mitchell reporting. Judy McDermott retired
on Oct. 1, 2004 and Lygia Ballantyne is the Acting Head of OvOp. Laila
was interested in knowing if it would be useful for her to also set
aside time for meeting with South Asia librarians at the various
conferences. Carol reported that there had been a vendor conference in
Delhi for vendor training where collection issues, business issues, and
business practices.  There was a discussion on overhead cost differences
between the various offices and the reasons for the difference.</P>

<P>Rukhsana Saood gave the report for Islamabad. Will T. is still field
director for Islamabad and commutes regularly from his stay in Delhi.
There have been efforts to process a number of back volumes. There have
been a number of improvements to SACAP with increased acquisition
efforts, notably the Kabul tour.</P>

<P>The matter of serials back issues was brought up. The question of
whether or not English and non-English books can be separated when
shipped&#151;for Delhi this not possible, but perhaps so for Islamabad.
Monica asked if we will see the bill spike again and the answer was
no.</P>

<P>David M. asked what special and ephemeral materials from Pakistan or
Afghanistan will be coming in? In this regard he mentioned the special
project that had been underway with Judy McDermott: "America in the eyes
of the Islamic World" in which posters, political ephemera, textbooks,
etc.</P>

<P>Jim Nye posed a question if there can be a greater CRL involvement
Perhaps follow the CRL model for acquiring microform sets. The question
of where will the funding come from was raised. A discussion on this
issue ensued.</P>

<P>David M. asked if they are going to get Uzbek materials -- will not
acquire in Uzbekistan, but if found elsewhere will pick up.</P>

<P>Rukhsana S. stated that the Perso-Arabic script is still not added to
the catalog records, this matter is under discussion.</P>

<P>Carol M. reported that the Nepal coordinator has left. The new
coordinator has been hired and this person should be able to bring
things to date. There is now an Urdu cataloger in Delhi.</P>

<P>Serial freeze is still on.</P>

<P>Sri Lanka acquisitions problem and there will be a solution this year
but dealers are sending materials through. The Malayalam cataloger is
now independent and also does Sinhala.</P>

<P>LC will take care of the reply button problem.</P>

<P>Atish C. When making special request please specify how the item
should be sent back.</P>

<P>Reprints are usually for pre-1950 titles as the selection criterion.
David M. suggest pre-1960 -- which would be just prior to the inception
of the program. These will continue to be circularized.</P>

<P>Please send requests to generic address and individual liaison person
will send reply within 48 hours.</P>

<P>There has been an increase in the coverage by state and subject. They will try to
acquire more regional films.</P>

<A NAME="binding"></A>
<P>Binding question. Can they send books/pamphlets not bound. There is
often a problem with the gutters.<BR>

[See <A HREF="200411binding.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Addendem to notes:
Binding Policy statement</B></A>, 22 November 2004]</P>

<P>Serial question by Don.: Don't put label on bottom of spine.</P>

<P>Carol solicited locations for travel. Rejection rate was around 50%
and they want to get that down to 20-25%. Acquisition will be calling
dealers monthly and now have 26 dealers.</P>
