<P><A NAME="cata"></A>
<FONT SIZE="+0"><B>
VI. South Asian Union Catalogue:</B></FONT><BR> James Nye introduced the
South Asia Union Catalogue to the group. The Union Catalogue has been
given a 3-year, $90,000 grant through the Ford Foundation. The Union
Catalogue will cover the period 1556 to the present and will be
available on a free website. LC is mining its own database for records
to populate the database. Within the next 1-2 months, they Union
Catalogue expects to have approximately 500,000 records. After the
initial influx of records, the project will focus on South Indian and
Sri Lankan imprints (the next immediate target will be the northeast of
South Asia). If anyone is willing to submit their own unique/original
records, please contact Jim. </P>

<FONT SIZE="+0"><B>
VII. South Asia Microfilm Project or SAMP:</B></FONT><BR> James Simon
briefly presented the new collaborative space for SAMP through
Intraspect.crl.edu. At this website, members will be able to archive
email, share documents, conduct discussions, etc. SAMP members should
expect to hear more about this soon.</P>

<P><A NAME="core"></A>
<FONT SIZE="+0"><B>
VIII. Core Journals:</B></FONT><BR>
David Nelson asked the group about preparing a list of &#147;core&#148;
journals to be recommended to small libraries, including those where our
students find jobs. Jim Nye and Merry Burlingham suggested RLG&acute;s
project &#147;Red light green&#148; as a possible resource (see
http://www.redlightgreen.com). LC also suggested consulting its
&#147;core&#148; journals lists through SCIMS. No action was taken.</P>

<P><A NAME="index"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../im/top20.gif" HEIGHT="20" WIDTH="39"

<FONT SIZE="+0"><B>
IX. Journal Indexing:</B></FONT><BR> Merry Burlingham raised the
question of journal indexing on behalf of David Magier and the potential
comm. on same which would include Allen Thrasher. Where are new journals
being indexed (if anywhere) and how are we finding out where they are
indexed? Do we see gaps while assisting faculty and students with
research? If a project to verify indexing of South Asian journals is to
be undertaken, we need to define the universe before asking for
volunteers from the group. Two approaches were suggested: 1) Explore the
model of TOCs used by the Latin Americanists via UT-LANIC; or 2) Select
a group of titles based on number of subscribing libraries within
SACAP--say 10 or more--which began after a specific date.  Merry
surmised that David might need additional information on other titles
for the AAS meeting in order to continue some of the funding for the
South Asia portion of the BAS. She will follow up with David.</P>

X. LC Presentations:</B></FONT></P>

<P>
<B>Fred Protopappas</B> announced that LC fully expects to keep the
Islamabad office open without a reduction in staff. So far, they do not
have any authorization for an American staff person although they are
considering a number of possibilities to handle the work. Currently,
James Gentner visits Islamabad for 2 weeks approximately every 3 months.
Fred will do more research into the 61% overhead for the Islamabad
program but suspects that this rate is due to increased staff costs,
etc. </P>

<P><A NAME="circ"></A>
XI. Some discussion ensued about the <B>LC circulars</B> from both Delhi
and Islamabad. For circulars necessitated by cost, it was agreed that
$75 should be the cut-off point for circulars. Where feasible, the LC
offices will give us one month to respond to circulars. Both LC offices
request that we try to respond quickly to circulars.</P>

<P><A NAME="mulg"></A>
<B>XII. Laila Mulgaokar</B> would like participants to email her with
any and all questions about the program. She is in the process of
re-assessing the Sri Lankan acquisitions. Due to security issues in
Washington, clearances at customs have become erratic and this may slow
down receipts to participants. The Delhi office now has a digital
camera. Carol and Laila will be taking a trip to Nepal soon for the
literary recordings project as well as an acquisitions trip to
Bangladesh. The Delhi offices will no longer be putting bibliographic
slips in the books shipped from their offices, although the stickers on
the front of the books will remain.</P>

<P><A NAME="mitc"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../im/top20.gif" HEIGHT="20" WIDTH="39"
ALT="Back to the top" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A>
<B>XIII. Carol Mitchell</B> reconfirmed that the LC office will not
supply books that are dually published with a U.S.  publisher. Although
reprints continue to be circularized, those without publication dates or
otherwise improperly cited will not be picked up through LC. When
participants change their profiles, please alert both the DC and Delhi
offices. The Delhi office will send an email and a letter confirming the
changes. The Delhi office is looking into simplifying the geographic
areas of the profile and will perhaps suggest working towards larger
geographic groupings. The Delhi office is happy to provide sub-invoices
for divisional libraries, etc; they can generate these invoices and
reports for participants based on requested criteria. The Delhi office
has a new Malayalam cataloger but they are still searching for a new
Urdu cataloger. At this time, approximately 75% of cataloging is done in
Delhi itself. However, they are not &#147;independent&#148; for non-book
items or certain call number ranges. </P>

<P><A NAME="rahm"></A>
<B>XIV. Nuzhat Rahman</B> announced that the Islamabad office has seen
at 10-15% increase in publishing and a 10-15% increase in book prices in
Pakistan. For example, in 2001, they supplied 1083 titles, 1793 in 2002
and 3744 in 2003. They continue to be short staffed in Islamabad. While
commercial publications are relatively easy to acquire, government
publications are increasingly difficult to acquire. For example, the
NWFP have stopped giving LC copies of the gazetteer, etc. For
controversial and/or ephemeral literatures, participants should contact
the Islamabad office directly. The Islamabad office is seeking a new box
vendor. </P>
