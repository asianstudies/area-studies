<A NAME="treasurer"></A>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. <B>Treasurer's Report: </B></FONT>Adnan Malik gave
the treasurer's report. Currently, CONSALD has $707.90 in its account.
</P>

<A NAME="projects"></A>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>5. Project Updates and New Initiatives</B>:</FONT></P>

<P><B>Cataloging of Rare Buddhist Sanskrit Manuscripts</B>: Ken Harvey
of ProQuest announced the completion of the project cataloging rare
Buddhist Sanskrit manuscripts. He acknowledged Bronwen Bledsoe's help in
the project. The cataloging follows on consultation with CONSALD last
spring. He will give a hard copy to Bronwen, which she will share with
others on request. He will also provide information about the person who
did the cataloging.</P>

<P><B>Journal Indexing Project</B>: Mary Rader gave an update on the
South Asia Journal Indexing project. She explained how journals were
added to the project based on a two-pronged approach. Firstly, search
current indexes and find South Asia content. If India is listed for
three articles, the index is included. Secondly, search for journals
that exist but are not indexed. For this all the sources provided by LC
Islamabad and Delhi in all languages are included. The net result is
that about sixty indexes are included in the project. David Magier
suggested that this approach might miss publications from outside the US
and South Asia, like Australia. Mary said that problem will be tackled
by going through standard lists, like Garaham Shaw's list of
periodicals, later. The site for the project is alive, and Mary
requested those present to use it and inform her of errors and problems.
David agreed to add the site to SARAI. Mary also announced that she was
working on a grant proposal to get funding for the project, specifically
for what should be indexed and has not been. Bronwen Bledsoe, Amar
Gurung, Sundar Ganesan, and Adnan Malik will also participate in the
project.  </P>

<P><B>Roja Muthiah Research Library, Cennai, India</B>: Sundar Ganesan
gave a brief introduction to the RMRL. Among the prominent activities of
the institution, he mentioned the indexing of Tamil journals;
preservation of material, including runs of the Madras Christian College
Magazine, Madras Musings and other rare imprints; collecting posters;
cataloging in cooperation with other institutions, like Oxford and
Cambridge Universities; and Microfilm duplication and digitization. </P>

<P><B>Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya, Lalitpur, Nepal</B>: Amar Gurung of
the MPP gave a presentation on MPP. Named after a famous literary prize,
the MPP houses a Nepali only collection of 22,000 monographs, 4,100
periodicals and 600 rolls of microfilm. MPP is a repository for
manuscripts, tapes, photographs, and contemporary materials, like
posters, etc. It is starting a new project concerned with the modern
political history of Nepal. Future plans for the institution include
expanding to other languages and to foreign publications.  </P>

<P><B>CRL Updates</B>: James Simon reported on the transition of GRN
from ARL, Association of Research Libraries, to CRL as its new home.
This is the initiative to work on solutions to help provide access to
foreign language resources. DSAL was one such seed project. They tend to
focus on technological problems but not exclusively. The aim is to
foster collaborative projects addressing questions like, how we collect,
what we collect and how we serve. They also are interested in figuring
out new ways to work with partners, e.g., a digital library for
international research.</P>

<P><B>DSAL Update</B>: Jerry Hall invited people to see what is new on
DSAL's web site as a new operating system has led to new changes. New
additions include 2 new collections of photographs from WW II, namely,
the Bond and the Keagle Collections. There are also 2 new resources of
picture books of Indian natives selected from the Oudh Punch, along with
8,000 more distinct images. Two more dictionaries have been added. These
include a Marathi-English, and a Bengali-Bengali dictionary, the latter
being the first mono-lingual dictionary in the collection. DSAL's web
page now carries a link to the SA Union catalog, and will soon also
carry one for RMRL's Tamil collection. Schwartzberg's historical
atlases, which are some of the most complicated digital documents, will
also go up soon. Samples of the zoomification of the images of maps are
already in place.</P>

<P>James Simon talked about TICFIA, the Technological Innovation and
Cooperation Foreign Grant. March 31st was the end of phase II, and now
the 3rd phase has begun. He talked about the complications of the
grant's funding. Phase III covers North Central SA, including Nepal.
James also reported on the good progress of the sound archive of the
Linguistic Survey of India. Another aspect of the TICFIA project will be
the selection and preservation of journal articles and their indexing.
The last component will be document delivery from SA to Title VI and
CONSALD members, focusing on material not available in the US, like
journal articles. The last phase of the grant is supposed to continue
into 2009. Many wondered who is considered a CONSALD member to benefit
from this. Some suggested the CONSALD listserve, which currently has
about 80 subscribers, might offer a starting point to deal with this
question.</P>

<P><B>South Asia Union Catalog</B>: James Nye reported that phase II,
covering Bengal, Burma and Orissa, had just been funded. Abhijit
Bhattacharya of Calcutta Social Science Institute will be in charge of
phase II. Training for the project was already taking place, thanks to
LC Delhi. There are likely prospects OCLC will approve credits for
records added at about $4.40 per record. They are not just interested in
full level, but also K level minimal records. The Union Catalog will
have its own symbol. The British library has also agreed in principle to
distribute all of its unique items through the Union Catalog. These
would include the old BL catalogs that are not included in OCLC. These
records will be loaded into OCLC via the Union Catalog and the revenue
will be share between BL and the Union Catalog.</P>

<P><B>Mushfiq Khwaja Collection</B>: Jim Nye reported that three weeks
ago, Anwar Muazzam, who introduced the MKC to Jim, signed an agreement
to purchase the collection in collaboration with AIPS. The latter will
also take care of admin and maintenance.  Invoices will be going out to
those who wanted to participate. After purchase, the collection will
remain in Karachi, where, thanks to Mark Kenoyer of AIPS, the government
of Pakistan will donate land and help construct a new building not only
for this collection but also others. Four people have already contacted
for their collections.  Mansur Ahmad, Jamil Jalibi, etc., will be on an
advisory panel for the collection.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>6. Results of E-election:</B></FONT> Merry
Burlingham and Philip McEldowney became new members of the executive
committee. Thanks to David Magier and Rajwant Chilana who stepped down.
</P>

<A NAME="reviseconstitution"></A>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>7. Proposal to Streamline and Revise
Constitution:</B></FONT></P>

<P>Mary Rader put forward the suggestion, originally proposed by Don
Johnson, that articles IV and V of the constitution be amended. The
amendments should aim at firstly, reducing the size of the executive
committee by eliminating ex-officio members, and, secondly, increase the
term of office for office holders from two to three years. Merry
suggested it would only be fair if the vote be carried out via email, as
everyone concerned was not present. David Magier suggested that
communication with SAC also needs to be cleaned up. Avinash Maheshwari
proposed that office holders only be allowed to serve for two terms in a
row. This proposal was carried, but will also be included in the e-vote.
Jim Nye questioned the rationale of excluding ex-officio members because
it would compromise questions of continuity. On being asked by Tim
Bryson to clarify if by continuity he meant programming activities, Jim
Nye said he had a broader understanding in mind, including the power of
CONSALD to represent the group in important decisions, like PL480. It
was decided, at the suggestion of Allen Thrasher, that the new executive
committee will put together a summary of this discussion and present it
to the entire CONSALD membership when they are asked to vote on the
changes to the constitution. It was decided that the proposed changes
will be treated as separate issues, hence votes will be solicited on: 1.
reducing the number of members of the executive committee, 2. abolishing
the membership of ex-officio members 3. Increasing the time served in
office from 2 to 3 years.</P>

<P>David Magier suggested that perhaps the traditional meeting time for
CONSALD meetings had to be changed in order to allow more members to
attend. He recommended holding the meetings on Wednesdays. However,
there was little enthusiasm for it because, as Avinash put it, this
would put further strain on travel budgets and discourage people from
coming altogether. David proposed to send out this question of moving
the meetings to Wednesdays to the entire membership. It was carried as
proposed.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>8. Library of Congress Update:</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>James Gentner</B>: Lygia Ballantine retired. This was one among
many retirements in the Asia division. Carol Mitchell is the current
acting field director in Cairo and Islamabad and James Gentner is the
acting chief. James will go back to Cairo in June.  The LC team
responsible for US copyright will also deal with foreign copyright
issues.  </P>

<P>There is more pressure to get shelf-ready catalog records. Provision
of Voyager facilities will make that possible and allow for more
material with full cataloging and spine labels etc. </P>

<P>Islamabad field director position was posted earlier and will close
soon. The chief position in Rio is also open.</P>

<P><B>Laila Mulgaokar</B>: Laila has taken on some of Carol's duties, as
have Atish, Ramsaran, Sunita and others. Her position will not get
filled soon. The Tamil backlog is building up because the Tamil
cataloger had a stroke. There is no Tamil expertise right now. The
position will only be filled if the cataloger retires. Sanjeev Mukherjee
cannot come back and will retire on disability. Washington DC has taken
on the responsibility to do Burmese cataloging. The Thai cataloger has
left LC, and Will Tucello will take that on. The Thai position will not
be filled in Delhi. The situation in Sri Lanka will come to a head soon.
The program will have to be redone from bottom up. Atish will go there
shortly for an acquisition trip. Details will become clear in the next
couple of months.  He has started with lists of serials with the largest
number of participants, and will go for back issues. Sub offices other
than Sri Lanka are on track. The new Nepal person is in training but
conditions there are bad. Burma is fine. All are moving to new embassy
compounds. LC Delhi will move in June 2007. </P>

<P>Mr. Rakesh Sharma has not been heard from since. Not heard from Mr.
Patwardhan either.  LC Delhi will look at the fine print on DVDs more
closely in order to avoid future copyright wrangles. LC Delhi will not
pay US price for any DVD etc., whether in dollars or Indian equivalent.
Generally, LC is able to convince vendors to provide material at Indian
prices. It is important to note that India does not recognize public
domain and that government publications are not public domain. </P>

<P>The National Agricultural Library has dropped out of all LC
acquisition programs. LC Delhi will identify serial titles only being
purchased for NAL and will see how many are on technical agriculture.
Those on general agriculture will be acquired for LC.</P>

<P>Laila will talk to LC counsel in DC about dual imprints and get back
to CONSALD. LC Delhi will continue to provide lists of titles they will
not supply. CDs of serial titles will be mailed soon. Many send serials
claims to DC instead of Delhi. This causes huge delays. Serials claims
should be sent to Delhi directly. Please copy Laila on emails. The list
of 2001 Census of India titles along with their prices will me emailed
soon. It will be hard for LC Delhi to separate English and non-English
titles for shipping as David Magier had requested. </P>

<P>In response to Merry's question about whether it was possible to
upload the electronic copy of acquisition data to local datafiles James
Gentner clarified that these records will be created under CAPS, the
Corporate Acquisition Program System, which is a joint effort among LC
Delhi, Cairo and Jakarta. These will be MARC21 records that could be
loaded to local OPACs.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>9. Round Robin:</B></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><B>Tim Bryson, Emory University</B>: Emory acquired two new
professors from UW Madison who are interested in Tibetan material.
Hence, Emory needs more Tibetan books.</P>

<P><B>Mel Hatcher, genealogical Soiety of Utah</B>: Mel reported on a
pilot project in Moga, Indian Panjab (?), to film village records along
with pedigree records. These will go down to the 1960s. The resultant
dataset will have information on pedigree and other related
documents.</P>

<P><B>Catherine Lee, UCLA:</B> UCLA will have a new South Asia
librarian. His name is Liladhar Pendse, and he will be the South Asia
and Slavic librarian.</P>

<P><B>University of Washington</B>: Merry announced that the University
of Washington will soon have a new South Asia librarian. Her name is
Deepa Bannerjee.  </P>

<P><B>Merry Burlingham, University Of Texas, Austin</B>: Shanti Kumar is
leaving Madison to join the Radio and TV Program at UT Austin. The South
Asia environment position will also soon be filled. </P>

<P><B>Philip McEldowney, University Of Virginia</B>: After three years
have moved from the 5th to the 2nd floor. UV received five truck loads
of donations from the Library of the Study of Religion, New York. Quite
a few of the titles are on music. A number of digital images of Tibet
have been cataloged. Many of them have print copies as well.  Philip
visited Australia and New Zealand in February.</P>

<P><B>Saima Fazli</B>: Saima is currently working at UC, Berkeley, but
is looking for a job elsewhere. She has a degree in MLS.</P>

<P><B>Gurnek Singh, Syracuse University</B>: Nothing new to report.
After three years, they have a new university librarian. They need to
send more material to off-site storage as they have run out of space.
Gurnek visited India last year.</P>

<P><B>Avinash Maheshwary, Duke University</B>: All four universities are
still part of the TRLL program. Only NC Central will be an associate
partner. NC State has moved more towards technical subjects in
agriculture and textiles etc. So, Duke and UNC have cut back in those
areas. Duke library has moved into a new building. There a new two new
vacancies for a Latin American and a Slavic librarian. Recently
completed a bar coding project that involved 500,000 books. Most have
been sent to the new state-of-the-art off-site storage facility. A new
Institute of Islamic Studies has been formed on campus.  </P>

<P><B>Qunying Li, Arizona State University</B>: The library allotted
$5000 for the first time for acquisition for South Asia studies.
Hopefully, they will give more next year.  </P>

<P><B>Allen Thrasher and Nuzhat Khatoon, Library Of Congress</B>: The
threat of the Area Studies Reading Room being appropriated for
exhibition space has been averted. It is also unlikely that the four
reading rooms will be amalgamated. The acquisitions budget for Asia is
good, but might face another cut next year. There is now a permanent
head for the reference services of the Asia Division. There are vacant
posts in the Chinese and SEA sections. The Reading Room also is
understaffed.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big British
Intelligence files will become available soon. Catching up on
continental prints. There is a lot of translation into French. Sending
as much as can to off-site storage and retaining only microfilms and
reference materials. Visitors beware, make requests before coming.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LC acquired two new
collections of Burmese documents. These include the archives captured by
General Stillwell and the interrogation records of communist insurgents
after the War in Burma. Both have lots of stuff on Indians in Burma. IDC
will film them both. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is continuing on
cataloging Bengali manuscripts, and Rukhsana will start work on Urdu
manuscripts. Catching up on fiche and newspapers on microfilm.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Friend's Society of
the Asia Division is active and has got a $300,000 donation which will
go towards acquisition and cataloging. Want to make big push on US South
Asia publications via copyright law. Will try to acquire diaspora
publications at book fair in Frankfurt.</P>

<P><B>Adnan Malik, University of California, Berkeley</B>: Adnan is the
new South Asia librarian at UCB. </P>

<P><B>Bronwen Bledsoe, Cornell University</B>: Bronwen is the new South
Asia Curator at Cornell.</P>

<P><B>James Nye, University of Chicago</B>: Gerry Hall has taken over
some of Bronwen's responsibilities. Eventually, Catherine Adcock will
replace Bronwen.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new extension is being
built for the Regenstein Library. Helmut Jahn will be its architect, and
it is expected to open in four years.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr R.C. Dhere's (?)
Marathi collection will be purchased in Pune and will stay there. Jim
will work on the collection with the help of AIIS. Others are welcome to
join. </P>

<P><B>James Simon, CRL</B>: The cataloging of foreign doctoral
dissertations continues.  Lost their South Asia catalogers and do not
have much SA staff, mostly part time workers.
 </P>

<P><B>David Magier, Columbia University</B>: These are boom times for
Area Studies and South Asia at Columbia with new faculty hires. Partha
Chatterjee is the director of Center for Mid East and Asia. Sheldon
Pollock is there. There is money for hiring Area Studies faculty in all
departments. South Asia has increased budget to spend on serials, books
etc.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a vast
and rapid growth in off-site storage. Facilities shared by Columbia,
Princeton and NYPL. They are working on #5 and planning #6 and will
start sending stuff off-site on receipt, making it the default
location.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just received donation
of Howard Riggins' (?) ambassadorial documents and the musicology
collection of Harold Powers.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new program for
digitization has been started where each division, including Area
Studies, will have individual selectors select digitization targets.
They are limited by copyright. South Asia will get to do significant
digitization.</P>

<P><B>Mary Rader, University of Wisconsin, Madison</B>: A number of
faculty got stolen.  There is a lot of construction, including new
storage facility. Retirements will cause delays in cataloging.</P>
