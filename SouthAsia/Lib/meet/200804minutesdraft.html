        <p><b>The meeting started at 1:20 p.m.</b></p>

        <p><a name="intro"><b>1. Introduction</b><br />
</a> Chair Tim Bryson welcomed attendees to Emory, and called for new agenda items.<br />
Andrea Singer requested that a place for general announcements be added at the end of the 
agenda: 11. <a href="#general">General Announcements.</a>

<p><a href="#attendees"><b>Attendees (listed below):</b></a>

Don Johnson (Minnesota) and Gurnek Singh (Syracuse), after Gurnek introduced his successor, 
Uma Sharma.  Tim also announced that David Magier has moved to Princeton, and does not know how i
nvolved he will remain in South Asian activities. However David will serve one more year on 
AAS's SAC (South Asian Council). (The group plans to honor Don and Gurnek, and send David 
off with our best wishes this evening at dinner at the Haveli Restaurant.)</p>

        <p><a name="review" id="review"></a><b>2.Report of Last Meeting's Minutes</b><br />
The draft minutes of the Fall 2007 meeting in Madison were approved as written, and can be given final 
status on the CONSALD web site: <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/consald.html" 
target="_blank">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/consald.html</a></p>

<p><b>3. Report of the Chair &amp; Treasurer’s Report</b><br />

Having welcomed, all, Tim deferred to Andrea for the Treasurer's report. She reported that the 
balance in the treasury after honoring retirees is $499.90. She asked whether we wish to continue 
the discussion of charging dues, which we began in Madison. <br />
Philip said that we may need to consider dues if changes to the website including a separate URL 
occur. James Gentner mentioned that MELA  (Middle East Librarians Association) does have dues, and, 
through an endowment, offers travel stipends to students.

Tim thanked Merry Burlingham and Philip McEldowney for their service on the Executive Committee 
(2006-2008), and thanked Jeff Martin and Liladhar Pendse for their willingness to stand for 
election for one open librarian position on the committee for a two year term. Members of the 
group cast ballots and Merry Burlingham counted votes. (Later in the meeting Tim announced that 
Liladhar was elected, and suggested a short meeting of the Executive Committee immediately 
following the meeting.)</p>

Modeling:</b><br />

Philip acknowledged the web site committee: Sunita Vaze, Carol Mitchell, David Nelson, and himself, 
and suggested that he put up a draft site in time for the fall meeting in Madison. The committee 
has discussed this rather complicated ongoing project as a possible information source for a wider 
audience without duplicating SARAI (South Asia Resource Access on the Internet) 
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/" target="_blank">
http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/ </a>.<br />
Other ideas include making an open area as well as a password protected area. 
CORMOSEA and MELA pages were viewed, and alternatives such as WIKIs, Facebook, 
and others were discussed. Philip suggested that people contact him with suggestions 
including whether to plan to keep the site at the University of Virginia, or move. 
Avinash Maheshwary suggested that readability might be achieved by short line lengths 
and a simple format.</p>

        <p><b>6. AAMES (Asian, African, and Middle Eastern Section) of ACRL Rajwant 
Chilana</b> directed the group to the AAMES web site at <a href="http://www.ala.org/aames" target="_blank">
http://www.ala.org/aames</a>  and described this active committee of the American Library 
Association's Association of College and Research Libraries. He indicated that the group 
invites participation on five committees, and will be sponsoring programs at this summer's 
ALA meeting. Deepa Banerjee will be a speaker there.</p>

        <p> <a href="#top"><img alt="Back to the top" src="20071011minutes_files/top20.htm" align="right" 
border="0" height="20" width="39"></a> <a name="coop" id="coop"></a> <b>7. DSAL Update</b><br />

<b>Jerry Hall </b>reported that gramophone recordings from the <i>Linguistic Survey of India</i> DSAL 
project are almost ready for use, as well as some from the <i>Linguistic Survey of Burma.</i> The 
project has three aspects including audio and transcription, full text volumes, and maps from the 
<i>Linguistic Survey</i>, which locate the person narrating.  (There are 242 phonographic transcriptions 
from the British Library.)<br />
<b>Jim Nye</b> reported that the South Asia Union Catalog (SAUC) completed its sixth training session 
for catalogers, this one held in Kathmandu, and has become the fourth highest contributor of unique 
records to WorldCat. The project is beginning data keying by contractors to retrospectively convert 
<i>Quarterly Lists</i> as a way to facilitate on-going work by catalogers. (<i>Quarterly Lists</i> 
are lists of books published regionally --Punjab, Bengal, etc.-- as supplements to the <i>Government 
Gazettes</i>.) The lists include basic bibliographic information as well as copyright holder, 
publisher, and number of copies published.<br />

<b>Bronwen Bledsoe </b>asked a question about the search interface, and Jim said a major revamping 
is underway to make the search more like WorldCat, with an advanced search as well.<br />
Contracts for new dictionary projects have been signed for several languages and the goal is to 
have one dictionary per language in the vernacular and one from the vernacular to English. Perso-Arabic 
has been added to Platts. (See <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/" target="_blank">
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/</a>)
Tim indicated astonishment at the amount of material being digitized.
</p>

        <p> <a name="crl"></a> <br>8. CRL E-books</b><br />
<b>Judy Alspach</b> announced that patron requests at CRL (the Center for Research Libraries) 
are driving scanning (700,000 yearly scans). Depending on factors relating to the request (
size, number of reels, etc.) a scan might be supplied instead of film. Items being scanned now 
are made searchable through OCR, but older items are not internally searchable.  See the 
eResources tab in the CRL catalog at CRL: <a href="http://www.crl.edu" target="_blank">
http://www.crl.edu</a><br />

See also the CRL web site at: <a href="http://www.crl.edu/content.asp?l1=5&l2=22&l3=39&top=49" 
target="_blank">http://www.crl.edu/content.asp?l1=5&l2=22&l3=39&top=49</a> under "Indian 
Uprising of 1857 Resources" for a group of resources related to the Sepoy Mutiny, which were 
scanned at the request of Liberal Arts Interest Group member, Vassar College. (These materials 
are vetted to see if they have already been scanned elsewhere.)
</p>

<p><b>NOTE: A short break was held, and the meeting resumed at 3:20, when the election results 
were announced. (<a href="#elect">See 4.</a>)</b></p>

align="right" border="0" height="20" width="39"></a> <a name="ccdev"></a><b>9. Cooperative 
Collection Development</b><br />

Background documents for this discussion are at:<br />
 <a href="http://www.library.wisc.edu/guides/SoAsia/cooperation.htm" target="_blank">
http://www.library.wisc.edu/guides/SoAsia/cooperation.htm</a><br />
<b>Mary Rader and Bronwen Bledsoe</b> discussed the "National Cooperative Collections 
for South Asian Studies Wisconsin-Cornell Pilot", which they have initiated  this year. 
The essence of the cooperative agreement is that Wisconsin will embark on a new collection 
focus in South Asian theatre, while Cornell will pursue Himalayan materials, especially 
those from Nepal. Both collections will circulate through interlibrary loan .  (Wisconsin 
will retain older Nepali language materials, while Cornell will develop future holdings, 
for example.)<br />
The group was enthusiastic in discussing this pilot in cooperative collecting, which meets
 the changing needs of both institutions, and was approved at the CEO level at both universities. 
At Wisconsin statistics on use in relation to bindery costs were useful in the internal discussion.  
Mary and Bronwen discussed further details and invited those interested in continuing discussion 
at this time to join them in a lunchtime meeting on April 4th.<br />
Other topics of cooperation were discussed, including which varieties of research materials people 
are willing to wait to receive, the character of "Rapid ILL" for document delivery, and the future 
(or not) of regional cooperative groups such as SAC West.  (Adnan Malik indicated that Berkeley is 
interested in keeping SACWest alive.)</p>

        <p> <a name="lccap"></a> <b>10. LCCAP Update</b>

<b>James Gentner</b> announced that retired LC librarian Alice Kniskern's mother passed away, 
and he would share addresses privately with anyone who wished to write to Alice.<br />
<i><b>Responses to the Future of Bibliographic Control </b></i>report, 
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/bibliographic-future/" target="_blank">http://www.loc.gov/bibliographic-future/</a> 
will be disseminated before the ALA meeting.<br />
The Library of Congress is facing a bad budget situation. Budget requests are at the same level as 
last year, but cost of living raises and salaries have gone up. The plan is to keep everyone on staff, 
but do no traveling for the rest of the fiscal year. There is a cost-sharing program to secure embassies 
around the world, and the assessment is based on the number of employees, so those costs are also  
substantial.<br />
<b>Carol Mitchell</b> said the Islamabad program wishes to build better profiles rather than 
relying on circulars. There is less publishing as NGOs leave. Staff changes include retirement, 
reassignment, and buying trips by bibliographic representatives. Catalogers received training 
with Sunita's help.<br />
<b>Laila Mulgaokar</b> described developments in the Indian publishing scene including art catalogs, 
for which a new profile will be added. Discussion ranged broadly, and Laila suggested people send her 
follow-up e-mails about their specific suggestions, which included a call for more Shiite material, 
regional films for India, and circulars for Routledge, Sage, and Oxford titles. Laila also asked for 
suggestions if U.S. participants are developing good contacts for specific types of materials. <br />

<b>Laila said</b> that an empty position for a Bangladesh representative will be filled, and that 
they are using a new Tamil book dealer in Columbo. This year 50% of acquisitions trips were accomplished.<br />
Regarding <b>SACAP payments</b>, James said that when the available balance reaches 20%, the New 
Delhi office informs Washington that funds are running low. Participants are then asked to deposit 
additional funds. (E-mails should go to billing person and bibliographer.)  If no funds are 
deposited, monographs are cut off. The participant will receive an e-mail the day the monographs 
are cut off. In general most participants have some carryover, but five participants were stopped 
for six weeks this year.<br />
<b>James</b> said the Nairobi office is now sending electronic rather than paper bills, and asks if 
that can work in SACAP libraries. (This can be a topic of conversation at the Madison meeting, which 
Fehl Cannon will probably attend.)</p>

<p><a name="general"></a><b>11.	General Announcements</b><br />
Andrea announced that copies of Rebecca Manring's guide to the Sukumar 
Sen Manuscript Collection, which was filmed as a SAMP project, are available to librarians at 
the AAS booth in the conference exhibit area. </p>

<p>The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>
