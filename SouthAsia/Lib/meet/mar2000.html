<b>II. LC-New Delhi Report</b>

<p><b>Carol Mitchell </b>reported on the following:

<ul><li>
Lygia Ballantyne has gone to Mongolia and has hired a representative there. 
So far, things are going well. Shipments have been made from Mongolia.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Regular acquisitions trips are undertaken by the selection officers in
the Delhi Office, including recent trips to Rajasthan.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Carol discussed the selection profiles. If anyone is receiving too many 
titles, they should re-evaluate the selective vs. representative categories. 
It was noted that selective books do cost more. She suggested that perhaps 
there needs to be refinement in the language profiles. For example, should 
literary criticism be divided into two levels? Should social sciences be 
broken down further? In addition, should there be more refinement in the 
English language profiles? Some discussion ensued: 1) David Magier wondered 
whether the language profiles should be refined or if there should be an 
option for separating selective, representative, etc. for the languages; 
2) Merry Burlingham said that faculty are asking for more discrimination 
(levels) in the language profiles, particularly for cost saving; 3) Mel 
Thatcher thought that if there was a more refined list one could make more 
specific choices in the languages and that this would benefit those who 
don't have full language representation in the profiles, etc. After discussion, 
Carol said she would make a proposal to LC for more refinement in the profiles.</li> 

<li>
Regarding rejections, the Delhi Office can tell you what was rejected in 
a particular profile and why.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
The Delhi Office welcomes more feedback from participants, either directly 
or through responses to the circulars. Some discussion regarding the circulars 
ensued. Currently, the circulars are sent out for anything over $50. Suzanne 
McMahon asserted that the circulars are helpful.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The Delhi Office is seeing more and more non-print materials these days, 
particularly GIS, maps and other by-products of larger GIS projects. In 
general, these are expensive items. Some discussion: 1) David Magier asked 
if LC would ask vendors/publishers of these materials about consortial 
purchase possibilities; that is, can LC work out joint licensing agreements? 
2) Philip McEldowney wondered about the networking possibilities for such 
items; 3) Carol Mitchell responded that more networking/cooperative purchasing 
agreements may come in the future but right now, the majority of things 
are coming out on CD which are difficult to acquire consortially; she is 
encouraging web-based products in India; 4) Ved Kayastha asked about how 
to purchase map like products—does one have to buy the whole package, or 
can one purchase parts, etc.; 5) David Magier wondered again about the 
possibility of consortial possibilities for these large map purchases.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Carol reported that instead of DVDs, VCDs are what's being produced in 
India these days. She asked whether people would be interested in them 
and said that they could buy samples and then ascertain their usefulness. 
Some discussion: 1) Allen Thrasher said that Ron Inden has been talking 
about the prevalence of VCDs over video; 2) Monica Ghosh wondered what 
the technical requirements of the VCD would be -- can we view them on a computer 
or a DVD player? 3) Ved Kayastha said he would accept some VCDs to test 
in the DVD players he has; 4) Carol told of old movies being put onto DVD 
in London.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Carol talked of a proposal to change the content and/or add content to 
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/">the LC webpage</a>. 
The changes might contain space for current lists of receipts, 
serial lists, financial spreadsheets, etc. There is currently no timeline 
for such a webpage, this discussion was preliminary to a proposal. David 
Magier wondered if LC could put the serials list on this website instead 
of having it on the U of Chicago server. Carol said that there would be 
no serials list sent on disk this year. It was noted that last year's serials 
list has yet to make it onto the Chicago page. Information on serials seems 
to be a priority for this website. Philip McEldowney said it would be helpful 
to have monographic information also on this website -- for example, which 
titles acquired by LC, which participant they're going to, etc. He asserted
that we need more timely information on selections made in Delhi. Carol 
said that email works well for this type of information exchange, but by 
mounting acquisitions data in web format, participants will get the information 
themselves. David Magier thinks that we should have some data field showing 
where within the profile certain titles fall. Bibliographic data also seems
a priority more than information regarding cost, etc. Perhaps LC could 
put some information regarding rejections into a field. Mel Thatcher wondered 
if the profiles could be put on the site with the availability to adjust 
one's profile. David Magier thought that it would be helpful to see an 
interface between the profile and the bills on the site. Participants could 
search by their number or a specific profile number. The database will 
include information on selected and rejected titles. Carol responded that 
it would be helpful if one could generate reports from the site. In sum, 
the priorities for the proposal seemed to be: serials, monographs, and 
profile displays with options for changing them.&nbsp;</li> 

<li> Carol reported on the Integrated Field Office System (IFOS), the
replacement of the Integrated Order, Distribution and Acounting system
(IODA). This intent is to be more transparent than IODA. There is a
better cataloging turnaround time using this -- dealers are doing the
initial bibliographic inputting. There are some workflow problems,
particularly with serials. Serials unit is clearing up backlogs,
however. It is hoped that reports in the future will be more flexible as
to the data the Office is able to generate.</li>

<li>
Regarding serials, Carol says that the Delhi office is up to date on electronic 
claims. She repeats that there will not be a serials list diskette this 
year. Chicago needs to be urged to get last year's data onto the website 
maintained there. The Office plans to have a serials database on the web 
would be much more dynamic than the disks.</li>

<li>
Regarding cataloging, the Delhi office has hired three new staff members 
responsible for the following languages: Oriya, Bengali, and Telugu.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The quarterly and annual budget reports will continue. The quarterly reports 
have about a one month lag time and the yearly reports are based on LC's 
fiscal year. Ray Lum asked if we could pay LC electronically/using a credit 
card. James Gentner doesn’t see why we couldn't but he will check on it 
and let us know.&nbsp;<a name="overview"></a></li>

<li>
Carol has made <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/cost.html">a 
study on the cost of books</a> through the LC program. 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/cost.html">This 
report will be put on the web</a> by Philip McEldowney. In brief, the cost 
of books has not gone up since 1996, due to the parallel rises in inflation
and the valuation of the dollar. Some average costs:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>English title=$8.80
<br>Humanities title=$11.00 (includes art books)
<br>Business/economics title=$6.64
<br>Religion title=$4.95
<br>Literature title=$3.60
<br>Hindi title=$4.79
<br>Hindi literary criticism=$2.47
<br>Bengali title=$1.34
<br>English title from Nepal=$4.13 (the price increase resulting from better 
selection) 
<br>English title from Bangladesh=$6.01
<br>Sri Lankan English title=$4.40&nbsp;</blockquote> 
Carol gave examples of how LC gets bargains compared to other dealers. 
Irene asked if the LC overhead was included in the figures mentioned and 
Carol responded that it wasn't but that in many cases LC received significant 
discounts that made up for differences in overhead, for example the English 
language discount offered to LC is 26% which equals out the overhead costs.</blockquote>

<ul><li>
The MIPP project has been suspended by the Indian Government. The GOI says 
they will do the project themselves. Irene Joshi wondered at which point 
it had been suspended. <i>Carol says it ended in Calcutta  
and that the project will finish up by the 
end of April when LC completes filming in Alighar.</i> Although the project 
is suspended, the cameras are still there and we are allowed to film so 
they are looking for some new filming projects. Overall, we need to regroup 
and reprioritize.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Regarding shipments, Carol reminded us that LC will not ship without money 
in the shipment deposit fund and that they will not shift funds from category 
to category without permission. They will airmail items if requested; participants 
were reminded that this would deplete their shipping funds and may lead 
to supplemental bills. They are not going to ship two slips with the books 
anymore. They will go down to one slip and then eventually go exclusively 
to labels instead of slips. Merry Burlingham wondered if this would increase 
the label size, etc. but Carol assured that the size would not increase, 
just the amount of bibliographic information on the slip. So, there will
be slips in the preshipment and then just the labels with the books. Philip 
McEldowney wondered if the pre-shipment could be sent electronically. In 
the future, this will be a part of the Office's web pages.</li> 

<li> 
James Gentner announced that starting April 3<sup>rd</sup> there will only 
be MLC for belle letters from India. From now on, participant libraries 
will have to cutter belle letters themselves. David Magier asked if we 
could get a formal memo on this new procedure to forward on to our respective 
cataloging departments, etc.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
During the New Delhi Book Fair, country representatives from Bangladesh, 
Mongolia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka attended a Conference at the Office. There 
was a good exchange between the folks making selections and LC reps regarding 
information about the recipient libraries, etc.. They also used the Book 
Fair to compare vendors' work with what's available generally.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
The Delhi office has some new automation staff.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
The Office continues to seek ways to improve communication between the 
Delhi staff and the participants. She says that there's already good communication 
between Delhi and the other field offices.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
The proposed field office internships did not get any funding. It was reminded 
that there are LC fellowships generally. Some discussion: 1) Ved Kayastha 
wondered why no one from the Delhi Field Office was visiting the U.S.; 
2) Judy McDermott said she would look into it as they already do that for 
the other field offices; 3) Carol said to make sure to meet with folks 
when coming through Delhi; 4) Irene Joshi suggested that it would be best 
to have them (FSN staff) come to Madison, not to the AAS.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Ved Kayastha said that he would like to see circulars for Sage publications 
like those coming for OUP. Carol responded that they can purchase from 
specific publishers, even above/beyond profile (that is, all OUP or all 
Sage publications, regardless of one's profile).</li>

<b>III. LC-Pakistan Report</b> 
<p><b>Jim Armstrong</b> reported on the following:&nbsp; 

<ul><li>
Jim talked about the state of the State of Pakistan. He says that there 
has been increased security in Pakistan in recent months.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
The IFOS program is in use in the Islamabad office, but it is not as advanced 
as the one in Delhi.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The change in government has had little effect on publishing in Pakistan -- publishers 
and authors continue to self-censor rather than face government censorship. 
Jim said he was unable to point out secular publishing trends. He feels 
that the overall publishing environment in Pakistan is quite stagnant. 
In addition, the distribution between cities in Pakistan is poor, etc.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Although the Islamabad office has been making approximately 10-12 acquisitions 
trips a year, they continue to depend on book dealers throughout the country 
with whom they have blanket orders.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The Islamabad office has been trying to do some retrospective purchasing 
in Afghanistan over the last four years. This is a difficult venture -- they 
have to smuggle the books into Peshwar, sometimes they're discovered and
the books are destroyed, etc. Jim also reiterated that the Taliban is quite 
averse to any book publishing.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
In regard to Iran, the office has a dealer in Dubai who makes direct shipments 
to the office.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The office has been doing some exchange of materials in Central Asia but 
these ventures are "dependant on the diplomatic pouch."&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The IFOS system has slowed the ordering process in Islamabad.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The cataloging in Islamabad is a slower rate than last year.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Jim hasn't seen electronic documents and/or software being produced in 
Pakistan, although there is a big pirated market for goods primarily from 
Singapore. This pirated stuff has proved to be a big problem including 
materials from OUP, etc.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Official publishing in Pakistan is showing a decline except for the census 
which is bringing out district level reports (over 155 of them). LC is 
routinely getting multiple copies of these reports.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Jim generally lamented the retrograde state of publishing in Pakistan.&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
Some discussion followed Jim's presentation: 1) Ved Kayastha said he would 
like to see more division in the religion profile from Pakistan, that is, 
he would like to see a division between Islam in general and Islam in South 
Asia, etc.; 2) David Magier asked if academic publishing in Pakistan was 
also on the decline to which Jim answered yes—he feels that the academic 
stuff is subpar, etc.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Jim welcomes any feedback from participants.</li>

<b>IV. Newspaper List</b>

<p>Irene Joshi didn't have much to report on the status of the Newspaper 
List as it has been out of her hands for the past one and a half years. 
She's going to explore other venues for it before she retires. If all else 
fails, she will put it up as a text file only on the web. Some discussion 
ensued about who might continue and maintain what Irene has developed. 
David Magier said that DSAL might pick it up; James Simon said that perhaps 
CRL could devote resources to it as well.&nbsp;<a name="salnaq"></a>

<b>V. 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/salnaq/">SALNAQ</a></b>

<p>It was reported that David Nelson is no longer in charge of SALNAQ. 
Philip McEldowney and Alan Grosenheider will co-edit the online version. 
Philip wondered how SALNAQ should continue? He suggests articles, minutes 
of meetings (SAMP and CONSALD), questions and answers regarding bibliographic 
questions, etc. Alan said that there is a possibility of incorporating 
CONSALD reference questions on SALNAQ, that there is an archiving possibility 
and that reviews of reference materials might be included in SALNAQ. Suzanne 
McMahon said that minutes from meetings should go to the respective pages 
(CONSALD, SAMP, etc) and that we might include project proposals, faculty 
research briefs, etc. Other suggestions were trip reports, translations, 
lists of notable titles outside of LCCAP, etc. Some discussion about the 
periodicity followed -- should it be twice a year? Annual? Ongoing? Some further 
discussion: 1) Carol Mitchell thinks we need to have publishing deadlines 
in order to get submissions; 2) David Magier wondered how we would get 
people to participate -- would this be the responsibility of the editor?; 
3) Philip wondered how much editing the editors should do; 4) David thinks 
we should try to include the larger community, not just CONSALD members; 
5) Amy Wells thinks we need to define what will appear and when up front 
and that perhaps we should time submissions around conferences; 6) Irene 
wonders if we could link up with SALG and others.&nbsp;<a name="dalr"></a>

<b>VI. DAL Report</b>

<p>Amy Wells, the project manager for the DAL project reported on its status. 
The DAL is a three-year Department of Education funded program to identify 
and catalog digital resources related to Asia. There are four subject specialists/selectors 
for each of the areas, including Carol Mitchell for SE Asia and Don Johnson 
for South Asia (others for Japan and China). So far, the DAL has been developing 
its infrastructure. For example, they are using the Dublin Core standard, 
some of the MARC codes, and will use the OCLC site search. They are not 
digitizing resources but are working on ways to identify them. There will
be some standardizations regarding priority for identifying resources across 
the subject categories. <i>Phase two of the project will create an international 
scholarly journal.</i> Amy used to work on the "Scout Report" 
[<a href="http://www.scout.cs.wisc.edu">http://www.scout.cs.wisc.edu</a>] 
and the format from this project may carry 
over into DAL. The final phase of the project will be a database of free 
electronic resources specific to Asia. Some discussion: 1) Irene Joshi 
said that if the selectors were not finding sources, this fact also needs 
to get public exposure (which could lead to more cooperation, more impetus 
for resource creation, etc.); she also asked how they would maintain the 
database for long-term use to which Amy replied that they will incorporate 
two fields (date of review and date link last verified) to try to address 
maintenance; 2) Mel asked about how to give feedback which Amy replied 
was built into the system; 3) Monica Ghosh wondered how the areas would 
be divided out (in terms of percentages, etc) to which Amy replied each 
selector was expected to identify a certain number of resources a month; 
4) Merry Burlingham wondered about non-roman issues to which both Carol 
and Amy said there will be no language restrictions but in some cases the 
end-user will have to have his/her own plug-ins, etc.&nbsp;<a name="dsal"></a></li>

<b>VII. DSAL Report</b> 

<p>David Magier reported on the DSAL project. He distributed a handout 
which outlines the major sub-projects of DSAL. He explained that the DSAL 
will encompass a broad continuum of projects and participants, from institutions 
with their own funding and resources but without server space to those 
creating new digital resources. The DSAL is housed and under the administration 
of CRL and it's new project manager is Rebecca Moore. DSAL has purchased 
a 35-gigabyte drive server so they don't anticipate any limitations on 
the server space necessitated by the project. David gave explained the 
handout further: 

<ol><li>
full text resources&nbsp;</li>

<li>
pedagogical resources -- these are mostly geared towards language instruction&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
Official Publications of India -- they have started with the 24,000 pre-Independence 
titles indentified by Sims but will add in a database of post-Independence 
documents to be created by Oxford&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
in the case of scanning, they will do it from the film]&nbsp;</li>

<li>
statistical data -- they may get permission to re-publish stuff published
by the GOI&nbsp;</li>

<li>
cartographic materials -- this will include maps from the British Library;
an index to the India Office "Y" class maps; they are using "Mr. CID"&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Mr. Syd?] software for high-resolution, navigatable maps&nbsp;</li>

<li>
photo archives -- of the 250,000 photos from the BL, 80,000 from the Survey 
of India will be digitized; 10,000 photos from CSSC in Calcutta; photos 
from a Jesuit archive in Tamilnadu; the AIIS photo archive (125,000+ images)&nbsp;</li> 

<li>
periodical indexing -- this has already started and is progressing smoothly. 
The English records are going into the BAS and David gave the aside that 
the vernacular record will eventually also go into the BAS</li> 
</ol>

The Dictionaries Project will also have Rebecca Moore as its program manager. 
<p>The urls for the projects are:

<p><font size=+0>James Simon pointed out that all the DSAL information 
would eventually migrate to the server at CRL.&nbsp;</font> 

<p><font size=+0>There will be a "major publicity event" after more input 
and production in order to get more people involved and aware of the project.&nbsp;</font> 

<p><font size=+0>There was a question about where SAMP might fit into the 
DSAL project to which David suggested that DSAL could work in collaboration 
within the greater SAMP project.&nbsp;</font><a name="robin"></a>

<b>VIII. Round Robin</b></font> 

<ul><li>
<font size=+0>James Simon reminded us of the SAMP meeting on the 10<sup>th</sup>.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Allen Thrasher reported that the new library technician (who 
had retired from LC-Delhi) was working out well. He says they have caught 
up with their shelving at LC. He reports that the South Asian language 
MLC will be the first stuff to go to the remote storage module. LC has 
just ordered the IDC census and gazetteer films. They have acquired a number 
of Urdu manuscripts from a private source. The ILS is now up and working 
although there is no news on the vernacular capability of the new system.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Ray Lum reported that Harvard has acquired the Daniel Engels 
collection.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li> 
<font size=+0>Mel Thatcher reported that the Genealogical Society is filming 
the civil registration for Indians in South Africa (they’re already done 
this for Figi).&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Monica Ghosh reported that Hawaii's Southeast Asia librarian 
has retired and that they're looking for applicants.&nbsp;</font></li>
