of retirees Krishan Khera and Lynette Wagemann are
being prepared.</LI></UL>

<UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI><I>Evacuation</I>. Armstrong
return for several months.  Meanwhile, Rukhsana Saood, the
Acting In Charge of the office, will continue to monitor
emails and faxes on a daily basis. Any special requests can
be emailed direct to Rukhsana at </FONT><A

SIZE="">rsao@loc.gov</FONT></A></LI>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI><I>Shipments</I>. There were
no shipments from Islamabad for a couple of weeks following
Sept. 11. This was due to interruptions in the scheduled PIA
flights which carry the APO mail, and secondarily to the
lack of suitable mail bags caused by the absence of incoming
flights. Shipments resumed after about 3 weeks.</LI>

<LI><I>Staff</I>.  Current staff has 22 members, mostly from
Karachi and the province of Sindh. Eight people retired last
year which means we have many new staff members, brining
with them more energy and stability.  All of them were
Punjabis, bringing more diversity. Hiring a new agent for
Karachi has been problematic but it has resulted in renewed
contacts with local dealers.</LI>

<LI><I>Titles.</I> There was a large increase in the number of titles
received, in part due to the education of authors into the advantages of
copyright protection.</LI>

<LI><I>Cataloging.</I> This was the best year for cataloging.</LI>

<LI><I>OUP</I>. OUP contacts improved, which should expedite processing
and delivery of their titles.</LI>

<LI><I>Afghani materials</I>. There were significant purchases of older
titles, most of which were sent to New Delhi for micofilming.</LI>

<LI><I>Radical Islamic materials</I>. One staff member, a woman, has
been courageous and resourceful in acquiring radical Islamic materials,
including Taliban publications from Quetta and cassette recordings of
speeches.</LI>

<LI>Third Quarter Financial Reports are coming.</LI>

<LI>Questions/Comments</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Q:Has quality improved as well as quantity? A: No </LI>

<LI>Q: Are you selecting out materials that address general Islamic
issues without any local relevance? A: Yes.  It is a judgement call and
we keep titles that have any local material in them.</LI>

<LI>Q: What is the proportion of Urdu to English? A: About
900::500.</LI>
<LI>C: Some books on the slips are not arriving. A: Send
info to the office for follow-up.</LI>
<LI>C: OUP/Karachi books on the Taliban and bin Laden are
popular now.</LI>
<LI>C: There is a project to digitize Taliban materials; we
could use more.</LI>
<LI>Q: Are you collecting ephemera like posters? A: Yes;
they are sent to LC.</LI>
<LI>Q: What is LC's plan for distributing these? A: It's
under discussion.</LI>
<LI>Q: How can we access microfilmed items? A: We send them
to New Delhi but after that, they become difficult to
track.</FONT></LI></UL>

<UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI><I> Security concerns</I>.
Generally, India is calm but we are looking at alternative
locations in case of emergency.</LI>
<LI>Acquisitions. </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Another boom year. </LI>
<LI>About 17,000 titles were acquired. </LI>
<LI>More were reviewed and rejected, esp. in the subject
areas of human rights, women's studies, encyclopedias, world
development--because many of these are mere cut-and-paste
copies of earlier works. [Comment: the emails with
explanations of the reasons for rejecting items are very
helpful.]</LI>
<LI>We have been pro-active in acquiring elusive items,
e.g., publications of a banned student Islamic group and
controversial textbooks.  These are assembled into
microfiche sets. Originals are sent to CRS and FRD (Federal
Research Division of LC [they publish the country
studies])</LI>
<LI>Publications from OUP, Viking, Penguin, Sage take
priority.</LI></UL>

<LI>Staff</LI>

<UL>
<LI>There have been new hires in Burma and accounting.</LI>
<LI>Mr. Butani will be retiring next year.</LI></UL>

<LI>Fulbright Program is interested in library
projects.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Working on firewall protection so that participant
reports can be posted</LI>
<LI>Content will include lists of acquisitions trips and
title search feature for microfilmed serials, pamphlets,
etc.</LI>
<LI>Which is more important to post on a monthly basis--
list of titles on order or titles shipped? Comments:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Include info from Islamabad office. </LI>
<LI>Titles shipped will be in OCLC; add 4-5 months to date
of record to estimate date of arrival at participant
libraries.</LI>
<LI>Shipment times vary depending on whether ships take
Pacific route or Atlantic route.</LI>
<LI>Profile info can be searched in OCLC.  </LI>
<LI>If item on order comes with insufficient copies for
participants, it is fiched.</LI>
<LI>Would it be more efficient to address such issues by
individual inquiry? Some people report inadequate
responsiveness. CM: Response should be within 24 hours.
</LI></UL>
</UL>

<LI>Comments/Questions</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Q: Can we have thank you notes for our visits? A: Yes.
</LI>
<LI>Q: Digital products? A: Most are not good; we ask for
demos of each.  DVD's more common format than VCD's. Perhaps
digital map products could be networked among CONSALD
members.</LI>
<LI>C: LC will look at the Rubi Enterprise catalog.</LI>
<LI>Q: Subtitled videos? A: Most come to LC without
subtitles but we will circularize notice of those that do
have subtitles.</LI>
<LI>Q: Move from sewn to adhesive binding so as to avoid
inconvenient reductions of margins? A: CM will look into
it.</FONT></LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI> Asian Division Staff: New
reference librarian/bibliographer was hired for Pakistan,
Bangladesh and Islam in South Asia.</LI>
<LI>Subject Cataloging in New Delhi will be expanded to
cover Social Sciences (H) in addition to classes B, D, and
P. Training begins in January.</LI>
<LI> IT Training is being offered in DC for staff using IFOS
(Integrated Field Office System).  That should make support
and use more sophisticated.  The system combines features
like those of GOBI (Yankee) with those of Voyager.</LI>
<LI>Annual Audit. The auditors will send letters randomly to
members of LCCAP and ask them to verify their confidence in
LCCAP's financial bookkeeping.</LI>
<LI>Indirect and Overhead costs. </LI>

<UL>
<LI>These are high but they could be a lot worse.  Congress
is no longer in the PL480 mindset.  </LI>
<LI>The I&amp;O costs pay for the audit and the
Administrative Working Fund (accounting services) as well as
for services for LCCAP participants in the field offices
that extend beyond the requirements of LC, e.g., staff time,
shipping preparation.  LC covers most of these costs,
including salaries and serials check-in. </LI>
<LI>Proposal. It would make it a lot easier on staff if one
rate were set for all six field offices.  That rate would be
42%.  This is higher than the current 39% rate for LCCAP New
Delhi.</LI>
<LI>Q: What congressional entity oversees LC? A: The Joint
Committee on the Library.</LI>
<LI>Q: Why the fluctuations? A: Changes in currency exchange
rates, staffing, rent, equipment as well as in the accuracy
of annual estimates of costs that serves as the basis of
LCCAP billing.</LI></UL>

<LI>Shipping Security. In light of recent events, people may be
concerned about the security of shipments from South Asia.  LC shipments
are very secure.  They are sealed under LC staff supervision in New
Delhi and opened under LC staff supervision at DC. Ignore the customs
slips; they are only to assist the APO.</LI> <LI>Current SACAP/New Delhi
List has 47 member participants.  Not all of them are represented at
CONSALD meetings because they may represent agricultural or law
libraries or Burma programs and go to other conferences.</LI> <LI>
Itemized Billing is possible if you need to bill other entities within
your institution, e.g., a law school. But this service costs LC
money.</FONT></LI></UL>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI>The subcommittee met earlier
in the day and will continue discussions before submitting
proposals to CONSALD next Spring. </LI>

<UL>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=""><LI>Are monthly reports ok?
[Yes]</LI>
<LI>Imperial Gazetteers: 24 of 25 volumes are online. Maps
are coming.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Q: Some names of places have changed; how will people
find citations? A: Places will have geo-coordinates and
people will be able to use the digital maps to find them.
</LI></UL>

<LI>Q: Are ebook URL's stable? A: Yes, they can be
bookmarked.</LI>
<LI>DSAL resources are being cataloged for entry into OCLC
by CRL.</LI>
<LI>Funding: original funding came from the AAU/ARL Global
Resources Program.  DSAL is in the third year of the three
year grant.  Other CONSALD members are invited to
participate in the next funding proposal.  The deadline is
November 30.  For matching purposes, there is a need for
institutions to contribute human time and/or created
resources.  Contact Jim Nye.</FONT></LI></UL>
