<B>II. LC-New Delhi Report</B>

<P><b>Carol Mitchell </b>reported on the following:

<UL>
<li>Lygia Ballantyne has gone to Mongolia and has hired 
a representative there.  So far, things are going well.  S
hipments have been made from Mongolia.

<li>Travel is being undertaken by folks in the Delhi office, 
including recent trips to Rajasthan.

<li>Carol discussed the selection profiles.  If anyone is 
receiving too many titles, they should re-evaluate the 
selective vs. representative categories.  It was noted that selective books 
do cost more.  She suggested that perhaps there needs 
to be refinement in the language profiles.  For example, 
should literary criticism be divided into two levels?  Should 
social sciences be broken down further?  In addition, should 
there be more refinement in the English language profiles? 
Some discussion ensued: 1) David Magier wondered whether 
the language profiles should be refined or if there should be 
an option for separating selective, representative, etc. for the languages; 
2) Merry Burlingham said that faculty are asking for more discrimination 
(levels) in the language profiles, particularly for cost saving; 
3) Mel Thatcher thought that if there was a more refined list one 
could make more specific choices in the languages and that this 
would benefit those who don�t have full language representation 
in the profiles, etc.  After discussion, Carol said she would make 
a proposal to LC for more refinement in the profiles.

<li>Regarding rejections, the Delhi office will tell you what 
was reject and why if asked.

<li>The Delhi office welcomes more feedback from participants, 
either directly or through responses to the circulars.  Some 
discussion regarding the circulars ensued.  Currently, the 
circulars are sent out for anything over $50.  Suzanne 
McMahon asserted that the circulars are helpful.

<li>The Delhi office is seeing more and more non-print materials these days, particularly GIS, maps and other by-products of larger GIS projects.  In general, these are expensive items.  Some discussion: 1) David Magier asked if LC would ask vendors/publishers of these materials about consortial purchase possibilities; that is, can LC work out joint licensing agreements?  2) Philip McEldowney wondered about the networking possibilities for such items; 3) Carol Mitchell responded that more networking/cooperative purchasing agreements may come in the future but right now, the majority of things are coming out on CD; she is encouraging web-based products in India; 4) Ved Kayastha asked about how to purchase map like products�does one have to buy the whole package, or can one purchase parts, etc.; 5) David Magier wondered again about the possibility of consortial possibilities for these large map purchases.

<li>Carol reported that instead of DVDs, VCDs are what�s 
being produced in India these days.  She asked whether 
people would be interested in them and said that they could buy samples and 
then ascertain their usefulness.  Some discussion: 
1) Allen Thrasher said that Ron Inden has been talking about 
the prevalence of 
VCDs over video; 
2) Monica Ghosh wondered what the technical requirements 
of the VCD would be�can we view them on a 
computer or a DVD player? 
3) Ved Kayastha said he would accept some VCDs 
to test in the DVD players he has; 4) Carol told of 
old movies being put onto DVD in London.

<li>Carol talked of a proposal to change the content and/or 
add content to the LC webpage.  The changes might contain 
space for current lists of receipts, serial lists, financial spreadsheets, etc.   
There is currently no timeline for such a webpage, this discussion was 
preliminary to a proposal.  David Magier wondered if LC could put 
the serials list on this website instead of having it on the U of 
Chicago server.  Carol said that there would be no serials list 
sent on disk this year.  It was noted that last year�s serials list 
has yet to make it onto the Chicago page.  Information on serials 
seems to be a priority for this website.  Philip McEldowney said it 
would be helpful to have monographic information also on this 
website�for example, which titles acquired by LC, which participant 
they�re going to, etc.  He asserted that we need more timely 
information on selections made in Delhi.  Carol said that email 
works well for this type of information exchange.  David Magier 
thinks that we should have some data field showing where within 
the profile certain titles fall.  Bibliographic data also seems a priority 
more than information regarding cost, etc.  Perhaps LC could put 
some information regarding rejections into a field.  Mel Thatcher 
wondered if the profiles could be put on the site with the availability 
to adjust one�s profile.  David Magier thought that it would be helpful 
to see an interface between the profile and the bills on the site.  
Carol responded that it would be helpful if one could generate reports 
from the site.  In sum, the priorities for the proposal seemed to be: 
serials, monographs, and profile displays with options for changing them.

<I><li>Carol reported on the replacement iota (??).  This is more 
transparent than IOTA.  There is a better cataloging turnaround 
time using this�dealers are doing the initial bibliographic inputting.  
There are some workflow problems, particularly with serials.  
Serials unit is clearing up backlogs, however.  The reports in 
the future should be more flexible.
</I>

<li>Regarding serials, Carol says that the Delhi office is up to 
date on electronic claims.  She repeats that there will not be a 
serials list diskette this year.  Chicago needs to be urged to get 
last year�s data onto the website maintained there.  Having the 
serials lists on the web is much more dynamic than the disks.
<li>Regarding cataloging, the Delhi office has hired three new 
staff members responsible for the following languages: Oriya, 
Bengali, and Telugu.

<li>The quarterly and annual budget reports will continue.  
The quarterly reports have about a one month lag time and 
the yearly reports are based on LC�s fiscal year.  Ray Lum 
asked if we could pay LC electronically/using a credit card.  
James Gentner doesn�t see why we couldn�t but he will 
check on it and let us know.

<a name="overview"></a>
<li>Carol has made <a href="cost.html"> a study on the cost of
books</a> through the LC program.  <a href="cost.html"> This
report will be put on the web</a> by Philip McEldowney.  In brief, the
cost of books has not gone up since 1996, due to the parallel rises in
inflation and the valuation of the dollar.  Some average costs: </UL>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<P>English title=$8.80
<br>Humanities title=$11.00 (includes art books)
<br>Business/economics title=$6.64
<br>Religion title=$4.95
<br>Literature title=$3.60
<br>Hindi title=$4.79
<br>Hindi literary criticism=$2.47
<br>Bengali title=$1.34
<br>English title from Nepal=$4.13 (the price increase resulting from better selection)
<br>English title from Bangladesh=$6.01
<br>Sri Lankan English title=$4.40

<P>Carol gave examples of how LC gets bargains compared 
to other dealers.  Irene asked if the LC overhead was included 
in the figures mentioned and Carol responded that it wasn�t but 
that the English language discount offered to LC is 26% which 
equals out the overhead costs.</blockquote></blockquote>

<UL>
<li>The MIPP project has been suspended by the Indian 
Government.  The GOI says they will do the project themselves.  
Irene Joshi wondered at which point it had been suspended.  
Carol says it ended in Calcutta and that they will finish up by 
the end of April.  Although the project is suspended, the 
cameras are still there and we are allowed to film so they 
are looking for some new filming projects.  Overall, we need to regroup and reprioritize.

<li>Regarding shipments, Carol reminded us that LC will not 
ship without money in the shipment deposit fund and that 
they will not shift funds from category to category without 
permission.  They will airmail items if requested, but that 
may lead to supplemental bills.  They are not going to 
ship two slips with the books anymore.  They will go 
down to one slip and then eventually go exclusively to 
labels instead of slips.  Merry Burlingham wondered if this 
would increase the label size, etc. but Carol assured that 
the size would not increase, just the amount of bibliographic 
information on the slip.  So, there will be slips in the preshipment 
and then just the labels with the books.  Philip McEldowney 
wondered if the pre-shipment could be sent electronically.

<li>James Gentner announced that starting April 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 
there will only be MLC for belle letters from India.  From now on, 
participant libraries will have to cutter belle letters themselves.  
David Magier asked if we could get a formal memo on this new 
procedure to forward on to our respective cataloging departments, etc.

<li>At the Book Fair in New Delhi, there was an exchange between 
the folks making selections and LC reps regarding information 
about the recipient libraries, etc.  Carol is happy with the selectors.  
They also used the Book Fair to compare vendors� work with what�s 
available generally.

<li>The Delhi office has some new automation staff.

<li>Carol would like to see better communication between the Delhi 
office staff and the participants.  She says that there�s already good 
communication between Delhi and the other field offices.

<li>The proposed field office internships did not get any funding.  
It was reminded that there are LC fellowships generally.  Some discussion: 
1) Ved Kayastha wondered why no one from the Delhi Field Office was visiting the U.S.; 
2) Judy McDermott said she would look into it as they already do that for the other field offices; 
3) Carol said to make sure to meet with folks when coming through Delhi; 
4) Irene Joshi suggested that it would be best to have them come to Madison, 
not to the AAS.

<li>Ved Kayastha said that he would like to see circulars for 
Sage publications like those coming for OUP.  Carol responded 
that they can purchase from specific publishers, even above/beyond 
profile (that is, all OUP or all Sage publications, regardless of one�s profile).</UL>

<B>III.  LC-Pakistan Report</B>

<P><b>Jim Armstrong</b> reported on the following:

<UL>
<li>Jim talked about the state of the State of Pakistan.  
He says that there has been increased security in Pakistan in recent months.

<li>The IFOS program is in use in the Islamabad office, 
but it is not as advanced as the one in Delhi.

<li>The change in government has had little effect on publishing in 
Pakistan�publishers and authors continue to self-censor rather than 
face government censorship.  Jim said he was unable to point out 
secular publishing trends.  He feels that the overall publishing 
environment in Pakistan is quite stagnant.  In addition, the 
distribution between cities in Pakistan is poor, etc.

<li>Although the Islamabad office has been making approximately 10-12 
acquisitions trips a year, they continue to depend on book dealers 
throughout the country with whom they have blanket orders.

<li>The Islamabad office has been trying to do some retrospective 
purchasing in Afghanistan over the last four years.  This is a 
difficult venture�they have to smuggle the books into Peshwar, 
sometimes they�re discovered and the books are destroyed, etc.  
Jim also reiterated that the Taliban is quite averse to any book publishing.

<li>In regard to Iran, the office has a dealer in Dubai who makes 
direct shipments to the office.

<li>The office has been doing some exchange of materials in Central 
Asia but these ventures are &quot;dependant on the diplomatic pouch.&quot;

<li>The IFOS system has slowed the ordering process in Islamabad.

<li>The cataloging in Islamabad is a slower rate than last year.

<li>Jim hasn�t seen electronic documents and/or software being 
produced in Pakistan, although there is a big pirated market for 
goods primarily from Singapore.  This pirated stuff has proved to 
be a big problem including materials from OUP, etc.

<li>Official publishing in Pakistan is showing a decline except 
for the census which is bringing out district level reports (over 
155 of them).  LC is routinely getting multiple copies of these reports.

<li>Jim generally lamented the retrograde state of publishing in Pakistan.

<li>Some discussion followed Jim�s presentation: 1) Ved Kayastha 
said he would like to see more division in the religion profile from 
Pakistan, that is, he would like to see a division between Islam 
in general and Islam in South Asia, etc.; 2) David Magier asked 
if academic publishing in Pakistan was also on the decline to 
which Jim answered yes�he feels that the academic stuff is subpar, etc.

<li>Jim welcomes any feedback from participants.</UL>

<B>IV.  Newspaper List</B>

<P>Irene Joshi didn�t have much to report on the status of the 
Newspaper List as it has been out of her hands for the past 
one and a half years.  She�s going to explore other venues 
for it before she retires.  If all else fails, she will put it up as 
a text file only on the web.  Some discussion ensued about 
who might continue and maintain what Irene has developed.  
David Magier said that DSAL might pick it up; James Simon 
said that perhaps CRL could devote resources to it as well.

<B>V. SALNAQ</B>

<P>It was reported that David Nelson is no longer in charge 
of SALNAQ.  Philip McEldowney and Alan Grosenheider will 
co-edit the online version.  Philip wondered how SALNAQ 
should continue?  He suggests articles, minutes of meetings 
(SAMP and CONSALD), questions and answers regarding 
bibliographic questions, etc.  Alan said that there is a possibility 
of incorporating CONSALD reference questions on SALNAQ, 
that there is an archiving possibility and that reviews of 
reference materials might be included in SALNAQ.   Suzanne 
McMahon said that minutes from meetings should go to the 
respective pages (CONSALD, SAMP, etc) and that we might 
include project proposals, faculty research briefs, etc.  Other 
suggestions were trip reports, translations, lists of notable 
titles outside of LCCAP, etc.  Some discussion about the 
periodicity followed�should it be twice a year? Annual? 
Ongoing?  Some further discussion: 1) Carol Mitchell thinks 
we need to have publishing deadlines in order to get submissions; 
2) David Magier wondered how we would get people to 
participate�would this be the responsibility of the editor?; 
3) Philip wondered how much editing the editors should do; 
4) David thinks we should try to include the larger community, not just 
CONSALD members; 
5) Amy Wells thinks we need to define what will appear and 
when up front and that perhaps we should time submissions around conferences; 
6) Irene wonders if we could link up with SALG and others.

<B>VI.  DAL Report</B>

<P>Amy Wells, the project manager for the DAL project reported 
on its status.  The DAL is a three-year Department of Education 
funded program to identify and catalog digital resources related 
to Asia.  There are four subject specialists/selectors for each 
of the areas, including Carol Mitchell for SE Asia and Don 
Johnson for South Asia (others for Japan and China).  So far, 
the DAL has been developing its infrastructure.  For example, 
they are using the Dublin Core standard, some of the MARC 
codes, and will use the OCLC site search.  They are not 
digitizing resources but are working on ways to identify them.  
There will be some standardizations regarding priority for 
identifying resources across the subject categories.  
<I>Phase two of the project will create an international 
scholarly journal.</I>  Amy used to work on the &quot;Scout 
Report&quot; <li>http://www.scout.cs.wisc.edu] and the 
format from this project may carry over into DAL.  The final 
phase of the project will be a database of free electronic 
resources specific to Asia.  Some discussion: 
1) Irene Joshi said that if the selectors were not finding sources, 
this fact also needs to get public exposure (which could 
lead to more cooperation, more impetus for resource creation, 
etc.); she also asked how they would maintain the database for 
long-term use to which Amy replied that they will incorporate 
two fields (date of review and date link last verified) to try to address maintenance; 
2) Mel asked about how to give feedback which Amy replied 
was built into the system; 
3) Monica Ghosh wondered how the areas would be divided 
out (in terms of percentages, etc) to which Amy replied each 
selector was expected to identify a certain number of resources a month; 
4) Merry Burlingham wondered about non-roman issues to which both 
Carol and Amy said there will be no language restrictions but in 
some cases the end-user will have to have his/her own plug-ins, etc.

<B>VII.  DSAL Report</B>

<P>David Magier reported on the DSAL project.  He 
distributed a handout which outlines the major sub-projects 
of  DSAL.  He explained that the DSAL will encompass a 
broad continuum of projects and participants, from institutions 
with their own funding and resources but without server space 
to those creating new digital resources.  The DSAL is housed 
and under the administration of CRL and it�s new project 
manager is Rebecca Moore.  DSAL has purchased a 35-gigabyte 
drive server so they don�t anticipate any limitations on the server 
space necessitated by the project.  David gave explained the handout further:
<OL>

<li>full text resources

<li>pedagogical resources�these are mostly geared towards language instruction

<li>Official Publications of India�they have started with the 24,000 
pre-Independence titles indentified by Sims but will add in a 
database of post-Independence documents to be created by 
Oxford <li>in the case of scanning, they will do it from the film]

<li>statistical data�they may get permission to re-publish stuff 
published by the GOI

<li>cartographic materials�this will include maps from the British 
Library; an index to the India Office &quot;Y&quot; class maps; 
they are using &quot;Mr. CID&quot; <li>Mr. Syd?] software for 
high-resolution, navigatable maps

<li>photo archives�of the 250,000 photos from the BL, 80,000 
from the Survey of India will be digitized; 10,000 photos from 
CSSC in Calcutta; photos from a Jesuit archive in Tamilnadu; 
the AIIS photo archive (125,000+ images)

<li>periodical indexing�this has already started and is progressing 
smoothly.  The English records are going into the BAS and David 
gave the aside that the vernacular record will eventually also go into the BAS</OL>

<P>The Dictionaries Project will also have Rebecca Moore 
as its program manager.
<P>The urls for the projects are:

<FONT SIZE=3><P>James Simon pointed out that all the DSAL 
information would eventually migrate to the server at CRL.

<P>There will be a &quot;major publicity event&quot; after more 
input and production in order to get more people involved and aware of the project.

<P>There was a question about where SAMP might fit into the DSAL 
project to which David suggested that DSAL could work in 
collaboration within the greater SAMP project.

<B>VIII.  Round Robin</B>

<UL>
<li>James Simon reminded us of the SAMP meeting on the 10<SUP>th</SUP>.
<li>Allen Thrasher reported that the new library technician (who had 
retired from LC-Delhi) was working out well.  He says they have 
caught up with their shelving at LC.  He reports that the South Asian 
language MLC will be the first stuff to go to the remote storage module.  
LC has just ordered the IDC census and gazetteer films.  They have 
acquired a number of Urdu manuscripts from a private source.  The 
ILS is now up and working although there is no news on the vernacular 
capability of the new system.

<li>Ray Lum reported that Harvard has acquired the Daniel Engels collection.

<li>Mel Thatcher reported that the Genealogical Society is filming the civil 
registration for Indians in South Africa (they�re already done this for Figi).

<li>Monica Ghosh reported that Hawaii�s Southeast Asia librarian has retired 
and that they�re looking for applicants. </UL>
