<P><B>Addendum to notes: Binding Policy statement</B><BR>
by Carol Mitchell, Deputy Field Director, LC-Delhi<BR>
dated 11/22/04, communicated through e-mail</P>

<P>SACAP binding policy.  During the recent CONSALD meeting, the New Delhi
Office proposed changes to the SACAP binding policy that would reduce
the number of titles bound by the New Delhi Office.  This policy would
improve the delivery of non-publisher bound materials (paperbound
titles) to participants while reducing the cost to individual
participant binding invoices.</P>

<P>Background: Over the past few years, the New Delhi Office has noticed a
marked improvement in the quality of paper bound/soft cover books.
Attractive covers combined with improved paper and sewn bindings produce
books that should withstand the normal usage in a university or special
library.  Some of these softbound titles are problematic because of
narrow margins. The absence of quality perma-bound practices has led to
bindings too small to open without causing problems with the binding.</P>

<P>Solution: The New Delhi Office will initiate a program to review soft
cover/paper bound titles screening out those titles that do not need or
should not hardcover binding by an outside contractor.  These titles
would be shipped to participants with the regular documentation
(including bibliographic records) as soft cover paper bound books.</P>

<P>Participants at the October CONSALD agreed to this policy. This is to
solicit feedback from other South Asia Acquisitions Program (SACAP)
participants.  Please submit comments by December 1, 2004 at which time
we will review the SACAP participant binding policy.</P>
