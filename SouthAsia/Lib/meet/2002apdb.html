<P><B>* URDU RESEARCH CENTRE, HYDERABAD. Jim Nye. </B><BR>

&nbsp;The salvage firm Cromwell is doing a good job of treating the
flood-damaged material. The cost is $253,000. Freeze drying is being
done and there are good prospects for recovery. Cataloging and indexing
are going on, also digitizing; unbound books will be filmed after they
are cleaned.</P>

<P><B>* CENTER FOR SOUTH ASIA LIBRARIES.  David Magier.</B><BR>

&nbsp;The Center for Research Libraries received a grant on behalf of
the Center for South Asia Libraries from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
for a Planning Meeting at New Delhi in March. Columbia University and
the University of Chicago joined CRL in organizing the event for the
purposes of discussing preservation and access problems for South Asian
materials and the operating methods, funding, administration, etc. of
this international federation of libraries working together on projects
and collections in the subcontinent. Other institutions participating
were: the Urdu Research Centre (Hyderabad), Sundarayya Vignana Kendram
(Hyderabad), Roja Muthiah Research Library (Chennai), Madan Puraskar
Pustakalaya (Kathmandu), Center for Studies in Social Sciences
(Calcutta), British Library, Library of Congress, New Delhi, Royal
Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, and National Library of Bangladesh.
Pakistan and Sri Lanka were not directly represented but have been in
close contact with organizers. Each Center will have the same mission
statement, i.e.  worldwide accessibility of South Asian research
material to scholars within the subcontinent as well as elsewhere in the
world.  The first step in the plan is to set up teams by language
expertise.  These teams will identify the 10 best collections
(libraries) for each language.-5 within the subcontinent and 5 outside
the subcontinent.  The newly agreed mission statement for the CSAL is:
"The Center for South Asia Libraries' mission is to foster the
identification, documentation, and preservation of research materials
 for South Asian studies and to facilitate their accessibility 
and exchange for the benefit of scholarship on South Asia world-wide." </P>

&nbsp;Highlights of the past few weeks have already been sent to the
listserve. Repeated request for missing issues of "<A
HREF="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/socialscientist/"
TARGET="_blank">Social Scientist</A>" that need to be scanned . These
would have to be duplicates, since they would be cut and fed into
scanner. Full text of this title and the "<A
HREF="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/artsandideas/"
TARGET="_blank">Journal of Arts &amp; Ideas</A>" will be made available
online. Re: maps, Jim Nye reported that the Survey of India maps will be
scanned. Rebecca noted that map-scanning is a slow process; a subset of
the BAS (about 4,000 records) will be available on <A
HREF="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/" TARGET="_blank">DSAL</A>.<BR> In
response to question on Punjabi dictionaries from Rajwant Chilana,
Rebecca said that he should provide her with 1 or 2 titles, so that she
could include them as future dictionary projects.</P>

<P><B>* Center for Research Libraries. James Simon.</B> New President
Bernard Reilly has shown positive response to Area Studies; the report
of the Collection Assessment Project has been completed, and has several
recommendations which will include future directions for CRL. The
backlog of 800,000 foreign dissertations will be cataloged. There will
be a review of serials and government documents. If a title is held by 5
or more libraries, CRL will drop that title. But the list will first be
presented to CONSALD before being dropped. If fewer than 5 libraries
receive a particular title, CRL will try to acquire.<BR> Avinash
commented that CRL should collect less-known serials from areas such as
Orissa, Rajasthan, Assam, etc. <BR> <I>(digital projects meeting
report&#133;&#133;.)  ???? no notes available.</I></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to disruption of the Brentwood Mail
facility, there have been horrendous mail delays. In addition,
irradiation treatment has damaged all the mail received <B>after</B>
Oct. 12, 2001.  Payments made by participants and mailed after Oct. 12,
have not been received at LC. Participants received mail directly from
Islamabad, but LC did not. Current mail is being vacuumed to detect
dangerous microbes.<BR> Re: Islamabad, Jim Armstrong was evacuated after
the Church attack.  In the meantime the contact person at Islamabad will
be Rukhsana Saood.</P>

The morale of the acquisition staff is good.<BR>

Re: cataloging, some collection level cataloging is being done with a
505 contents note. <BR>

Recently acquired posters of Osama Bin Laden will be scanned into David
Magier's website. Re: black binding on material from Pakistan, Avinash
requested that the color be changed. However the group consensus was to
retain the same color. <BR> Rukhsana will be undergoing training at LC
in Washington for the intergrated system, which is already in place at
New Delhi.</P>

<P><B>* LC - New Delhi Office. Atish Chatterjee</B><BR>

They are proceeding with acquisition of material from all local
organizations in New Delhi. In the past 5 months 2000 pieces (monographs
and serials) have been gathered from the 220 sources visited. With
regard to musical CD's and DVD's they are trying to acquire better
quality material. Re: multipart monographs, the titles are attractive,
but content is of poor quality; therefore they will be sent as
circulars. The recording of Indian authors is continuing, with 79
recordings so far; Carol Mitchell visited Sri Lanka and recorded 7
authors. Copies of these recordings have been sent to the authors.
Pre-Taleban material has been received from the Islamabad office. They
are creating a microfilm collection consisting of media coverage of the
9/11 attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon, and the war on terrorism. They
are in the process of filming "Desh" from 1933 to date; "Ananda Bazaar
Patrika" from 1922-44 also being filmed. The New Delhi staff is
being trained in cataloging and classification of the social sciences.
The American Institute of Sri Lankan Studies has joined the program to
receive books from Sri Lanka and India (about Sri Lanka only) for their
newly created library in Colombo.
