<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Alan Grosenheider announced that Irene Joshi is still
working on some bibliographies and that she still comes into
Washington's Library from time to time.  She can be reached
at her same email address.</li>

 <li>The <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/mar2000.html">
minutes from the CONSALD meeting at the San Diego</a> AAS meeting were
passed.</li>

 <li>Ved Kayastha wondered if Narindar Aggarwal was ever
sent a retirement present from CONSALD.  Alan G. will check
on this.</li>

 <li>Merry Burlingham gave a brief treasurer's report.
CONSALD currently has $1,093.29 in its account.  Some of
this money will be used to pay for the room used for the
CONSALD e-resources program being held in the Pyle Center on
the 15<sup>th</sup>.</li>

<font size=""><b>II. AAS Development Funds</b></font><p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>

<li>Alan had sent out a request to the CONSALD list for
suggestions for ways to use the AAS funds but received no
responses.  Alan informed us that these funds will be
available each year and encouraged us to have some
discussion on what CONSALD would like to use them for.  One
suggestion was to use them as CORMOSEA has, namely for
vernacular indexing for the Bibliography of Asian Studies.
Another suggestion was to use this money to support future
CONSALD sponsored workshops and presentations (like the
upcoming "Navigating between the oases of the Internet") at
conferences like the AAS.</li>
</ul>

<font size=""><b>III. CONSALD Activities</b></font>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>The upcoming presentation, "Navigating between the 
oases of the Internet:
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libraries/indiv/area/sarai/" target="_blank">SARAI</a> and beyond" was discussed.  It
seems that this is the first CONSALD sponsored presentation
of this type in years (there used to be CONSALD panels years
ago at the Madison conference).  We discussed whether or not
we would like to do this type of thing in the future.  Ved
argued that AAS and Madison are very different venues and
that we would have to gear such presentations accordingly.
 For example, Madison is not only specifically South Asia
focused but also draws people from smaller colleges, etc.
Merry wondered if a joint CONSALD and
<a href="http://www.library.wisc.edu/guides/SEAsia/cormosea/" 
target="_blank">CORMOSEA</a>
presentation might be of interest.  David Magier suggested
that it might be good to expand to resources from all of
Asia at a potential AAS presentation.  Rebecca Moore
wondered if a presentation centered on technical issues
(such as the non-roman font problem, etc) would be of
interest.  Afeworki Paulos suggested a presentation on the
uses of technology for instructional purposes (support of
teaching, etc).  Don Johnson suggested that we could follow
the pattern of the video and poster sessions at Madison and
have online demonstrations.  He will check with Joe Elder to
see if such a thing is feasible in Madison.  David and
Rebecca volunteered to work on a presentation for this
year's AAS.</li>

 <li>Philip McEldowney updated us on
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/salnaq/" 
target="_blank">SALNAQ</a>,
CONSALD's newsletter.  He told us that it will be published
(online) once a year, two weeks after the AAS session.
Submissions will be solicited in January.  He suggests
submissions such as: discussions of problems people have
with manuscripts
<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span 
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>; event
announcements; perhaps something from David on DSAL; perhaps
contributions from the LC staff; etc.  Don wondered if we
might want to submit web reviews following the model of the
ACRL.  Perhaps these could come from LC folks or from
projects such as the Digital Asia Library, etc.</li>

 <li>More discussion on CONSALD as a group followed.   David
wonders if we should consider using CONSALD as a basis for
joint licensing of expensive digital resources (maps, GIS,
statistical data, etc).  Monica Ghosh suggested that CONSALD
consider engaging with activities at the International
Council of Asian Scholars to be held in Berlin, such as the
diaspora rountable that was organized by Ray Lum at the ICAS
conference in Leiden (1998) or the diaspora roundtable
organized by Rich Ritchie for the AAS.  Alan would like to
see CONSALD as a center for support and guidance, especially
for its newer members.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
<span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>
Krishan Khera suggested that CONSALD consider working for
cataloging in the original scripts.  Lygia responded that LC
is interested in this but that there are still too many
technical problems, etc.  Monica wondered if CONSALD would
be willing to expand our influence to various centers-that
is, could we as a group write letters in support of specific
centers, etc.</li>

<font size=""><b>IV. LC Field Office Reports</b></font>

<p><u>Pakistan</u>:

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>James Armstrong is in Nairobi until November
30<sup>th</sup> so Lygia gave his report.</li>

 <li>James says that publishing hasn't changed much with the
coup.  He says that desktop publishing is of marginal
importance in Pakistan.  The press in Pakistan had a few
weeks of restraint after the coup but is back to its normal
working mode.  Newsprint has become more expensive.  The
devaluation of the rupee has been difficult for the
publishing industry.  CD-ROMS from Pakistan are not good
quality although decent pirated software is freely
available.  The IFOS implementation and de-implementation 
has taken a considerable amount of staff time (keying and
re-keying, etc) and therefore there has been a slowdown in
new orders.  Overall receipts have dropped 4% due to this
slowdown.  Cataloging is also slow although the office
produced 1,644 records last year.  Shipping has also been
delayed.  In the past year, the office has made 18
acquisitions trips to 12 cities.  </li>

 <li>In James' absence, please contact Rukhsana Saood
(email: <a href="mailto:rsao@loc.gov">rsao@loc.gov</a>).</li>
</ul>

<br><u>New Delhi</u>:

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Lygia reported that due to the switch in systems there
have been late reports, different labels, different
bibliographic printouts, etc.</li>

 <li>Two libraries need supplemental bills this year but
everyone ended with positive balanaces.  Lygia reminded us
of the need to pay our bills promptly.</li>

 <li>LC now has a full-fledged group for automation.  At the
LC Field Officers meeting in January, they will discuss how
to distribute/disseminate this automated information (such
as the Sources, Pamphlet and Serials databases she
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/2000ocdemo.html" 
target="_blank">
demonstrated in the afternoon</a>).  Lygia would like to
have some demonstration of interest in these automated
systems to present to people at this meeting in
January.</li>

 <li>Over 16,000 titles were sent out last year.  LC has
seen many cancellations in newspapers and serials over the
year.  Carol did most of the selection this past year.  The
rejected titles rate dropped this year from 42% to 37%;
Lygia thinks this may be in part to Carol, in part to better
books.</li>

 <li>The Sri Lanka program was re-invigorated this past
year.  The Colombo rep has been working hard on a number of
projects: internet resources and updates, serial surveys,
and the like.  Due to her increased activity, acquisitions
from Sri Lanka are considerably up this past year.</li>

 <li>The Mongolia program has seen an improvement in both
the quantity and quality of materials.  LC is getting a good
number of newspapers, serials and monographs from Mongolia
these days.</li>

 <li>13 fieldtrips were made this past year, compared to 17
last year.  In particular, the Kerala trip was quite
successful.  The trip to Rajasthan by the Malayalam selector
confirmed that the dealer in Rajasthan is doing a good job.
(Lygia passed around reports from the Rajasthani
dealer.)</li>

 <li>A number of cities in north India were visited to
acquire Tibetan materials-from these trips over 300 new
Tibetan titles were added this past year.</li>

 <li>LC is working on its bicentennial recording project.
The purpose of this project is to record Indian authors
reading from their own works.  At this time, LC has recorded
16 authors.  (Lygia passed a list of the authors.)
 Photographs are also taken at the time of recording.  Lygia
would like to have these recordings and photos mounted on
the web or possibly burned onto CDs.  In addition, LC is
exploring authors in the Indian diaspora to record.  If
people have suggestions for authors, please forward them to
Lygia.  In total, LC has already identified 100 authors to
record.</li>

 <li>Lygia asked for suggestions for topics to be addressed
at the Field Directors Conference in January, in addition to
a discussion on the recent NSF report and other automation
issues.  She wondered if topics such as these would be of
interest to participants: indexing of vernacular serials,
the capture and description of internet resources, a TOC and
delivery service (articles on demand), a restricted web page
for participants, etc.  Again, any suggestions would be
welcome by the LC office.</li>

 <li>Lygia reported that if the LC office were to provide
full cataloging for literature, the participant indirect and
overhead costs would rise from 21% to 31%.  Over the past
year, the LC office created over 13,000 catalog records and
over 7,000 authority records.  They converted over 80,000
reject records which, if there's interest, they can put on a
restricted web page for participants to check.</li>

<font size=""><b>V. CRL Reports</b></font>


<p>Rebecca Moore gave all the reports.

<p><u>ICON</u>:

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>The
<a href="http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/info/icon/icon.htm" target="_blank">
International Coalition of Newspapers</a> is a project to
create a union list of newspapers.  In its first two years,
they have entered over 20,000 titles in their online
database.  Twelve of these titles are going to be
preservation microfilmed, including two from South Asia
(<i>Kaiser-i-Hind</i> and the <i>East Bengal Times</i>). </li>
</ul>

<p><u>CRL</u>:

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Reading from Susan Rabe's email, Rebecca reported that
CRL has created 923 South Asia records this past year
(monographs and serials), a combination of new and copy
cataloged records for both recon and new cataloging of
mostly older uncataloged materials.</li>

 <li>CRL will re-do its website soon.</li>

 <li>The search for a new director is underway.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>DSAL</u>:

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Because Rebecca gave a detailed
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Lib/meet/2000ocdemo.html"
target="_blank">
report on DSAL in the afternoon</a>, she mainly responded to
questions in this session.  She emphasized that when we
refer to or publicize DSAL's url, we should use this one:
<a href="http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/dsal">
http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/dsal</a>.</li>

 <li>Rebecca will send out
<a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/techinfo.html" target="_blank">
the url detailing the standards</a> followed and
technological issues faced by DSAL.  DSAL is willing to
share suggestions on technological issues if anyone wants
them.</li>

 <li>The Sundarayya Vignana Kendram flood update can be found at:

<font size=""><b>VI. Round Robin</b></font>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Alan Grosenheider is working on establishing
relationships with the South Asian faculty at the University
of Washington.</li>

 <li>Philip McEldowney reported on the
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/infocom/tibet/" target="_blank">
Tibetan digital library project</a> (with David Germano)
and a recent 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/farsi/ldchubak.html" 
target="_blank">
Persian gift</a> at the University of Virginia.</li>

 <li>Lygia Ballantyne announced that there are two new
participants in LCCAP: Emory and the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill.  She emphasized that more participants
means cheaper overall costs.</li>

 <li>Ved Kayastha is soon to complete two bibliographies he
has been working on for some time: one on Indian immigrants
worldwide and one on Indic dictionaries.</li>

 <li>David Magier reported that his job duties at Columbia
are now 20% South Asia, 80% as the Director of Area Studies.
 In addition, he recently picked up duties at the reference
desk.  They have a new position for South Asian re-con
cataloging and have gotten money to rebind loose
publications in their Tibetan reading room.</li>

 <li>Monica Ghosh spoke of the current "interim period" they
are experiencing at Hawaii: they have an interim director,
interim CDO and interim catalog.  She is doing a lot of
instruction and working with the Asian Studies Development
Center.</li>

 <li>Catherine Lee reports that UCLA has hired a Southeast
Asia person.  Catherine has been busy with electronic
resources seminars.  UCLA has had three South Asia faculty
retirements over the past few years.</li>

 <li>Don Johnson's book, <i>Agile Hands and Creative Minds
</i>has been released.  The Digital Asia Library now has
over 500 South Asia quality urls and their descriptions in
its database.  If anyone has suggestions for inclusion to
DAL, please pass those along.</li>

 <li>Bronwen Bledsoe reported that Chicago is considering
plans for picking up the gaps left by the minimal cataloging
currently supplied by LC.</li>

 <li>Panna Naik has a new recently published book.  She is
busy cataloging at the University of Pennsylvania and told
us that Penn has a new "Bollywood" video collection.</li>

 <li>Usha Bhasker would like to suggest that we work to get
RLIN and/or OCLC to accept devanagari cataloging.</li>

 <li>Shyamala Balgopal is the acting head of the South Asia
division at the University of Illinois.  She has been
updating the reference collection and working to increase
the visibility of the department through an open house and a
newly revised website.</li>

 <li>Tim Bryson reports that Emory is still trying to
establish its Asian Studies Program, which will encompass
East and South Asia.  Emory is also having an increased
emphasis on international programs.</li>

 <li>At Indiana University, Andrea Singer reports that they
are finishing retrocon and cataloging uncataloged government
documents.  In addition, she mentioned Jim Canary's work
with Paper Road
(<a href="http://www.paperroadtibet.org/">
http://www.paperroadtibet.org</a>).  She presented at the
Midwest Conference on Asian Affairs and has been busy trying
to liaison with faculty.</li>

 <li>Mary Rader reported that she made a trip to India this
year.  Michigan is also exploring GIS projects and Rick
Saran is working on indexing Rajasthani journals.</li>

 <li>Afeworki Paulos reported that he made a trip to Ghana
in June this year.  Iowa is also in the process of
digitizing selected South African documents from the period
1960-1965.</li>

 <li>Merry Burlingham reported on a number of new hires,
including S. Ganguly and J. Brereton and Kathy Hansen as the
new Center director at Texas.  Of UT's enrollment of
approximately 50,000, 12% are of Asian descent.  This has
led to big recruitments for their Asian and Asian-American
Studies programs.  In addition, the Library has received
good funding this year through its Regents.</li>

 <li>David Nelson spoke of a number of changes at Penn
including the loss of their Center funding and a lot of
retirements (including in their language center).  However,
the library has received a better budget and they are
getting new hires (including G. Ghosh).</li>

 <li>Krishan Khera has been on sabbatical this past year
working on a dictionary of personal names in Indian history
from the earliest time up to 1947.  Krishan announced that
he will be retiring next year and that this would be his
last CONSALD meeting.</li>

<div id=ftn2>

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>This
led to some discussion of how to encourage new people.
Indiana has Mellon fellowships for area studies librarians
but this has not yet led to jobs.  Duke has a program for
mentoring Latin American Studies folks.  Ved, David and
Shyamala Balgopal all discussed the future of South Asia
librarian positions.   Lygia suggested that perhaps we need
to explore new areas and disciplines for South Asian studies
such as Business, Public Health, Population Studies, etc.
