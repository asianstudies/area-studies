<b>Center for Research Libraries Report - J. Simon</b><br>
At the <b>South Asia Microfilm Project</b> (SAMP) there has been a 
change in the chair from J. Nye to  R. Lum.<br>
Acquisitions - Crime in India in the 50s and 60s; Sri Lanka of 2 jounals<br>
Microfilming and cataloging continues. 19,500 titles filmed<br>
<b>Centre for South Asian Libraries</b> (CSAL) has been established as a non-profit body, 
approved by the Center for Research Libraries' Board.  Are proceeding to 
get it incorporated, working on the legal aspects and by laws.  Are trying to 
complete the process before John Simpson leaves at the end of the month<br>
Strong need for some start up money - looking at various sources, Mellon, etc.<br>
Eventually the CSAL will be part of the South Asia Digital Library.<p>

<a name="task"></a>
<b>South Asia Library Taskforce - Susan Rabe</b><br>
Reported on the meeting this morning; mainly two issues-<br>
1) Pakistani serial review to examine and eliminate deadwood
2) Cataloging uncataloged foreign documents; mainly copy cataloging.<br>
Including 545 Sri Lanka titles, 44 Pakistan and 285 Indian serials<br>
the Overseas Research Center serving scholars in India and the 
United States; Original concept - augmenting holdings of earlier prints; Distribution to 
scholars; coordinating acquisition of titles <br>
An arm of CRL, eventually integrated into CRL; trying to get outside 
support for incorporation.<br>
Some questions and discussion (Irene Joshi and Jim Nye) of the relationships, memberships, 
and funds between various organizations - CRL, SAMP, etc.<br>
Jim Nye reported that the institutions in Hyderabad and Madras have 
shown the way of how to do this at other places.  Will allow for 
cataloging of materials and then access.  Materials don't leave the 
subcontinent.  Tamil and Urdu materials are seeded to Indians after 
microfilming.  There is selective microfilming and digitization, but never 
all of the materials. <br>
 A. Paulos asked about copyright.  Nye said, if filmed, the film will be 
the copyright copy, and permission will be taken from either place; pay 
just over cost, using any extra funds to go for more microfilming.  But 
many things are out of copyright.<br>
Further discussion of the relationship between CSAL and SAMP; access, 
ownership, funds, bills.<p>

<b>David Magier reported </b>on a big private Nepal collection, 
which has become available, but needs lots of work for cataloging, 
preservation, and filming.  He looked at it last (1999) summer.  
The small local trust is interested in 
collaborating, so as to make it possible to open it up and allowing 
the world to use it.<p>

<a name="lc"></a><b>Library of Congress Report - James Gentner</b><br>
He welcomed Carol Mitchell as the new assistant director in Delhi<br>
LC in Washington - the President has signed the appropriations bills, and 
we will spend it until 30 Sept 2000<br>
Reported on the implementation of the cataloging module; did not 
believe it had any impact on India books.<br>
A lift van was sent out last week; will begin to load a new one 
in India next week.  Pakistan is receiving books without records. India 
authority records are being loaded directly into OCLC<br>
The Integrated Field Office System is finally a reality.  It is being implemented 
in Cairo; in 2 weeks in Jakarta; after that in Delhi, Nairobi, Islamabad, 
and Rio.<br>

Discussion of the Supplemental bills - partly unpredictable by postal
rate increase; taken by surprise.  Lygia wants to re-iterate that we do
work on the profile system in New Delhi; last year selected 20,000
titles; Delhi has not decided to go to title selection like Cairo.  The
profile system does not allow to guess what will be published in any
single year.  In most cases do not miss the mark like it did this
year.<br>

Some discussions of circulars, quality of Indian language selection;
dividing Pakistani Islamic books between non-South Asia Islam and South
Asia Islam; and Pakistan's lack of a split between literature and
literary criticism.<br>

Also discussion of large, unexpected overhead costs, shipping, etc. and 
the fact that India acquisitions went up 58% last year.<br>
Pakistan - discussion of the recent coup there and Jim Armstrong's 
plans to go back into Pakistan.<br>
Discussion of the delayed Pakistan census (1991 census was held in 1997), 
and the materials that 
are gradually becoming available.<p>

<a name="digit"></a>
<b>Digital South Asia.  Updates from David Magier and Jim Nye</b><br>
Magier - got the grant.  Selection be governed by 1) academics and 
2) administrative bodies.<br>
Jim Nye - <b>Digital Dictionary Project</b>.  CRL based. Through a Consortia 
[the Columbia Triangle, University of Chicago, and the 
Department of Education 605] 3 part development - 1. Collection 2. Reader? 
3. U Class.<br>
In next three years, will select the best dictionaries for 24 languages 
(Indian language to English dictionaries), and best language to language 
dictionaries for the main Indian languages.<br>
Make these available at no cost on the Web, and at cost on CD-ROMs.<br>
David Magier discussed alternative funds for Sanskrit and Pali; but presently not 
enough funds for other classical Indian languages<br>
Doing these projects can act as a magnet for other projects.<br>
Jim Nye mentioned that Hindi and Tamil dictionaries will soon be up; and that 
Platt's Urdu dictionary should be up by the end of the calendar year.<br>
Don Johnson mentioned the U of Wis Digital Asian library, which will list 
and catalog over the next 3 years 10,000 websites.  Ohio State will work on 
Japan sites, Wisconsin on Chinese and SouthEast Asian sites, and Minnesota on 
South Asian sites.<p>

<a name="updates"></a> <b>Consortia updates</b>.<br> <b>SAC-West</b>.
Discussed what may be their future, 5 years from now<br> Build on
cooperative acquisition and expand.  May extend the Diaspora
collection.<br> <b>CIC</b>- (Afeworki Paulos) Dictionary and other
project - cooperative cataloging, and the Virtual Electronic
Library.<br> <b>SAC-East </b>did not meet.  <br> D. Magier talked of the
<b>1 year grant</b> last year which NY institutions received and used for
microfilming and cataloging about 2400 monographs, 1850-1950 titles.
<p>

<a name="newm"></a>
<b>New members</b>.  Tim Bryson of Emory University 
said he was trying to learn what 
all the acronyms meant; just starting out; and learning about 
library science.  Mary Rader of U of Michigan is trying to learn what has 
happened in the past in order to decide what will happen there in the 
future.<p>

<a name="other"></a>
<b>SALNAQ and other business</b> was delayed until the next meeting of 
CONSALD.<p>
