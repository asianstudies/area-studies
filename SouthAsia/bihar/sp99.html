<!-BYLINE-><b>The Times of India News Service and Agencies<P>
</b></font>NEW DELHI: Six persons were killed in Bihar on Saturday but the polling was by and large peaceful in the eight other states which also saw voting in the fourth phase of Lok Sabha elections.<P>
Chief Election Commissioner M.S. Gill termed it ``a very satisfactory day'' as there were apprehensions earlier that Bihar might witness violence comparable to the third phase of polling when 38 people had lost their lives.<P>
As many as 750 people, including two Bihar ministers, were arrested for breach of poll laws. BJP candidate from Patna C.P. Thakur was also detained for allegedly trying to take ballot papers out of a polling station but was released later.<P>
Saturday's average turnout was 51 per cent while the statewise split (percentages) was: Bihar 55; UP 50; MP 45; Orissa 55; Manipur 53; Meghalaya 52; Mizoram 45 and Nagaland 38. Repolling is likely to be held in 60 polling stations of Ballia, Begusarai, Munger and Arrah (all in Bihar) and in 10 stations of Muzzafarnagar in UP where polling was disrupted in Surjo village after supporters of a party clashed with the police.<P>
Bihar minister of state for cooperatives Shyam Bihari Prasad was arrested in Motihari for disturbing polling while minister of state for agriculture Shiv Shankar Yadav was taken into custody in Siwan following recovery of four rifles from his vehicles.<P>
Two persons each were killed in Nalanda and Barh constituencies from where defence minister George Fernandes and former railway minister Nitish Kumar, respectively, were contesting. One person died in Siwan while another was shot dead outside a polling booth near Anjai village of Chhapra district.<P>
Other prominent candidates in the fray on Saturday included Union ministers Ramesh Bais, Maneka Gandhi and Som Pal and former ministers Ram Vilas Paswan, Mulayam Singh Yadav, P.A. Sangma, Kamal Nath and N.D. Tiwari.<P>
Incidents of snatching of ballot boxes were also reported from Munger, Patna and Arah constituencies in Bihar. Naxalites tore ballot papers in some polling booths in Bastar but the polling was not affected.<P>
In north-east, several bomb blasts were reported in Nagaland capital Kohima while gunshots were fired in Dimapu shortly before polling began.<P>
A report from Shimla said 55 per cent voters exercised their franchise in the state. No untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the state.<P>
Voters of Lindur polling station in tribal Lahaul-Spiti district and two polling stations in Kangra district boycotted the polls in protest against the lack of development in their villages.<P>

`Total Revolution' is dead, long live three Cs 

									</b></font><p>
<!-BYLINE-><b>By Vinay Pandey<P>
<!-BYLINE-></b></font><b>The Times of India News Service<P>
</b></font>PATNA: Bihar loves ideologies, especially those of the leftist variety. No wonder, anybody who is somebody in the politics of the state claims to be a socialist. And everybody is a ``disciple'' of Loknayanak Jayaprakash Narayan.<P>
The JP movement of 1974, from which sprang most of the leaders dominating the stae's politics today, was built around the lofty ideals of ``Total Revolution'', which aimed at a corruption-free society, elections by consensus and right to recall. The Congress, accused of corruption and casteism, was seen by JP and his brigade as the main threat to democracy.<P>
Twenty-five years later, the ideals of 1974 lie shattered. The names of JP and Ram Manohar Lohia are heard only when a politician is paying lip service to them. The ``socialist'' parties of Laloo Yadav and Nitish Kumar derive considerable strength from their Shahabuddins and Anand Mohans. The Congress and the BJP are no execeptions.<P>
The boundaries between political parties were completely erased long ago. Many of those who, in 1974, symbolised the ``oppressive rule'' of the Congress are now part of the Janata parivar. One of them is Abdul Ghafoor, who was chief minister of the Congress government of Bihar during the JP movement. Later, he joined the Janata Dal. In the run-up to the present elections, he quit JD (U)-Samata to join the RJD but within a few days returned to the JD (U)-Samata fold.<P>
The inheritors of JP's legacy have taken the art of corruption and casteism to new depths and added to it the new dimension of crime. If the late Jagjivan Ram used to distribute saris and dhotis to woo dalit voters, a candidate today has to distribute arms and money among those managing his campaign. Bihar's politics is now firmly in the grip of three C's - corruption, casteism and crime.<P>
Interestingly, members of every political party claim they are forced to resort to muscle-power only to defend themselves against the terror perpetrated by their opponents. Thus, elections have been transformed into a strange ``Mahabharata'' in which each side claims to be Pandava.<P>
Some politicians are frank enough to admit that the spirit of 1974 is dead. ``Everything is finished,'' says JD (U) leader and defence minister George Fernandes. However, he puts the blame on the ``all-round decline in every sphere of life''. ``Politics cannot be isolated from the social milieu,'' he says. Of course, one can always indulge in a debate on what came first - chicken or egg.<P>
According to conservative estimates by political observers here, a candidate who wants to be in the reckoning in the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar has to spend a minimum of Rs 30 lakh. A good part of this money flows into the underworld - on acquisition of arms and for distribution among local musclemen.<P>
Bihar has 54 Lok Sabha seats. Assuming that only two candidates in each constituency can spend this kind of money and Rs 5 lakh of the amount coming from either side is spent on arms and musclemen, Rs 5.4 crore is pumped into the underworld during each LS election in the state. With the all-round economic downslide of the state and frequent elections, this is the only industry that seems to be prospering here.<P>
Like any other business, the stakeholders in this business - politicians and their criminal aides - too want to make the maximum out of their investments. The profits come mainly from the money meant for development. As a result, Bihar hardly has anything that can be called infrastructure. The condition of most roads is so bad that you should consider yourself lucky if with the best car you can travel more than 20 km an hour. There are stretches on which a 20-km journey takes two hours.<P>
Asked why he has done nothing to improve the condition of roads in his constituency, one candidate said the people of the area were so poor they did not need roads. ``If you give a Mont Blanc pen to somebody who has seen nothing better than a Reynolds ballpoint pen, he won't know what to do with it,'' the candidate explained. Later, inquiries from the locals revealed that renovation of the roads in the area could not be taken up because those favoured by the MP could not get the contract.<P>

Bloody battle of ballots feared in Naxal bastion 

									</b></font><p>
<!-BYLINE-><b>By Raj Kumar<P>
</b></font>The Times of India News Service<P>
ARRAH: Strife-torn Arrah parliamentary constituency, which sprang a surprise in 1989 elections when it sent an ultra-leftist as its representative in Parliament and which at present has a veteran Naxalite of yesteryears as MLA from one of its assembly segments, seems set to see another bloody battle of ballots with the dreaded Ranvir Sena throwing its hat in the ring -- through a proxy. The Sena, the outlawed private army of the land-owning class, has targeted Naxalites since it was formed to fight "anti-landlord" extremists in 1994.<P>
"I am here to win a voice of our own in Parliament," asserts Rang Bahadur Singh, nominee of the Rashtravadi Kisan Mahasangh (RKM), a front organisation of the Sena, in an interview to this reporter. And by a "voice of our own" he says he means a voice "of and for" the farmers who have immensely suffered at the hands of Naxalites in central Bihar.<P>
Sexagenarian Mr Singh belongs to Ichari village which comes under the Jagdishpur police station. This was the place where on March 29, 1993, ultra-leftists had gunned down five villagers and injured nine others of a marriage party when they were returning on Mr Singh's tractor. "The killings shook me no end and it was natural for me to join the RKM," the dhoti-kurta clad RKM state president said.<P>
He is hoping to attract upper caste votes which could spell trouble for the sitting MP, Hardwar Singh of the Samata, who had bagged 2.86 lakh vote in the last poll and whose "indifference to the farmers' cause" was the reason behind the Sena decision to join electoral politics. "Last time, we worked overnight to ensure Hardwar's win and the man after getting the certificate did not bother to visit our office," an indignant Rang Bahadur says. One of his aides adds angrily, "<i>office mein rakha phool aur mithai sukh gaya hamara</i></font>". But, Mr Singh points out, "our aim is not to defeat anyone but to win".<P>
The Sena presence in the fray has also added to the fears of poll violence in this constituency where at least 24 persons, including five upper caste men and 19 Dalits and backwards, were killed at a clash in one booth in Danwar Bihta in 1989 when the CPI-ML (then an underground outfit) had decided to contest the poll through its front organisation, Indian People's Front (IPF). The IPF nominee, Rameshwar Prasad, eventually won the seat.<P>
For its part, the administration feigns ignorance about any Ranvir Sena presence obviously because the Sena is a banned body. "The RKM is also not a registered party so we would not like to comment," said the district magistrate and returning officer, H S Meena, when asked about fears of violence.<P>
Outlawed Ranvir Sena leader, Barmeshwar Singh issued a press release on Thursday, describing the poll as "our <i>pariksha ki ghari</i></font>" and exhorted the Sena youths to give a befitting reply to those who grab booths or intimidate voters or mislead them, and ensure Rang Bahadur's win. "I'm sure Arrah will change its history and will emerge as another Chittorgarh after the polls," said the Sena supremo who is a fugitive from the police. Not surprisingly, polling in Arrah has now been postponed from its scheduled date on September 25.<P>

LALOOS BIHAR IN CIRCLE OF BARH
<p>

<pre>FROM SANKARSHAN THAKUR

Barh, Sept. 23 Vijay Krishna is a would-be giant killer who must by now be
terribly used to getting killed; every time he girds his loins and swings
his mace he ends up flat on his back.  Pity he has an opponent like Nitish
Kumar. Pity Vijay Krishna continues to think he can beat him.

Pre-poll forecasts of Nitish Kumars imminent defeat have become a bit of a
joke in Barh now. It happens every time.  Vijay Krishna puts out the
invincible arithmetic of the Rajput-backward-Muslim combination, spices it
up with anti-incumbency disgruntlement with Nitish Kumar and serves it as
his recipe for victory. And every time he ends up eating humble pie, with
Laloo Yadav for company.

Barh is a prestige seat for Laloo and Vijay Krishna; talk of worsting
Nitish Kumar is almost an obsessive pre-election preoccupation with the
two. But Barh is one of those things for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)the
more they want to win here, the more difficult it gets.

It is not at all surprising that Vijay Krishna is out predicting doom for
Nitish Kumar yet again. The Yadavs and Muslims are with him, the Rajputs
have consolidated, specially after this weeks daylight murder of a Thakur
trader, the mood is silently changing. Equations are changing quickly in
our favour, says a Vijay Krishna man at the RJD office in Bakhtiyarpur,
scene of the murder of the Rajput tradesman, You will see the result, the
anger against Nitish will show up.

Changes are taking place in Barhs vast backyard expanse but not to Vijay
Krishnas script. For the first time you can witness a formidable anti-Laloo
socio-political alliance coalesce in Bihars rural heartland: the BJPs upper
castes, Samatas Kurmi-Koeri support base, Ram Vilas Paswans Dalits, and
even a section of other backward communities brought in by the Janata Dal
(United). This is almost the combination that the Congress used for decades
to hold sway over the state. Only, instead of the OBCs, the Congress had
the Muslims.

The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has almost succeeded in conjuring
a social combination that threatens to uproot Laloo Yadav who has so far
looked quite invincible in his Yadav-Muslim-Dalit fortress, says a senior
official who has long worked closely with Laloo Yadav.

Anti-Lalooism surges in every election but this time it has a strong
platform. It is not a paper sentiment, it is actually working on the
ground.

This is not the first election in Bihar where defeat Laloo has been the
dominant slogan of anti-Laloo forces but it does appear to be the first
time that anti-Laloo sentiment has been channelised into a consolidated
political groundswell: the upper castes, the lesser backwards like Kurmis
and Koeris, the Dalits, all are in the drive-Laloo-out campaign together.

Barh is an instructive case in how the political nature of the alliance
against Laloo has changed. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the fledgling
Samata Party had struck a deal with the CPI(ML), influential in some
sections of central Bihar which is also Nitish Kumars homeground, in a bid
to undo Laloo Yadav. Nitish then was, in fact, projecting himself as future
chief minister; his anti-Lalooism was as strong as it is today.

But the 1995 result? Laloo swept Bihar with an unexpected two-thirds
victory and the Samata Party managed seven seats in the Assemblya tattered
figleaf barely covering its dignity.

The Samata-CPI(ML) alliance had remained a leader-level deal, neither
worked to transfer votes to the other. Nitish and other parties that now
form the National Democratic Alliance, seem to have learnt their lessons
from 1995 well.

The anti-Laloo alliance in Bihar this time is not merely about Nitish
shaking hands with Paswan and Paswan shaking hands with the BJP; it is
about their constituencies, their social bases shaking hands as well.

So if Nitish has been feeling a little insecure about the Dalit and Rajput
votes in Barh, Paswan and Anand Mohan Singh, the militant Rajput
protagonist from north Bihar, have sent in their platoons to help.

And if Anand Mohan Singhs wife, Lovely Anand, has needed to shore up
backward votes in Vaishali, Nitish has been there to campaign. Paswan
himself makes a strange sight speaking under the BJPs saffron banner but he
has done so quite unashamedly; and in doing so, he has sent the message
across:  the priority at the moment is to oust Laloo Yadav, doesnt matter
what compromises, personal or ideological, he has to make for that.

It is not simply arithmetic that the anti-Laloo forces have worked on this
time, it is also chemistry.  There is a sense now that Laloo is going, says
Paswan, because we have given one voice, one flag to the anti-Laloo
sentiment. Many of the people I am campaigning for in this election have
been my strong adversaries but we decided that in Bihar there is no bigger
adversary than Laloo.

Paswan and Nitish Kumar arent the best of friends, personally or
politically, but in Barh, as in Bihar at large, they have a common
adversary who makes their differences quite irrelevant. Pity Vijay Krishna.

<DT><FONT COLOR="#000000">Vijay Krishna is a would-be giant killer who must by now be terribly used to getting killed; every time he girds his loins and swings his mace he ends up flat on his back. Pity he has an opponent like Nitish Kumar. Pity Vijay Krishna continues to think he can beat him.
<p>Pre-poll forecasts of Nitish Kumars imminent defeat have become a bit of a joke in Barh now. It happens every time. Vijay Krishna puts out the invincible arithmetic of the Rajput-backward-Muslim combination, spices it up with anti-incumbency disgruntlement with Nitish Kumar and serves it as his recipe for victory. And every time he ends up eating humble pie, with Laloo Yadav for company.
<p>Barh is a prestige seat for Laloo and Vijay Krishna; talk of worsting Nitish Kumar is almost an obsessive pre-election preoccupation with the two. But Barh is one of those things for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)the more they want to win here, the more difficult it gets. 
<p>It isnot at all surprising that Vijay Krishna is out predicting doom for Nitish Kumar yet again. The Yadavs and Muslims are with him, the Rajputs have consolidated, specially after thisweeks daylight murder of a Thakur trader, the mood is silently changing. Equations are changing quickly in our favour, says a Vijay Krishna man at the RJD office in Bakhtiyarpur, scene of the murder of the Rajput tradesman, You will see the result, the anger against Nitish will show up.
<p>Changes are taking place in Barhs vast backyard expanse but not to Vijay Krishnas script. For the first time you can witness a formidable anti-Laloo socio-political alliance coalesce in Bihars ruralheartland: the BJPs upper castes, Samatas Kurmi-Koeri support base, Ram Vilas Paswans Dalits, and even a section of other backward communities brought in by the Janata Dal (United). This is almost the combination that the Congress used for decades to hold sway over the state. Only, instead of the OBCs, the Congress had the Muslims.
<p>The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance has almost succeeded in conjuring a social combination that threatens to uproot Laloo Yadav who has so far looked quite invincible in his Yadav-Muslim-Dalit fortress, says a senior official who has long worked closely with Laloo Yadav. 
<p>Anti-Lalooism surges in every election but this time ithasa strong platform. It is not a papersentiment, it is actually working on the ground. 
<p>This is not the first election in Bihar where defeat Laloo has been the dominant slogan of anti-Laloo forces but it does appear to be the firsttimethatanti-Laloo sentiment has beenchannelised into a consolidated political groundswell: the upper castes, the lesser backwardslike Kurmis and Koeris, the Dalits, all are in thedrive-Laloo-outcampaign together.
<p>Barh is an instructive case in how the political nature of the alliance against Laloo has changed. In the1995 Assembly elections, the fledgling Samata Party had struck a deal withthe CPI(ML), influential in some sections of central Bihar whichis also Nitish Kumars homeground, in a bidtoundoLalooYadav. Nitish then was, in fact,projectinghimselfasfuturechief minister; his anti-Lalooism was as strong as it is today. 
<p>But the 1995 result? Laloo swept Biharwith an unexpectedtwo-thirds victory and the Samata Party managedsevenseatsin the Assemblya tattered figleaf barely covering its dignity.
<p>The Samata-CPI(ML) alliance had remained a leader-level deal, neither worked to transfer votes to the other. Nitish and other parties that now form the NationalDemocratic Alliance, seem tohave learnt their lessons from 1995 well.
<p>The anti-Laloo alliance in Bihar this time is not merely aboutNitishshakinghandswith Paswan and Paswan shaking hands with the BJP; it is about their constituencies, their social bases shaking hands as well. 
<p>So if Nitish has been feeling a little insecureabouttheDalitand Rajput votes in Barh, Paswan and Anand Mohan Singh, themilitant Rajput protagonist from north Bihar, have sent in theirplatoons to help. 
<p>And if AnandMohan Singhs wife, LovelyAnand,has needed to shore up backward votes in Vaishali,Nitish has been there to campaign. Paswan himself makes a strange sightspeaking undertheBJPs saffronbannerbuthehasdonesoquite unashamedly; and in doing so, he has sent the message across: the priority at the moment is to oustLalooYadav,doesntmatter what compromises, personal or ideological, hehastomakefor that.
<p>It is not simply arithmeticthat the anti-Lalooforceshave worked on this time, it is alsochemistry.There is a sense now that Laloo is going, says Paswan, because we have givenone voice, one flag to the anti-Laloo sentiment. Many of thepeople I am campaigning for in thiselection have been mystrong adversaries but we decided thatinBiharthereisnobigger adversary thanLaloo.
<p>Paswan and Nitish Kumar arent the best of friends, personally or politically, but in Barh, as inBiharatlarge,theyhavea common adversary who makes theirdifferencesquiteirrelevant. Pity Vijay Krishna. &nbsp;

BJP GROOMS PASWAN TO TAKE OVER BIHAR THRONE
<p>
FROM KAY BENEDICT<pre>

New Delhi, Sept. 23

The BJP, with the support of George Fernandes, has begun grooming Ram Vilas
Paswan as its chief ministerial candidate for the March 2000 Assembly
elections in Laloo Yadavs gradually-weakening kingdom.

The move is a blow to Samata Party leader Nitish Kumar, who has his eyes
set on the Bihar throne if the National Democratic Alliance is voted to
power.

Though the BJP has several other stalwarts, like legislature party leader
Sushil Kumar Modi and finance minister Yashwant Sinha, who are also keen on
the top job, the party chose Paswan to kill two birds with one stone.

First, the alliance will pocket the six per cent Paswan votes in Bihar.
More important, it hopes to send a positive message to Dalits across the
country, who are traditionally anti-BJP.

While Kumar is waging a lonely war, Paswan has emerged as the darling of
Samata president Fernandes and the BJP leadership.

The BJP, and even Fernandes, are not quite at home with Kumar, who is
fighting a no-holds-barred battle against the formidable Vijay Krishna of
the Rashtriya Janata Dal to retain his Barh Lok Sabha seat. In the 1998
polls, Kumar scraped through by a slender margin of 15,000 votes.

BJP strategists feel Kumar is still wedded to his socialist image. Party
managers and also a section of the Samata leadership fear that Kumar, with
his backward Kurmi votebankabout four per centcould regroup the Mandalites
and emerge as another Laloo.

Egged on by reports that the NDA is gaining ground in Bihar, BJP leaders
are trying to work out a winning formula for the state. As the Muslims
remain staunchly anti-BJP, the party sees the Congress votebank as its best
bet. The Dalits and a section of the OBCs are still with the Congress.  But
the Paswan gambit means a chunk of the Dalit votes would fall into the BJP
kitty.

Realising this, senior BJP leader K.N.  Govindacharya, has held at least 10
meetings with Paswan over the past six months. Sources said Govindacharya
suggested that Paswan float a party of his own which would be backed by the
BJP in a few constituencies.

Paswan spoke to Bihar Jan Congress leader Jagannath Mishra, Koeri leader
and Samata rebel Shakuni Chowdhry and Rajput leader Anand Mohan. Both Mohan
and Chowdhry had quit the Samata Party following differences with Kumar.
But Paswans venture did not take shape as Chowdhry joined Laloos Rashtriya
Janata Dal.</pre>

Origins of Nationality in South Asia: Patriotism and Ethical Government in
the Making of Modern India

By C.A. Bayly, Oxford, Rs 575

C.A. Bayly is a historian who likes the idea of continuity. He prefers to
see colonialism not as a disruptive intervention in the Indian economy and
society but as a continuity of some of the traditions that had been created
before the advent of the British. He also highlights continuities in his
own work.

The concerns of this book, he says, go back to questions which he had
addressed in his first book, Local Roots of Indian Politics: Allahabad,
1880-1920, in which he wrote of networks of older institutions which
propped up the Congress in Allahabad. Nationalism had a pre-history. In his
next book, Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars: North Indian Society during the
age of British Expansion, 1770-1870 , he made the suggestion that some
features of modern Indian civil society harked back to the tradition of
corporate rights and governance inherent in the organization and ideologies
of the traditional Indian merchant communities. The third book, Empire and
Information: Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India
1780-1870 , analysed the density of social communication and suggested this
to be an important factor in explaining how nationalism spread in a poor
country with a low level of literacy.  Nationalism and colonialism could
not be understood as imports from the West. Both had indigenous roots.

At the heart of this book lies the text of the Radhakrishnan Lectures
delivered in the University of Oxford in 1996. Bayly looks at the
interaction between patriotism and nationalism.  He uses the term
patriotism to describe the sense of loyalty to place and institutions which
bound some Indians, even in the immediate pre-colonial period, to their
regional homelands. Baylys use of the word is deliberately provocative
since he wants to push the study of Indian nationalism away from where
modernists and their critics have taken it. Historians inspired by the
national movement saw nationalism in India as the harbinger of the modern
nation-state. From the Eighties this position has been attacked by scholars
like Partha Chatterjee, Ranajit Guha and Ashis Nandy who saw the Indian
nation-state as the inheritor of the centralizing and normalizing
tendencies inherent in its European exemplar since the time of the
Enlightenment.

Bayly does not disagree with the view that Indian nationalism, its
organization and its ideology, was derived from Western models. But he
insists the particularities of Indian nationalism have to be understood in
the context of Indian forms of social organization and ideologies of good
governance that pre-date the full western impact even if they, in turn, had
been modified by colonial rule. In his analysis, nationalism has a longer
history than colonialism.

Bayly shows that identities of and doctrines wider than the village, the
clan and the community were forming and reforming in immediate pre-colonial
India. This patriotism was aware even of parties and crises in the British
domestic political systemwitness its reactions during Warren Hastingss
impeachmentand even when coloured by religion, region or caste was pitched
more broadly. These sentiments with the new mediums of communication
created the beginnings of oppositional politics in India which pre-dated by
two generations self-consciously nationalist critiques of British rule.
Bayly reinterprets the revolt of 1857 in this light.

Bayly accepts now, under pressure from recent work done on the revolt, that
it was something more than a concatenation of grievances. He sees it now as
a set of patriotic revolts picking up on many themes of land and kingship.
This is a welcome acknowledgment of the work done by Indian historians.
Bayly very deftly weaves many of their findings and conclusions into his
own analysis. But very few of these historians will accept Baylys
minimalization of the impact of British rule on Indian society. If there is
continuity anywhere it is in the debate.</pre>

<p>The concerns of this book, he says, go back to questions which he had
addressed in his first book, <i>Local Roots of Indian Politics: Allahabad,
1880-1920</i>, in which he wrote of networks of older institutions which
propped up the Congress in Allahabad. Nationalism had a pre-history. In his
next book, <i>Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars: North Indian Society during the
age of British Expansion, 1770-1870</i>, he made the suggestion that some
features of modern Indian civil society harked back to the tradition of
corporate rights and governance inherent in the organization and ideologies
of the traditional Indian merchant communities. The third book, <i>Empire
and Information: Intelligence Gathering and Social Communication in India
1780-1870</i>, analysed the density of social communication and suggested
this to be an important factor in explaining how nationalism spread in a
poor country with a low level of literacy. Nationalism and colonialism
could not be understood as imports from the West. Both had indigenous
roots.

<p>At the heart of this book lies the text of the Radhakrishnan Lectures
delivered in the University of Oxford in 1996. Bayly looks at the
interaction between patriotism and nationalism. He uses the term patriotism
to describe "the sense of loyalty to place and institutions which bound
some Indians, even in the immediate pre-colonial period, to their regional
homelands." Bayly's use of the word is deliberately provocative since he
wants to push the study of Indian nationalism away from where modernists
and their critics have taken it. Historians inspired by the national
movement saw nationalism in India as the harbinger of the modern
nation-state. From the Eighties this position has been attacked by scholars
like Partha Chatterjee, Ranajit Guha and Ashis Nandy who saw the Indian
nation-state as the inheritor of the centralizing and normalizing
tendencies inherent in its European exemplar since the time of the
Enlightenment.

<p>Bayly does not disagree with the view that Indian nationalism, its
organization and its ideology, was derived from Western models. But he
insists "the particularities of Indian nationalism have to be understood
in the context of Indian forms of social organization and ideologies of
good governance that pre-date the full western impact even if they, in
turn, had been modified by colonial rule". In his analysis, nationalism
has a longer history than colonialism.

<p>Bayly shows that identities of and doctrines wider than the village, the
clan and the community were forming and reforming in immediate pre-colonial
India. This patriotism was aware even of parties and crises in the British
domestic political system -- witness its reactions during Warren
Hastings's impeachment -- and even when coloured by religion, region or
caste was pitched more broadly. These sentiments with the new mediums of
communication created the beginnings of oppositional politics in India
which pre-dated by two generations self-consciously nationalist critiques
of British rule. Bayly reinterprets the revolt of 1857 in this light.

<p>Bayly accepts now, under pressure from recent work done on the revolt,
that it was something more than a concatenation of grievances. He sees it
now as a set of patriotic revolts picking up on many themes of land and
kingship. This is a welcome acknowledgment of the work done by Indian
historians. Bayly very deftly weaves many of their findings and conclusions
into his own analysis. But very few of these historians will accept Bayly's
minimalization of the impact of British rule on Indian society. If there is
continuity anywhere it is in the debate.

BLOODBATH SPECTRE OVER BIHAR ONPOLL-EVE<pre>

OUR BUREAU

Sept. 24:  Battered and bruised, Bihar braces for another round of
bloodbath in the second phase tomorrow.  Though the Centre has beefed up
security after last Saturdays violence spiral, the administration fears
that groups owing allegiance to the Rashtriya Janata Dal, BJP and the
Samata Party will unleash a no-holds-barred attack as much is at stake in
the state.

South Bihar was the worst hit by violence in the first phase as Naxalite
groups, which have called a poll boycott, struck with clinical precision.
At least 50 people, including 35 security personnel, were killed as the
Naxalites triggered landmines throughout the region.

Yet north and central Bihar, with over 29,000 polling booths, will not be
crawling with security forces. The strength of central paramilitary forces
has been augmented by only 15 companies, despite state police chief K.A.
Jacobs fears of largescale violence in Gopalgunge, Nalanda, Ara, Barh,
Siwan and Madhepura because of the profile of candidates. A red alert has
been sounded in these areas.

Besides, Naxalite groups have considerable sway over Bhojpur and Patna
(rural). There is a culture of violence in these areas, Jacob said.

Around 240 rounds of ammunition were seized from five persons in Asthana
area of Nalanda last evening.  The police also rounded up Raina Singh, a
dreaded criminal of Hajipur, during a flush-out operation in the disturbed
areas last night.

The marginal increase in the strength of the paramilitary troops is giving
the state administration sleepless nights.  There is nothing like enough
security forces, but we are going to bed with our fingers crossed, Jacob
told The Telegraph over phone.

Security forces would be deployed in remote Naxalite-infested areas after
screening the roads with mine-sweepers, Jacob said.

Though the officials are not complaining, the inability of the Union home
ministry to deploy more troops places the Election Commission, and also the
much-maligned Rabri Devi government, at an advantage. Pushed to the wall by
the Samata Party, which has hurled a string of accusations, the poll panel
has already requested the home ministry for more forces for Bihar. If there
is violence tomorrow, both the Rabri Devi government and the commission
will find it easier to pass the blame to the Centre.

While 132 companies of paramilitary forces were deployed in south Bihar
last Saturday, 147 companies will be stationed across the 19 constituencies
that vote tomorrow.  The state administration had demanded 100 additional
companies..

Union home ministry officials, however, say that states always demand
excess troops. But this is the best that can be deployed under the
circumstances. Security forces will have to be sent to Uttar Pradesh and
Andhra Pradesh as well, an official said.

Initially, south Bihar was sanctioned 119 companies and north Bihar 110.
But 13 more companies were deployed in the southern areas following a
request from the state government.

All parties have much to fight for tomorrow. In central Bihars Buxar,
Vaishali, Bettiah and Chapra, Laloo Prasad Yadavs party is facing its
toughest-ever challenge following the Janata Dal-Samata merger.

Among the stalwarts in the fray are Nitish Kumar from Barh, Ram Vilas
Paswan from Hajipur and George Fernandes, who is fighting to retain his
Nalanda seat.

Dal(U) complaint

The Janata Dal (United) today complained to the Election Commission that
the RJD was misusing official machinery in Madhepura, where Laloo is pitted
against Dal(U) chief Sharad Yadav.

Dal(U) spokesman Mohan Prakash alleged that criminals were canvassing and
coercing voters to support Laloo.</pre>

CORNERED LALOO DRIVEN TO BRAHMIN

FROM TAPAS CHAKRABORTY IN SIWAN AND GOPALGUNGE

Laloo Yadav is on shaky ground, even on his home turf. The growing
disenchantment with the Rashtriya Janata Dal coupled with the consolidation
of Brahmin-Rajput-Koeri votes has forced the messiah of the downtrodden to
opt for an upper caste candidate in Gopalgunge, his home district.

Brushing aside claims of top leaders like Abdul Ghafoor, Laloo has picked
Kali Pandey, a Brahmin, to retain his fief.  Pandey, a former Congressman
who till recently was part of the Jagannath Mishra camp, is known more for
his trips to jail than for his political acumen.

By taking the gamble, say RJD workers, Laloo hopes to split the Brahmin
votes and stymie the BJP progress.  But by doing this, he has given the
impression that the mirror of his caste structure has cracked from side to
side, says Mohan Dubey, a freelance journalist in Gopalgunge town.

Observers see Laloos decision to field an upper caste candidate as a
desperate gamble born out of the challenge posed by the Janata Dal(U) which
is positioned enviously to gain both the Paswan and the traditionally
upper-caste anti-Laloo votes.

In the 1998 polls, the RJD boss had a tacit understanding with Bihar
Peoples Party leader Anand Mohan in north Bihar to consolidate the backward
votes and split the upper caste ones. But Mohan has since switched
allegiance to the Dal(U).

The caste arithmetic of north Bihar was reflected in Gopalgunges
demographic structure. The Brahmin vote-share here touches 2.5 lakh. In
Buxar, it is at least a lakh. In Motihari and Champaran, the Brahmin-Rajput
division has always helped the RJD to scrape through. But this time, they
have rallied behind the Dal(U).

RJD leaders are putting up a brave front.  Politics has never come under
scrutiny on the moral sense of caste combination.  Politics is a constant
process of merging with the masses for magic power, says Jogesh Chaturvedi,
Laloos ardent supporter and his office secretary in Gopalgunge.

Laloo supporters like Harendra Yadav, a Yadav-Mukhia of Gopalgunge, point
out that with one Assembly segment accounting for 70 per cent Brahmins and
a sprinkling of at least five per cent in the remaining seven, the decision
is a wise one.

But the decision has raised a few eyebrows in the Yadav lobby. It is
difficult to convince the ordinary voter about the poll exigencies, says
Dinanath Yadav, a resident of Laloos village Phulwari.

Laloos elder brother, Gulab Yadav, is also puzzled. What could I say? He is
the best judge, he remarks indifferently.  By harping on the caste
arithmetic, Laloo has ignored other local factors. Four major sugar
factories have closed down.  One dalda manufacturing plant employing about
200 workers has also gone out of business.

Besides, the strong-arm tactics of Laloos kin have become a potent issue
for the Dal(U) candidate, Raghunath Jha. If Bihar has two chief ministers,
Gopalgunge has at least four, including two brothers of the chief minister,
he says.</pre>

BIHAR BEHAVES, MINISTERS DONT

OUR BUREAU

New Delhi, Sept. 25 Five persons were killed and two ministers arrested in
the second phase of polling in Bihar today, which was relatively peaceful
compared to the first round in which nearly 50 people were killed.

Following the bloodbath on September 18, the authorities had braced for
widespread violence today. Polling in other states, including Uttar
Pradesh, was also largely peaceful.

Chief Election Commissioner M.S. Gill said: The deaths took place in police
firing away from polling stations. There were two deaths each in Nalanda
and Barh and one in Siwan.

Shyam Behari Prasad, a minister in the Bihar Cabinet, was arrested in
Motihari for disturbing polling at a booth. In Patna, sitting BJP MP C.P.
Thakur was detained by the magistrate for trying to take ballot papers out
of the polling booth. He was later released. In the afternoon, another
minister, Shiv Shankar Prasad, was arrested for having firearms in his
possession. Unconfirmed reports said two more ministers were booked.

In some 60-odd booths there could be no polling because of heavy rains,
Gill said.

In the first phase in Bihar, most of the victims had died in landmine
explosions. Almost heaving a sigh of relief, Gill said:  It has been a very
satisfactory day today.

The overall turnout continued to be low at 51 per cent. Polling was
particularly dull in Nagaland and Mizoram.  The turnout was 55 per cent in
Bihar, 50 in Uttar Pradesh, 45 in Madhya Pradesh, 55 in Orissa and 52 in
Himachal Pradesh.

Sixteen people were injured in the violence in Bihar where 19
constituencies went to the polls, including Nalanda where defence minister
George Fernandes is contesting and Barh, where former railway minister
Nitish Kumar is a candidate.

In both Nalanda and Barh, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Janata Dal(United)
activists clashed with each other.  They were involved in shootouts and
snatching of ballot papers and police rifles. A villager was killed in the
crossfire between supporters of Nitish Kumar and his RJD rival. In Siwan,
where Mohammad Shahabuddin is contesting, activists of the
CPI(M-L)Liberation and the RJD exchanged fire. A Naxalite was killed in the
shootout.

Polling in Gopalgunge, Laloo Yadavs home town, was disrupted when the
polling party walked out following snatching of ballot papers.

The Dal(U) has demanded repolling in as many as 325 booths, including 148
in Barh and 64 in Hajipur.

In Nagaland, eight crude bombs exploded shortly before polling for the lone
seat in Kohima.

The Samata Party has protested against the Election Commission directive
asking Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala to stay away from
Bhiwani, where his son is contesting, on polling day.

<DT><FONT COLOR="#000000">Five persons were killed and two ministers arrested in the second phase of polling in Bihar today, which was relatively peaceful compared to the first round in which nearly 50 people were killed.
<P>Following the bloodbath on September 18, the authorities had braced for widespread violence today. Polling in other states, including Uttar Pradesh, was also largely peaceful. 
<P>Chief Election CommissionerM.S. Gill said: The deaths took place in police firing away from polling stations. There were two deaths each in Nalanda and Barh and one in Siwan. 
<P>Shyam Behari Prasad, a minister in the Bihar Cabinet, was arrested in Motihari for disturbing polling at a booth. In Patna, sitting BJP MP C.P. Thakur was detained by the magistrate for trying to take ballot papers out of the polling booth. He was later released. In the afternoon, another minister, Shiv Shankar Prasad, was arrested for having firearms in his possession. Unconfirmed reports said two more ministers were booked.
<P>In some 60-odd booths there could be no polling because of heavy rains, Gill said.
<P>In the first phase in Bihar, most of the victims had died in landmine explosions. Almost heaving a sigh of relief, Gill said: It has been a very satisfactory day today.
<P>The overall turnout continued to be low at 51 per cent. Polling was particularly dull in Nagaland and Mizoram. The turnout was 55 per cent in Bihar, 50 in Uttar Pradesh, 45 in Madhya Pradesh, 55 in Orissa and 52 in Himachal Pradesh.
<P>Sixteen people were injured in the violence in Bihar where 19 constituencies went to the polls, including Nalanda where defence minister George Fernandes is contesting and Barh, where former railway minister Nitish Kumar is a candidate.
<P>In both Nalanda and Barh, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Janata Dal(United) activists clashed with each other. They were involved in shootouts and snatching of ballot papers and police rifles. A villager was killed in the crossfire between supporters of Nitish Kumar and his RJD rival. In Siwan, where Mohammad Shahabuddin is contesting, activists of the CPI(M-L)Liberation and the RJD exchanged fire. A Naxalite was killed in the shootout.
<P>Polling in Gopalgunge, Laloo Yadavs home town, was disrupted when the polling party walked out following snatching of ballot papers.
<P>The Dal(U) has demanded repolling in as many as 325 booths, including 148 in Barh and 64 in Hajipur. 
<P>In Nagaland, eight crude bombs exploded shortly before polling for the lone seat in Kohima. 
<P>The Samata Party has protested against the Election Commission directive asking Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala to stay away from Bhiwani, where his son is contesting, on polling day. &nbsp;

BATTLE OF DELHI FOR BIHAR THRONE

FROM SANKARSHAN THAKUR

Patna, Sept. 25 It is easy to get confused in Bihar about what exactly this
battle is for. Delhi? This is a Lok Sabha election but it is being fought
like a campaign for the Assembly. The big prize they are competing for is
not the resplendent South Block, but the office of the chief minister of
Bihar in a mofussil corner of west Patna.

The Bihar election is not about installing Atal Behari Vajpayee or Sonia
Gandhi. It is about dethroning Laloo Yadav and Rabri Devi. The fight for
the Lok Sabha is not the end of the battle, just the means. Dilli mein
Vajpayee sarkar, Bihar mein Laloo ki nishchit haar (Vajpayees government in
Delhi will mean the defeat of Laloo in Bihar) is the reigning slogan. Even
when the Prime Minister comes to Bihar, he seems to shift his focus from
Delhi to Patna. He asks not for a vote for himself, but for a vote against
Laloo Yadav.

Help us finish off this jungle raj in Bihar, he told a rally in Barh near
here the other day. We have tried and failed in the past, give us the
numbers this time and we will remove Laloo for you.

It is perhaps a tribute to Laloo Yadav that he remains the main, and
perhaps the only, issue of this campaign.

Bihar is a battle between those who are for him and those against; Laloo,
and Laloo alone, is the cutting edge, as he has been for the past decade or
so. Even for the protagonists of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA),
the issue is not Vajpayee, it is Laloo. In Bihar, we are not fighting for
seats in the Lok Sabha, concedes Ram Vilas Paswan, arguably the most able
general of the burgeoning alliance against Laloo.  We are fighting to
upstage Laloo and his jungle raj. This election is about killing two birds
with one stone, if Vajpayee returns to power in Delhi, Laloo will have to
go from Bihar.

The script, as Paswan and fellow leaders like George Fernandes and Nitish
Kumar see it, is simple: If Laloos Lok Sabha tally goes down even by a few
from its current tally of 17 and if the NDA comes to power in New Delhi,
they will be able to engineer desertions from the Rashtriya Janata Dal
(RJD). Rabri Devi could lose her majority in the Assembly and state
elections, scheduled for the first quarter of 2000, could be advanced.

Already two senior ministers of the Rabri Devi government have quit, more
could join them after the elections. Most people still with Laloo are
fence-sitters, says Paswan. They are waiting to see how he does in the Lok
Sabha polls and if he does badly, they will begin to leave the sinking
ship.

This is, of course, not a new situation for Laloo. This is not the first
time he finds himself fighting a combination of parties single-handed.
Neither is it new for him to be faced with rumours of imminent revolt. What
is new is that the alliance fighting him this time is stronger than ever
before and his supportersYadavs and Muslims, essentially and more passive
than ever. Paswan has strummed Harijan militancy to a new pitch, the upper
caste-Kurmi-Koeri coalition of the BJP and the Samata Party is sensing its
hour, what with the Harijans joining hands, and the old Janata Dal is, in
places, splitting the Yadav-Muslim votebank away from Laloo; Madhepura,
where Laloo is in fray against Sharad Yadav, could provide the breach that
will sink Laloo.

Hitherto, Laloo has always managed to keep the arithmetic of social
coalitions on his side. He has kept the upper castes from uniting with
Dalits or sections of the backwards. He has divided and ruled. But with
Paswan joining the BJP-Samata combine, equations may change drastically.

For the first time in decades, says an analyst in Patna, Dalit votes are
going to be cast wholesale with upper caste votes.  Not since the heyday of
the Congress has any party managed to do this.

Laloos response to the widening axis against him has been to accept the
real threat and betray it to his constituency: Lose the Lok Sabha, he has
been telling his Muslim-Yadav boroughs, and it will be the beginning of the
end of your supremacy in Bihar.

Tum logon kaa raj, jo dus saal se chal raha hai, chheen liya jayega, yeh
garibon ke khilaf saazish hai, Laloo has been going around saying. This
(the BJP-Paswan-Samata coalition) is a conspiracy against the poor of
Bihar. You will lose power in Bihar if you dont defeat them in the Lok
Sabha.

Everybody knows that even Laloo knows that if he falters in the race to
Delhi, he will end up losing Patna.  No wonder he looks worried.</pre>

The Guardian Profile: Edward Said [Mya Jaggi reports]
<p>
 Out of the shadows
<p>
 Renaissance man, charmer, passionate advocate of the
 Palestinian cause, and 'the most respected
Arab
 intellectual in Israel' - yet this US
academic has had to
 defend himself recently against claims that he lied about
 his roots. Maya Jaggi on a man who has been
in the wars
 a long time
<p>

 Saturday September 11, 1999
<p>

 "The life of an Arab Palestinian in the
west, particularly in
 America, is disheartening," wrote Edward
Said in his
 pathbreaking book on western power's
invention of the east,
 Orientalism: 21 years on, in the thick of
one of the bitterest rows
 in years among America's intelligentsia, he
is reminded of those
 words, though outrage and the solace of
friends keep him
 buoyant and battling.
<p>

 On the eve of publication of his keenly
anticipated memoir of
 youth, Out Of Place, a small New York
magazine, Commentary,
 has alleged that Said, the foremost
Palestinian American, had
 through "30 years of carefully crafted
deception" fabricated a
 childhood in Palestine so as to invent
himself as a "living
 embodiment of the Palestinian cause".
<p>

 Though conceding that Said was born in
Jerusalem in 1935, the
 author, Justus Reid Weiner, claimed he grew
up in Cairo, neither
 residing in the Jerusalem house he says he
lived in, nor
 attending school there. According to
Weiner, Said and his family
 were not driven out of Palestine in 1947 as
refugees on the eve
 of Israel's creation. Bizarrely, he
suggested Said's imminent
 memoir furnishes a "corrected" version of
his early life in Cairo in
 panic at his unmasking.
<p>

 Weiner's argument crumbles with even mild
scrutiny, much of it
 resting on his refusing Said the right to
call his time in Palestine
 "formative", since his well-off business
family moved frequently
 between Palestine, Egypt and Lebanon until
1948. Yet its
 spurious scholarship has not prevented
newspapers from giving
 weight to its claims. Said found himself
denounced as a liar and
 a fraud in the Daily Telegraph under the
headline "Past catches
 up with refugee from truth". The Wall
Street Journal labelled him
 "The false prophet of Palestine".
<p>

 "You feel tremendous anger when you read
those lies," says
 Said in his New York apartment overlooking
the Hudson river,
 near Columbia university where he is
professor of English and
 comparative literature. "But I've trained
myself to use a steely
 cold resolve to fight back rationally and
calmly - though it's
 made easier by friends." Hanan Ashrawi, a
former student of his
 and PLO negotiator, was the first of many
to offer comfort,
 despite Said's steadfast opposition to the
1993 Oslo accord
 between the PLO and Israel, which he
described as the
 "Palestinian Versailles". "You begin to
realise it's a badge of
 honour," he adds. "These people are
attacking you because
 they're afraid of you and they take you
seriously."
<p>

 Now 63, Said revolutionised swaths of the
academy, and
 launched the entire field of postcolonial
studies, by insisting
 western culture cannot be understood
outside its links with
 imperialism, and that knowledge, far from
being politically
 neutral, is tainted by power and interests.
He has coupled
 cultural criticism with acting as the most
persuasive conscience
 in the west for Palestinian
self-determination, charting the
 difficulty of being "a victim of a victim"
and revealing how western
 guilt over the Holocaust masks injustice to
another people.
<p>

 A member of the Palestinian National
Council, the parliament in
 exile, from 1977 until his resignation due
to ill health in 1991, he
 was once known crudely as "Arafat's man in
New York", though
 since Oslo he has been among the fiercest
critics of the man he
 sees as an increasingly despotic "Ptain
figure", whose
 Palestinian Authority colludes with Israel.
Three years ago
 Arafat tried to ban his books in the West
Bank.
<p>

 In his 1993 Reith lectures, Representations
of the Intellectual,
 Said described the intellectual's public
role as that of
 "unaccommodated" yet engaged outsider and
amateur, divorced
 from the professional "expert" who serves
power while
 pretending to detachment. He argued
passionately for speaking
 the truth to power, "personal cost be
damned", and has tilted at
 both US expansionism as the world's
self-appointed policeman,
 and dictatorial Arab and Third World
regimes.
<p>

 Salman Rushdie once said of Said that he
"reads the world as
 closely as he reads books", and the Irish
critic Seamus Deane
 describes him as : "That rare figure: a
truly public intellectual
 who has a powerful influence within the
academy and also a
 potent public presence. He's a very
brilliant reader, of both texts
 and political situations."
<p>

 The combination has been a red rag to some.
In 1985 he was
 called a Nazi by the Jewish Defence League
and his university
 office was set on fire. He has endured
periodic death threats and
 blacklists, to say nothing of verbal spats
such as that with
 Bernard Lewis, the chief surviving
Orientalist in the 80s, or the
 late Cambridge anthropologist Ernest
Gellner, who derided Said
 - renowned among often drab academics for
being attractive,
 well dressed and having cultivated tastes -
as a "dandy and
 Manhattan bon viveur".
<p>

 Noam Chomsky, the philosopher, fellow
critic of US foreign
 policy and friend, says: "Edward's in an
ambivalent position in
 relation to the media and mainstream
culture: his contributions
 are recognised, yet he's the target of
constant vilification. It
 comes with the turf if you separate
yourself from the dominant
 culture." He adds: "His scholarly work has
been devoted to
 unravelling mythologies about ourselves and
our interpretation of
 others, reshaping our perceptions of what
the rest of the world is
 and what we are. The second is the harder
task; nothing's
 harder than looking into a mirror."
<p>

 Although Said is both weary and indignant
at the latest
 onslaught, he is reluctant to sue. Since
being diagnosed as
 having leukemia eight years ago during a
routine cholesterol
 test, he has other priorities. Last year
his doctor Kanti Rai (to
 whom his memoir is dedicated jointly with
Said's wife Mariam),
 revealed he had a rare form of the disease
unresponsive to more
 than four years of chemotherapy and
radiation. "It was
 depressing; my blood counts were
astronomical," he says.
<p>

 Last summer he put himself through a
gruelling 12-week clinical
 trial for a breakthrough drug treatment. He
relishes that he was
 treated "in a Long Island Jewish hospital,
by an Indian doctor,
 where all the nurses were Irish". But
holding up a three-page list
 of harrowing side-effects, he says: "I had
'em all. I was sick as a
 dog. I couldn't talk. I had temperatures of
104, 105, and shaky
 chills." The course - "a treatment not a
cure" - worked
 miraculously. His counts returned to normal
and the disease
 has since been in remission. But now, one
year on, it shows
 signs of an insidious return. Said blanches
at the prospect of
 further treatment.
<p>

 Though he tires easily, he still gets up at
dawn, teaches and
 travels, and remains combative. "I've been
in the wars a long
 time. They recklessly defame you to provoke
a lawsuit to tie you
 up for years. But they miscalculate; they
don't realise how much
 resentment they stir up." As Chomsky,
himself a veteran of
 smears, says: "It's a familiar genre. But
if they'd tried to
 discredit themselves they couldn't have
done a better job: going
 to someone's childhood home to see how many
family members
 they think could fit in it is something
even the most extreme
 Stalinist commissar would have shied away
from."
<p>

 Out Of Place, the most intimately personal
book of his 17 to
 date, and a "conscious effort at a more
literary form", covers his
 life till the early 60s, and forms a
"record of a lost world". The
 initial spur for the memoir, commissioned
in 1989, was personal
 grief. "My mother was dying [of cancer] at
the time and I
 thought, there's an end to a special part
of my life."
<p>

 Two years later, when his leukemia was
diagnosed, he found
 himself writing a letter to his deceased
mother, from the urge to
 make sense of a frenetic but seemingly
ebbing life. He began
 the book at the same time as he started
chemotherapy, in
 spring 1994, and for most of 1997 was
confined to bed or in
 hospital. "I worked on the memoir as a way
of fighting the
 disease. It gave me the strength and
determination because I
 felt my life was slipping away and it was a
way to reconstruct its
 foundations."
<p>

 Said was born an American in west Jerusalem
because his
 Palestinian father, Wadie, took US
citizenship after serving in
 the first world war. He was named Edward
after the Prince of
 Wales, whom his mother Hilda admired. She
was born in
 Nazareth of Palestinian and Lebanese
parentage. When he was
 two his parents moved to Cairo, where his
father ran a branch of
 the Palestine Educational Company, a
thriving book and
 stationery business jointly owned with his
uncle Boulos. They
 travelled constantly back to the extended
family home in
 Jerusalem and to the Lebanese mountain
resort of Dhour
 el-Shweir.
<p>

 Crystallising his own "overriding sensation
of being Out Of
 Place", Said says: "My story was
complicated, because the
 names were all wrong. Not everyone's
identity is a simple story
 from A to Z. There are other experiences
and countries that feed
 into it." A polyglot, he dreams in both
English and Arabic, is
 fluent in French and literate in Spanish,
German, Italian and
 Latin.
<p>

 He left Palestine for the last time in
1947, just before the nakba ,
 or "catastrophe", of 1948 [when the state
of Israel was created
 out of the territory of Palestine after a
war with neighbouring
 Arab states], and shared the "massive sense
of loss and
 dispossession that over the years clarified
itself into a narrative
 into which mine fits". Although his family
was, he says, driven
 out and lost all its property, it was
cushioned by the business in
 Egypt, and Said has never claimed to have
been a refugee. But
 his Aunt Nabiha worked for refugees in
Cairo. "I had a protected
 upbringing, but through my aunt I learned
the importance of
 service, which is what the Palestinian
cause always meant to
 me," he says.
<p>

 While Said sees the latest effort to
discredit him as "part of the
 attempt not to let us have a narrative" -
harking back to Golda
 Meir's assertion in 1969 that "There are no
Palestinians" - his
 memoir implicitly forms part of the
resistance: the insistent
 retelling from scratch of the other side of
the story.
<p>

 All the worlds of his childhood were lost
to him through political
 upheaval - Palestine, pre-civil war
Lebanon, cosmopolitan Cairo,
 where his classmates included Jews, Copts,
Armenians and
 Muslims. But he feels he was saved from
nostalgia by the
 deflating realities of family life; more,
he says, Butler's Way of
 All Flesh than Proust.
<p>

 The eldest child, with four sisters, he
says his mother cultivated
 an exclusive intimacy with each child in
"bilateral relationships
 as colony to metropole", a manipulative
technique he blames for
 "creating rifts between me and my sisters
that continue to this
 day". He also remembers with horror
"tremendous sexual
 repression". His mother blocked his
marriage to his Lebanese
 first love, Eva, by warning her against
him. His father's "Victorian
 design" was to correct his incorrigible
"naughtiness" with sports
 and extra lessons. To this day, says Said,
he has no concept of
 leisure or sense of cumulative achievement
and he's never
 learned to relax fully.
<p>

 "I have no blue-collar tastes, like
watching sports on TV or
 fishing, my son says. I fall asleep at
movies and I don't enjoy
 nature at all. But I love the sea - which
to me means the
 Mediterranean - and my idea of pleasure is
to play the piano."
<p>

 Surprisingly, Said grew up in an apolitical
household, "cosseted
 and buffeted" in a "gigantic cocoon".
Though he belonged to "a
 tiny Protestant group within a much larger
Greek Orthodox
 Christian minority within the larger Sunni
majority", he feels he
 grew up in a Muslim culture, "unable to
feel any identification
 with Christianity as threatened by Islam",
despite growing
 sectarianism among Levantine Christians.
But the memoir
 reveals the tensions of being an Arab with
a western education,
 shaped by the "three empires" of Britain,
France and the US. At
 Victoria College in Cairo, the "Eton of the
Middle East" (where
 Omar Sharif was head boy), Arabic was
banned. Expelled "for
 being a troublemaker" and banished to a
"puritanical" school in
 Massachusetts in 1951, he found himself
alone among
 native-born Americans.
<p>

 He describes an "unsettled sense of many
identities, mostly in
 conflict with each other, all my life". As
he says elsewhere: "To
 be at the same time Wog and Anglican was to
be in a state of
 standing civil war", a predicament
replicated as a Palestinian
 Arab in America. But he says: "I realised
it wasn't necessary to
 try to reconcile these contradictions, but
to have them within
 you as a potential, not a problem.
Belonging to both sides of the
 imperial divide enables you to understand
them more easily."
<p>

 Initially "tormented", Said felt an
affinity with Conrad, the subject
 of his first book - as with other "stubborn
autodidacts and
 intellectual misfits" - for his "loss of
home and language". He
 says: "I became more and more interested in
the construction of
 identities, and how rich a field it was."
He became politically
 aware of himself as an Arab at Princeton
during the 1956 Suez
 crisis and the emergence of Arab
nationalism under Nasser, and
 at Harvard during the six-day Arab-Israeli
war of 1967.
<p>

 The shattering Arab defeat was, he says,
the "dislocation that
 subsumed all other losses" and gave birth
to the Palestinian
 movement, though his parents disapproved of
his growing
 political involvement ("You're a literary
professor, stick to that").
 Said recalls the "re-emergence of the
Palestinian spirit and the
 stunned discovery to find in its ranks so
many friends, memories
 deferred and suppressed" as a time of
intellectual discovery.
 "Beirut, where the PLO was in the 70s, was
a world centre for
 liberation move ments. I discovered Fanon
and met Algerians
 and South Africans. I began to be open to
people from Asia,
 Africa, Latin America."
<p>

 In his 1968 essay The Arab Portrayed, Said
linked
 representation with power, exposed the
caricature of the Arab as
 terrorist or sheikh, and criticised Zionist
myths of an unpeopled
 Palestine. Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, who
commissioned the piece, a
 Palestinian-American friend from Princeton
now at Bir Zeit
 university in the West Bank, says: "It was
the first opening to an
 alternative view in the US to the Zionist
story. The presentation
 of Arabs as backward, militant and governed
by dictators was
 used to justify and applaud their
devastation by Israel, which
 imagined Palestine as an empty desert, the
Arab as a shadow."
<p>

 In a talk in New York last year, Between
Worlds, Said described
 being by the mid-70s in "the rich and
unenviable position of
 speaking for two diametrically opposed
constituencies, one
 western, the other Arab". He began to write
"contrapuntally,
 using the dis parate halves of my
experience, as an Arab and
 American, to work with and against each
other". His 1978-81
 trilogy on the relationship between the
Arab and Islamic world
 and the west - Orientalism, The Question Of
Palestine and
 Covering Islam - borrowed from Foucault and
Raymond Williams
 but made imperialism central. Ruling others
was made possible
 by the cultural representation of the
ruled, from the 18th-century
 novel to CNN. Said also saw the Palestinian
plight in terms of
 the universal "problem of the Other",
believing that "if you wish to
 uphold basic human justice, you must do so
for everyone".
<p>

 In his later Culture And Imperialism, he
extended his ambit from
 the Arab world to other colonised areas,
breathtakingly rereading
 the western canon from Conrad, Kipling,
Camus and Flaubert to
 Robinson Crusoe, the Tempest and Verdi's
Aida. Most
 controversially, he dared to suggest that
the apparent moral
 rectitude of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park
rested on the slave
 plantation. Through anti-colonial writers
such as CLR James,
 Frantz Fanon and Aim Csaire, he also told
the other side of
 the story, their "writing back" to the
metropolitan centre being
 what Said calls "the voyage in".
<p>

 Though he loves the literature he
reinterprets, and argues
 against a rhetoric of blame, Said is
sometimes rebuffed for
 presumption. He once translated an essay by
his admired Erich
 Auerbach, but when he sought the estate's
permission to collect
 Auerbach's essays, his son refused. Said
recalls with a trace of
 sadness: "He said my views were political
anathema to him and
 would have been to his father."
<p>

 The Gulf war began as he was finishing
Culture And Imperialism,
 which he ends with a critique of Desert
Storm, "the most
 covered and least reported war in history".
Furthering his
 argument in Covering Islam that insulting
Islam is "the last
 acceptable form of denigration of foreign
culture in the west", he
 saw the Gulf war as a paradigm of America's
cultural war on the
 Arabs: "Bomb them, humiliate them, lie
about them." In a
 post-cold war atmosphere where the "red
peril" has given way to
 hysteria about the "Islamic threat", the
professor had 25 calls
 from the media asking him to "explain" the
Oklahoma City
 bombing of 1995, before a home-grown
terrorist was fingered as
 the culprit.
<p>

 Yet Said, who feels he "belongs to both
worlds, without being
 completely of either one or the other", is
against reductive
 stereotypes on both sides, or Manichean
stands between "us"
 and "them". He writes: "Partly because of
empire, all countries
 are involved in one another; none is single
and pure, all are
 hybrid, heterogeneous". While he recognises
"defensive
 nationalism", he is suspicious of the
rigid-identity politics of
 "drum-beating roots affirmation", believing
in the "inherent
 irreconcilability between intellectual
belief and passionate loyalty
 to tribe, sect and country." Identity, he
says, should not be "over
 and above knowing about others".
<p>

 While his memoir hints at the seeds of his
thought, it skates
 lightly over sexual relationships. Married
for almost 30 years to
 his Lebanese-born wife Mariam, Said says
half in jest that he
 ended the book in 1962 so as not to discuss
his first wife. Of
 that marriage to Maire Jaanus, an
Estonian-German who also
 became a Columbia professor, he says:
"There's a symbolic
 dimension to it. I married a European. We
had nothing in
 common. She was very beautiful and
incredibly brilliant, studied
 at Vassar, Harvard, Cambridge. It was a
great ordeal."
<p>

 He does speak of an unnamed American woman,
a "Diana
 figure" who represented an "ideal America I
couldn't gain
 admission to". He explains: "It was tied up
with being out of
 place in America; a liaison with an insider
in American society.
 Though I had a western education, it was a
society I never felt I
 could join. In my wanderings I've been
fascinated with that sort
 of person everywhere, looking at them to
see how they belong,
 which is something I've never had except as
a child in Palestine,
 when I wasn't aware of belonging. They're
in the 'right place'
 unselfconsciously, in a way I've secretly
envied."
<p>

 Yet Said praises exile, and "the process of
intellectual discovery
 which relative rootlessness gives you",
without ever glibly
 glossing over its pain or the cushioning
effect of privilege. He no
 longer has the need to feel "at home".
Although he enjoys New
 York "where I shall be until I die", as a
"gateway city that's so
 much part of the world", he says: "I still
feel New York isn't
 home. I don't know where home is, but it
certainly isn't here."
<p>

 Preparing for a Labour Day vacation with
his wife, he describes
 his "sleepless near-panic", and his
tendency, "like all
 Palestinians", to overpack. "It's a panic
about not coming back,
 because of my first big departure to
America, or maybe earlier,"
 he says. "Last night I dreamt of losing my
carry-on bag, which
 contains all my essentials - my Filofax and
spectacles. But I
 constantly organise trips." It is also, he
says, a fear of being
 "defenceless, stateless".
<p>

 Although Said's father and sisters
travelled on US passports, his
 mother's Palestinian laisser-passer always
held her up at
 borders, till she gained Lebanese
citizenship in 1958. When his
 mother was ill in Washington, there was an
attempt to deport
 her because her visa had expired. "The
judge listened aghast,
 and threw the case out. He said to the
officials, 'you guys must
 be monsters'. A week later my mother died.
She'd say, 'I want to
 go home.' I'd ask, 'Where's home?'. But she
couldn't answer."
<p>

 In 1992 Said returned to Jerusalem for the
first time in over 40
 years, with his son Wadie, a lawyer, and
daughter Najla, an
 actress. He now makes frequent trips. After
his BBC film
 marking Israel's 50th anniversary last
year, In Search of
 Palestine, which passionately excoriated
the "peace process"
 for creating apartheid "bantustans" and
allowing more Jewish
 settlements, Said feels the timing of the
latest attack on him
 was "to discredit my memoir and me as a
witness and a
 spokesman". In the run-up to a final
settlement, and amid
 Palestinian calls for compensation and
their right to return, he
 says: "They think, if they can call me a
liar and a fraud, who's to
 say those poor peasants are telling the
truth."
<p>

 Yet Justus Reid Weiner, an American
resident in Jerusalem,
 was for 12 years an official in the Israeli
justice ministry, one of
 whose tasks was to defend the security
forces in the occupied
 territories from Amnesty International. The
obscure Jerusalem
 Centre for Public Affairs, which paid
Weiner for his three-year
 research, is principally funded by Michael
Milken, the former
 junk bond dealer jailed in 1991 for insider
trading. Commentary,
 a "neo-conservative" magazine, had a
previous effort at
 slandering Said 10 years ago, when it
labelled him "professor of
 terror", despite his consistent rejection
of terrorism or a military
 solution. And the Daily Telegraph's
publisher, Conrad Black,
 also owns the Jerusalem Post, which
supports the rightwing
 Likud party of former prime minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
<p>

 Rebuttals have flowed in, from Said's
teachers, relatives and
 schoolmates. According to Said, those
testimonies that ran
 counter to Weiner's purpose he ignored, not
least denying there
 was evidence that he attended St George's
Anglican Cathedral
 school in Jerusalem. Haig Boyadjian, an
Armenian from
 Jerusalem now resident in New Jersey, says
that when
 contacted by Weiner in February he clearly
affirmed Said as a
 classmate. He dismisses Weiner's claims as
"absolute
 rubbish".
<p>

 Said, though, is scornful of the suggestion
that he wields great
 power in the media. "The mainstream press
makes use of you
 when it wants to, as a token or a symbol,
but you have no
 access," he says. No major US paper, he
adds, would publish
 his response to Weiner, though it appears
in the Arab press, for
 which he has written regularly since 1993.
It has been published
 in Hebrew this week in the Tel Aviv
newspaper Ha'aretz.
<p>

 For him, the attack was recognition of his
growing currency
 within Israel, where even far-right
Zionists, he believes, are "less
 rabid and more in touch with reality" than
in the US. He has long
 pleaded for both sides to recognise the
other's history, and
 having now abandoned hope of a separate
state, advocates
 equal citizenship in a "one-state
solution". He says: "The
 politics of separation can't work in the
Middle East. The land's
 too small. Our history's so mixed." He says
the irony is that
 Weiner has surfaced just as Israeli
textbooks have been revised
 to admit dispossession and massacres.
<p>

 Israel Shahak, an Israeli human rights
activist and Holocaust
 survivor, says of Said: "Not only can he
crystallise the tragic
 situation of the Palestinian people but he
does it in a manner
 that the Israeli Jewish elite can
understand and respect. He's by
 far the most respected Arab intellectual in
Israel." Orientalism,
 in which Said likens the false
representations of the Arab and
 the Muslim to anti-semitism, is being
translated into Hebrew.
<p>

 Daniel Barenboim, conductor of the Berlin
Staatsoper and a
 friend since 1992, describes Said as a
"Renaissance apparition
 in these times of specialisation" with an
"indefinable moral
 authority". He adds: "We agree the time has
come, whatever the
 past, to make contacts between peoples and
not wait for
 political solutions." Said attended
Barenboim's masterclasses in
 Weimar last month with 90 young Arab and
Israeli musicians.
 Said says: "There were Arabs who'd never
met Israelis before,
 and Israelis who'd never met Palestinians.
It began with tension,
 but it quickly disappeared" - aided by his
10-year-old
 great-nephew, a piano prodigy from Amman.
<p>

 Seamus Deane thinks Said's anger helps
keeps him going; what
 Christopher Hitchens called, after Conrad,
his "magnanimous
 indignations". Perhaps too his relish at
his "lonely vocation" as a
 "secular critic". Asked if it's hard to be
reviled not only by
 staunch Zionists but by Palestinians who
back the Oslo and
 1998 Wye River accords, Said smiles
impishly and confesses:
 "But I enjoy it. It does concentrate the
mind."
<p>

 In his memoir he likens living with the
"sword of Damocles" of
 his illness to surviving exile. He says:
"When you find
 circumstances are too much, that they're
weighted against you
 and you're in an unfriendly camp, there are
always reserves,
 some stubborn faculty of resistance wells
up and you hold on.
 You realise you have more allies than you
think, that the other
 side might seem monolithic but it's not.
It's not self-confidence
 but an instinctive holding on, a love of
life."

	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif" SIZE=2>"The life of an Arab
Palestinian in the west, particularly in America, is disheartening," wrote
Edward Said in his pathbreaking book on western power's invention of the
east, Orientalism: 21 years on, in the thick of one of the bitterest rows
in years among America's intelligentsia, he is reminded of those words,
though outrage and the solace of friends keep him buoyant and battling.

<P>On the eve of publication of his keenly anticipated memoir of youth, Out
Of Place, a small New York magazine, Commentary, has alleged that Said, the
foremost Palestinian American, had through "30 years of carefully crafted
deception" fabricated a childhood in Palestine so as to invent himself as a
"living embodiment of the Palestinian cause".

<P>Though conceding that Said was born in Jerusalem in 1935, the author,
Justus Reid Weiner, claimed he grew up in Cairo, neither residing in the
Jerusalem house he says he lived in, nor attending school there. According
to Weiner, Said and his family were not driven out of Palestine in 1947 as
refugees on the eve of Israel's creation. Bizarrely, he suggested Said's
imminent memoir furnishes a "corrected" version of his early life in Cairo
in panic at his unmasking.

<P>Weiner's argument crumbles with even mild scrutiny, much of it resting
on his refusing Said the right to call his time in Palestine "formative",
since his well-off business family moved frequently between Palestine,
Egypt and Lebanon until 1948. Yet its spurious scholarship has not
prevented newspapers from giving weight to its claims. Said found himself
denounced as a liar and a fraud in the Daily Telegraph under the headline
"Past catches up with refugee from truth". The Wall Street Journal labelled
him "The false prophet of Palestine".

<P>"You feel tremendous anger when you read those lies," says Said in his
New York apartment overlooking the Hudson river, near Columbia university
where he is professor of English and comparative literature. "But I've
trained myself to use a steely cold resolve to fight back rationally and
calmly - though it's made easier by friends." Hanan Ashrawi, a former
student of his and PLO negotiator, was the first of many to offer comfort,
despite Said's steadfast opposition to the 1993 Oslo accord between the PLO
and Israel, which he described as the "Palestinian Versailles". "You begin
to realise it's a badge of honour," he adds. "These people are attacking
you because they're afraid of you and they take you seriously."

<P>Now 63, Said revolutionised swaths of the academy, and launched the
entire field of postcolonial studies, by insisting western culture cannot
be understood outside its links with imperialism, and that knowledge, far
from being politically neutral, is tainted by power and interests. He has
coupled cultural criticism with acting as the most persuasive conscience in
the west for Palestinian self-determination, charting the difficulty of
being "a victim of a victim" and revealing how western guilt over the
Holocaust masks injustice to another people.

<P>A member of the Palestinian National Council, the parliament in exile,
from 1977 until his resignation due to ill health in 1991, he was once
known crudely as "Arafat's man in New York", though since Oslo he has been
among the fiercest critics of the man he sees as an increasingly despotic
"P&eacute;tain figure", whose Palestinian Authority colludes with Israel.
Three years ago Arafat tried to ban his books in the West Bank.

<P>In his 1993 Reith lectures, Representations of the Intellectual, Said
described the intellectual's public role as that of "unaccommodated" yet
engaged outsider and amateur, divorced from the professional "expert" who
serves power while pretending to detachment. He argued passionately for
speaking the truth to power, "personal cost be damned", and has tilted at
both US expansionism as the world's self-appointed policeman, and
dictatorial Arab and Third World regimes.

<P>Salman Rushdie once said of Said that he "reads the world as closely as
he reads books", and the Irish critic Seamus Deane describes him as :
"That rare figure: a truly public intellectual who has a powerful influence
within the academy and also a potent public presence. He's a very brilliant
reader, of both texts and political situations."

<P>The combination has been a red rag to some. In 1985 he was called a Nazi
by the Jewish Defence League and his university office was set on fire. He
has endured periodic death threats and blacklists, to say nothing of verbal
spats such as that with Bernard Lewis, the chief surviving Orientalist in
the 80s, or the late Cambridge anthropologist Ernest Gellner, who derided
Said - renowned among often drab academics for being attractive, well
dressed and having cultivated tastes - as a "dandy and Manhattan bon
viveur".

<P>Noam Chomsky, the philosopher, fellow critic of US foreign policy and
friend, says: "Edward's in an ambivalent position in relation to the media
and mainstream culture: his contributions are recognised, yet he's the
target of constant vilification. It comes with the turf if you separate
yourself from the dominant culture." He adds:  "His scholarly work has been
devoted to unravelling mythologies about ourselves and our interpretation
of others, reshaping our perceptions of what the rest of the world is and
what we are. The second is the harder task; nothing's harder than looking
into a mirror."

<P>Although Said is both weary and indignant at the latest onslaught, he is
reluctant to sue. Since being diagnosed as having leukemia eight years ago
during a routine cholesterol test, he has other priorities. Last year his
doctor Kanti Rai (to whom his memoir is dedicated jointly with Said's wife
Mariam), revealed he had a rare form of the disease unresponsive to more
than four years of chemotherapy and radiation. "It was depressing; my blood
counts were astronomical," he says.

<P>Last summer he put himself through a gruelling 12-week clinical trial
for a breakthrough drug treatment. He relishes that he was treated "in a
Long Island Jewish hospital, by an Indian doctor, where all the nurses were
Irish". But holding up a three-page list of harrowing side-effects, he
says: "I had 'em all. I was sick as a dog. I couldn't talk. I had
temperatures of 104, 105, and shaky chills." The course - "a treatment not
a cure" - worked miraculously. His counts returned to normal and the
disease has since been in remission. But now, one year on, it shows signs
of an insidious return. Said blanches at the prospect of further treatment.

<P>Though he tires easily, he still gets up at dawn, teaches and travels,
and remains combative. "I've been in the wars a long time. They recklessly
defame you to provoke a lawsuit to tie you up for years. But they
miscalculate; they don't realise how much resentment they stir up."  As
Chomsky, himself a veteran of smears, says: "It's a familiar genre.  But if
they'd tried to discredit themselves they couldn't have done a better job:
going to someone's childhood home to see how many family members they think
could fit in it is something even the most extreme Stalinist commissar
would have shied away from."

<P>Out Of Place, the most intimately personal book of his 17 to date, and a
"conscious effort at a more literary form", covers his life till the early
60s, and forms a "record of a lost world". The initial spur for the memoir,
commissioned in 1989, was personal grief. "My mother was dying &#91;of
cancer&#93; at the time and I thought, there's an end to a special part of
my life."

<P>Two years later, when his leukemia was diagnosed, he found himself
writing a letter to his deceased mother, from the urgeto make sense of a
frenetic but seemingly ebbing life. He began the bookat the same time as he
started chemotherapy, in spring 1994, and for most of 1997 was confined to
bed or in hospital. "I worked on the memoir as a way of fighting the
disease. It gave me the strength and determination because I felt my life
was slipping away and it was a way to reconstruct its foundations."

<P>Said was born an American in west Jerusalem becausehis Palestinian
father, Wadie, took US citizenship after serving in the first world war.
He was named Edward after the Prince of Wales, whom his mother Hilda
admired. She was born in Nazareth of Palestinian and Lebanese parentage.
When he was two his parents moved to Cairo, where his father ran a branch
of the Palestine Educational Company, a thriving book and stationery
business jointly owned with his uncle Boulos. They travelled constantly
back to the extended family home in Jerusalem and to the Lebanese mountain
resort of Dhour el-Shweir.

<P>Crystallising his own "overriding sensation of being Out Of Place", Said
says: "My story was complicated, because the names were all wrong.  Not
everyone's identity is a simple story from A to Z. There are other
experiences and countries that feed into it." A polyglot, he dreams in both
English and Arabic, is fluent in French and literate in Spanish, German,
Italian and Latin.

<P>He left Palestine for the last time in 1947, just before thenakba , or
"catastrophe", of 1948 &#91;when the state of Israel was created out of the
territory of Palestine after a war with neighbouring Arab states&#93;, and
shared the "massive sense of loss and dispossession that over the years
clarified itself into a narrative into which mine fits".  Although his
family was, he says, driven out and lost all its property, it was cushioned
by the business in Egypt, and Said has never claimed to have been a
refugee. But his Aunt Nabiha worked for refugees in Cairo. "I had a
protected upbringing, but through my aunt I learned the importance of
service, which is what the Palestinian cause always meant to me," he says.

<P>While Said sees the latest effort to discredit him as "part of the
attempt not to let us have a narrative" - harking back to Golda Meir's
assertion in 1969 that "There are no Palestinians" - his memoir implicitly
forms part of the resistance: the insistent retelling from scratch of the
other side of the story.

<P>All the worlds of his childhood were lost to him through political
upheaval - Palestine, pre-civil war Lebanon, cosmopolitan Cairo, where his
classmates included Jews, Copts, Armenians and Muslims. But he feels he was
saved from nostalgia by the deflating realities of family life; more, he
says, Butler's Way of All Flesh than Proust.

<P>The eldest child, with four sisters, he says his mother cultivated an
exclusive intimacy with each child in "bilateral relationships as colony to
metropole", a manipulative technique he blames for "creating rifts between
me and my sisters that continue to this day". He also remembers with horror
"tremendous sexual repression". His mother blocked his marriage to his
Lebanese first love, Eva, by warning her against him. His father's
"Victorian design" was to correct his incorrigible "naughtiness" with
sports and extra lessons. To this day, says Said, he has no concept of
leisure or sense of cumulative achievement and he's never learned to relax
fully.

<P>"I have no blue-collar tastes, like watching sports on TV or fishing, my
son says=2E I fall asleep at movies and I don't enjoy nature at all.  But I
love the sea - which to me means the Mediterranean - and my idea of
pleasure is to play the piano."

<P>Surprisingly, Said grew up in an apolitical household, "cosseted and
buffeted" in a "gigantic cocoon". Though he belonged to "a tiny Protestant
group within a much larger Greek Orthodox Christian minority within the
larger Sunni majority", he feels he grew up in a Muslim culture, "unable to
feel any identification with Christianity as threatened by Islam", despite
growing sectarianism among Levantine Christians. But the memoir reveals the
tensions of being an Arab with a western education, shaped by the "three
empires" of Britain, France and the US. At Victoria College in Cairo, the
"Eton of the Middle East" (where Omar Sharif was head boy), Arabic was
banned. Expelled "for being a troublemaker" and banished to a "puritanical"
school in Massachusetts in 1951, he found himself alone among native-born
Americans.

<P>He describes an "unsettled sense of many identities, mostly in conflict
with each other, all my life". As he says elsewhere: "To be at the same
time Wog and Anglican was to be in a state of standing civil war", a
predicament replicated as a Palestinian Arab in America. But he says: "I
realised it wasn't necessary to try to reconcile these contradictions, but
to have them within you as a potential, not a problem. Belonging to both
sides of the imperial divide enables you to understand them more easily."

<P>Initially "tormented", Said felt an affinity with Conrad, the subject of
his first book - as with other "stubborn autodidacts and intellectual
misfits" - for his "loss of home and language". He says: "I became more and
more interested in the construction of identities, and how rich a field it
was." He became politically aware of himself as an Arab at Princeton during
the 1956 Suez crisis and the emergence of Arab nationalism under Nasser,
and at Harvard during the six-day Arab-Israeli war of 1967.

<P>The shattering Arab defeat was, he says, the "dislocation that subsumed
all other losses" and gave birth to the Palestinian movement, though his
parents disapproved of his growing political involvement ("You're a
literary professor, stick to that"). Said recalls the "re-emergence of the
Palestian spirit and the stunned discovery to find in its ranks so many
friends, memories deferred and suppressed" as a time of intellectual
discovery. "Beirut, where the PLO was in the 70s, was a world centre for
liberation move ments. I discovered Fanon and met Algerians and South
Africans. I began to be open to people from Asia, Africa, Latin America."

<P>In his 1968 essay The Arab Portrayed, Said linked representation with
power, exposed the caricature of the Arab as terrorist or sheikh, and
criticised Zionist myths of an unpeopled Palestine. Ibrahim Abu-Lughod,
who commissioned the piece, a Palestinian-American friend from Princeton
now at Bir Zeit university in the West Bank, says: "It was the first
opening to an alternative view in the US to the Zionist story. The
presentation of Arabs as backward, militant and governed by dictators was
used to justify and applaud their devastation by Israel, which imagined
Palestine as an empty desert, the Arab as a shadow."

<P>In a talk in New York last year, Between Worlds, Said described being by
the mid-70s in "the rich and unenviable position of speaking for two
diametrically opposed constituencies, one western, the other Arab"=2E He
began to write "contrapuntally, using the dis parate halves of my
experience, as an Arab and American, to work with and against each
other"=2E His 1978-81 trilogy on the relationship between the Arab and
Islamic world and the west - Orientalism, The Question Of Palestine and
Covering Islam - borrowed from Foucault and Raymond Williams but made
imperialism central. Ruling others was made possible by the cultural
representation of the ruled, from the 18th-century novel to CNN. Said also
saw the Palestinian plight in terms of the universal "problem of the
Other", believing that "if you wish to uphold basic human justice, you must
do so for everyone".

<P>In his later Culture And Imperialism, he extended his ambit from the
Arab world to other colonised areas, breathtakingly rereading the western
canon from Conrad, Kipling, Camus and Flaubert to Robinson Crusoe, the
Tempest and Verdi's Aida. Most controversially, he dared to suggest that
the apparent moral rectitude of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park rested on the
slave plantation. Through anti-colonial writers such as CLR James, Frantz
Fanon and Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, he also told the other side of the
story, their "writing back" to the metropolitan centre being what Said
calls "the voyage in".

<P>Though he loves the literature he reinterprets, and argues against a
rhetoric of blame, Said is sometimes rebuffed for presumption. He once
translated an essay by his admired Erich Auerbach, but when he sought the
estate's permission to collect Auerbach's essays, his son refused. Said
recalls with a trace of sadness: "He said myviews were political anathema
to him and would have been to his father."

<P>The Gulf war began as he was finishing Culture And Imperialism, which he
ends with a critique of Desert Storm, "the most covered and least reported
war in history". Furthering his argument in Covering Islam that insulting
Islam is "the last acceptable form of denigration of foreign culture in
the west", he saw the Gulf war as a paradigm of America's cultural war on
the Arabs: "Bomb them, humiliate them, lie about them." In a post-cold
war atmosphere where the "red peril" has given way to hysteria about the
"Islamic threat", the professor had 25 calls from the media asking him to
"explain" the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, before a home-grown terrorist
was fingered as the culprit.

<P>Yet Said, who feels he "belongsto both worlds, without being completely
of either one or the other", is against reductive stereotypes on both
sides, or Manichean stands between"us" and "them". He writes:  "Partly
because of empire, all countries are involved in one another; none is
single and pure, all are hybrid, heterogeneous". While he recognises
"defensive nationalism", he is suspicious of the rigid-identity politics of
"drum-beating roots affirmation", believing in the "inherent
irreconcilability between intellectual belief and passionate loyalty to
tribe, sect and country." Identity, he says, should not be "over and above
knowing about others".

<P>While his memoir hints at the seeds of his thought, it skates lightly
over sexual relationships. Married for almost 30 years to his Lebanese-born
wife Mariam, Said says half in jest that he ended the book in 1962 so as
not to discuss his first wife. Of that marriage to Maire Jaanus, an
Estonian-German who also became a Columbia professor, he says: "There's a
symbolic dimension to it. I married a European. We had nothing in common.
She was very beautiful and incredibly brilliant, studied at Vassar,
Harvard, Cambridge. It was a great ordeal."

<P>He does speak of an unnamed American woman, a "Diana figure" who
represented an "ideal America I couldn't gain admission to". He explains:
"It was tied up with being out of place in America; a liaison with an
insider in American society. Though I had a western education, it was a
society I never felt I could join. In my wanderings I've been fascinated
with that sort of person everywhere, looking at them to see how they
belong, which is something I've never had except as a child in Palestine,
when I wasn't aware of belonging. They're in the 'right place'
unselfconsciously, in a way I've secretly envied."

<P>Yet Said praises exile, and "the process of intellectual discovery
which relative rootlessness gives you", without ever glibly glossing over
its pain or the cushioning effect of privilege. He no longer has the need
to feel "at home". Although he enjoys New York "where I shall be until I
die", as a "gateway city that's so much part of the world", he says: "I
still feel New York isn't home. I don't know where home is, but it
certainly isn't here."

<P>Preparing for a Labour Day vacation with his wife, he describes his
"sleepless near-panic", and his tendency, "like all Palestinians", to
overpack. "It's a panic about not coming back, because of my first big
departure to America, or maybe earlier," he says. "Last night I dreamt of
losing my carry-on bag, which contains all my essentials - my Filofax and
spectacles. But I constantly organise trips." It is also, he says, a fear
of being "defenceless, stateless".

<P>Although Said's father and sisters travelled on US passports, his
mother's Palestinian laisser-passer always held her up at borders, till
she gained Lebanese citizenship in 1958. When his mother was ill in
Washington, there was an attempt to deport her because her visa had
expired. "The judge listened aghast, and threw the case out. He said to the
officials, 'you guys must be monsters'. A week later my mother died.
She'd say, 'I want to go home.' I'd ask, 'Where's home?'. But she couldn't
answer."

<P>In 1992 Said returned to Jerusalem for the first time in over 40 years,
with his son Wadie, a lawyer, and daughter Najla, an actress. He now
makes frequent trips. After his BBC film marking Israel's 50th anniversary
last year, In Search of Palestine, which passionately excoriated the
"peace process" for creating apartheid "bantustans" and allowing more
Jewish settlements, Said feels the timing of the latest attack on him was
"to discredit my memoir and me as a witness and a spokesman". In the run-up
to a final settlement, and amid Palestinian calls for compensation and
their right to return, he says: "They think, if they can call me a liar and
a fraud, who's to say those poor peasants are telling the truth."

<P>Yet Justus Reid Weiner, an American resident in Jerusalem, was for 12
years an official in the Israeli justice ministry, one of whose tasks was
to defend the security forces in the occupied territories from Amnesty
International. The obscure Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs, which paid
Weiner for his three-year research, is principally funded by Michael
Milken, the former junk bond dealer jailed in 1991 for insider trading.
Commentary, a "neo-conservative" magazine, had a previous effort at
slandering Said 10 years ago, when it labelled him "professor of terror",
despite his consistent rejection of terrorism or a military solution. And
the Daily Telegraph's publisher, Conrad Black, also owns the Jerusalem
Post, which supports the rightwing Likud party of former prime minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.

<P>Rebuttals have flowed in, from Said's teachers, relatives and
schoolmates. According to Said, those testimonies that ran counter to
Weiner's purpose he ignored, not least denying there was evidence that he
attended St George's Anglican Cathedral school in Jerusalem. Haig
Boyadjian, an Armenian from Jerusalem now resident in New Jersey, says that
when contacted by Weiner in February he clearly affirmed Said as a
classmate. He dismisses Weiner's claims as "absolute rubbish".

<P>Said, though, is scornful of the suggestion that he wields great power
in the media. "The mainstream press makes use of you when it wants to, as a
token or a symbol, but you have no access," he says. No major US paper, he
adds, would publish his response to Weiner, though it appears in the Arab
press, for which he has written regularly since 1993. It has been published
in Hebrew this week in the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'aretz.

<P>For him, the attack was recognition of his growing currency within
Israel, where even far-right Zionists, he believes, are "less rabid and
more in touch with reality" than in the US. He has long pleaded for both
sides to recognise the other's history, and having now abandoned hope of a
separate state, advocates equal citizenship in a "one-state solution". He
says: "The politics of separation can't work in the Middle East. The land's
too small. Our history's so mixed." He says the irony is that Weiner has
surfaced just as Israeli textbooks have been revised to admit dispossession
and massacres.

<P> Israel Shahak, an Israeli human rights activist and Holocaust survivor,
says of Said: "Not only can he crystallise the tragic situation of the
Palestinian people but he does it in a manner that the Israeli Jewish elite
can understand and respect. He's by far the most respected Arab
intellectual in Israel." Orientalism, in which Said likens the false
representations of the Arab and the Muslim to anti-semitism, is being
translated into Hebrew.

<P>Daniel Barenboim, conductor of the Berlin Staatsoper and a friend since
1992, describes Said as a "Renaissance apparition in these times of
specialisation" with an "indefinable moral authority". He adds: "We agree
the time has come, whatever the past, to make contacts between peoples and
not wait for political solutions." Said attended Barenboim's masterclasses
in Weimar last month with 90 young Arab and Israeli musicians. Said says:
"There were Arabs who'd never met Israelis before, and Israelis who'd never
met Palestinians. It began with tension, but it quickly disappeared" -
aided by his 10-year-old great-nephew, a piano prodigy from Amman.

<P>Seamus Deane thinks Said's anger helps keeps him going; what
Christopher Hitchens called, after Conrad, his "magnanimous indignations".
Perhaps too his relish at his "lonely vocation" as a "secular critic".
Asked if it's hard to be reviled not only by staunch Zionists but by
Palestinians who back the Oslo and 1998 Wye River accords, Said smiles
impishly and confesses: "But I enjoy it. It does concentrate the mind."

<P>In his memoir he likens living with the "sword of Damocles" of his
illness to surviving exile. He says: "When you find circumstances are too
much, that they're weighted against you and you're in an unfriendly camp,
there are always reserves, some stubborn faculty of resistance wells up and
you hold on. You realise you have more allies than you think, that the
other side might seem monolithic but it's not. It's not self-confidence but
an instinctive holding on, a love of life."
