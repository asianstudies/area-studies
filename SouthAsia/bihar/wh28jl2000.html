<b>The Making of Laloo Yadav: The Unmaking
of Bihar

<br>By Sankarshan Thakur</b>, <i>HarperCollins, Rs 295</i>

<p>Much has been written about Laloo Prasad
Yadav in the ten years he has dominated the
political life of Bihar. But no one, however
good the occasional vignettes in the daily press
or the weekly news magazines, has achieved
the degree of critical sensitivity in defining
Laloo Yadav as a populist politician and
failed chief minister as has Sankarshan Thakur
in <i>The Making of Laloo Yadav: The
   Unmaking of Bihar</i>.

<p>This is not academic scholarship but in terms
of its revealing thoroughness, this is a tour de
force of reportorial writing. In saying this, one
might wonder parenthetically why Laloo
Yadav&acute;s remarkable trajectory across India&acute;s political firmament in this decade has been so little studied in the academy. Where are the political scientists and the historians when we need them?

<p>After a brief initial phase when he was viewed
as a rustic buffoon, Laloo after all was
winning parliamentary and assembly elections
in Bihar by dramatic margins. And by the
middle Nineties, he was a major player at the
Centre where prime ministers were being
made and unmade. Indeed, as Thakur makes
clear, it was Laloo Yadav&acute;s unqualified
support for V.P. Singh in 1989 that was critical
in the political ascent of the Raja of Manda to
the prime ministership, and to Laloo&acute;s rise to the <i>gaddi</i> in Bihar and ultimately the
presidency of the Janata Dal. Whether in
populist jest or serious intent, Laloo was, alas,
proclaiming to his constituents in the 1996
parliamentary campaign that he could make
himself available for the highest elective office
in the land. As it turns out for better or worse,
for India and Bihar, that was not to be.

<p>There was a small matter emerging into wider
public consciousness in 1996, already well
known in Bihar as the fodder scandal, which in
the end would become a metaphor for the very
nature of Laloo Yadav&acute;s chief ministership,
and to use Thakur&acute;s apt phrase, the unmaking
of Bihar.

<p>In short, what the fodder scandal revealed was
a state system in a condition of systemic
dysfunction, literally across the board. Thakur
provides in these pages a damning critique of a
revolution for social justice and empowerment
of the exploited backward classes gone wrong.
Though Laloo was hardly the first to give
voice to the oppressed, Thakur gives him full
and legitimate credit for representing the poor
and the powerless in a populist message of
self-respect and political assertion.

<p>If it was a message that had been heard before,
it had never before been expressed with quite
the populist brilliance which Laloo brought to
the effort. It was a message that gave voice to
the oppressed, no doubt, but for Laloo Yadav,
the ultimate goal was to assure the
empowerment of Laloo Yadav.

<p>The cynical twist in the story is that
maintaining Laloo Yadav in power became the
only goal, inevitably to the detriment not only
of his backward classes and Muslim vote
bank, but for the 100 million citizens of India
who are Biharis. The specific beneficiaries of
Laloo raj are his intimate associates, most
often his caste fellows, family, friends,
contractors, and if one is to believe press
reports, many of the mafia dons and criminal
gangs of Bihar whom he is said to patronize,
all of whom in effect have become alternate
centres of power in an environment where
normal structures of governance and
administration were being undermined. What
has been called &#147;jungle raj&#148; with reference to this emerging pattern and the absence of law and order, or anything approximating an
effective policing system, might more
accurately be described as &#147;chamcha raj&#148;, the
rule of cronies and hangers-on of the main
man, Laloo Yadav.

<p>It is this pattern of highly personalized one man rule, quite independent of the normal
mechanisms of administration which permits
Thakur to refer to Laloo Yadav as a feudal
lord. By this reading, he is chief minister as
feudal lord with no sense or interest in the
ultimate purpose of government, namely to
govern. For Laloo Yadav, the very concept of
infrastructural development is a joke as he has
made clear time and time again. The result of
course is that there is no policy and no
development, meaning that all economic
indicators have been in precipitous decline
over the decade of the Nineties.

<p>The fiscal system is in a state of collapse,
which in turn makes possible a fodder scandal,
and an infinite number of other scandals.
Thakur reports that thousands of crores of
Central government development funds
directed to Bihar are unused, year after year. A
secretary to Laloo&acute;s government laments this
as criminal, but nobody could do a thing. In
mid-July of this year, the comptroller and
auditor general of India has made the same
charge. And a similar state of chaos exists in
other critical areas, whether in medicine, as
the response to the recent plane crash
revealed, or education, or power, or roads,
and so on ad infinitum.

<p>Nothing confirms Thakur&acute;s point about Laloo and the unmaking of Bihar more poignantly
than Laloo Yadav&acute;s response to the prime
minister&acute;s conference of July 15, on
information technology and the
computerization of India. What is information
technology? What has it done? I am opposed to
it, he was quoted as saying. What good are
science and technology other than rendering
skilled people useless. What technology? The
coal will remain ours. We will take out the
amount of coal we need and we are doing that.
The Centre, the police and the officials are
stealing and looting coal, and so on. In the
meantime, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
other states, are moving forward to employ the
revolutionary new technology in the interest of
all of their citizens, especially those less
privileged.

<p>The tragedy of Bihar is precisely that the poor, unlettered and backward citizens of Bihar,
who stand to benefit most from the new
technology, are made to believe by Laloo
Yadav&acute;s fear of the unknown and his Luddite
vision of the 21st century that remaining
backward is an acceptable expression of
assertion. It is not the first time in human
history such logic has been employed to keep
people on the farm.

<p>It is a logic which stands the related concepts
of izzat, development and a more generous
quality of life squarely on their head. It is after all serious governance, development and
everything that means in the year 2000, which
might have given substance to ideas of equity
and social justice to all of the citizens of
Bihar. Regrettably, this logic is not a part of
Laloo Yadav&acute;s conceptual, social, or political lexicon. But the results of the 1996, 1998, and 1999 parliamentary elections, and the 2000 assembly elections, all of which showed Laloo
Yadav&acute;s Rashtriya Janata Dal losing seats,
suggest that the citizen voters of Bihar may be
responding in different terms. That is their
hope.

<p>Sankarshan Thakur&acute;s remarkable book helps us understand why that should be the case. It is a
book that all observers of Bihar and of the
Laloo phenomenon, especially those in the
remote urban reaches of Delhi, Calcutta and
other centres of political reflection should
consider required reading. Sadly, the citizens
of Bihar know the story only too well.
