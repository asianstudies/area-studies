CHRISTOPHER V. HILL. <i>River of Sorrow: Environment and Social Control in Riparian North
India, 1770-1994</i>. (Monograph and Occasional Paper Series, number 55.) Ann Arbor, Mich.:
Association for Asian Studies. 1997. Pp. xii, 200. $33.00.<p>

This is a short book that covers both a large expanse of territory in the Purnia district in Northeast
India and a lengthy tract of time from the late eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. Written by
Christopher V. Hill with considerable passion, it adds greatly to our understanding of a number of
aspects of British rule and attempted environmental controls in India. Hill reveals the considerable
difficulties associated with the dramatically shifting river systems of the affluents of the Ganges,
which flow south from the Himalayas. Systems of tenure, ownership, or exploitation suitable for
more stable landscapes simply did not-and do not-work there. But connected with these
ecological instabilities there were other social and political ones. Governments like to define
populations as well as land. In this case, people were as difficult to map as the tracts. Allegedly
criminal groups sought refuge there, and the British viewed it as a regrettable sink for the
disaffected of adjacent areas. Settlement systems repeatedly broke down, not least because the
land moved into and out of cultivation according to the patterns of the river. Finally, the Purnia
district's reputation for ill health and for social, political, and ecological anarchy ensured that it
was regarded by British officials as a punishment station to be avoided at all costs. Despite its
reputation for good hunting, normally a recommendation in India, it suffered from a strikingly
high turnover of imperial staff. As Hill amply demonstrates, when officials change on almost 
an annual basis, the opportunities for securing not only policy continuity but also regional 
knowledge and memory are highly restricted.<p>

     Thus, this was a region where wild animals and untamed nature symbolized the limitations
of imperial rule. The environment contributed to that sense of the "limited Raj" that has become
increasingly common in the historiography of British rule in India. The allegedly monolithic,
all-powerful imperial power, the victim of its own propaganda and later of the simplifications of
the postcolonialists, was in fact hedged in by all sorts of constraints. Yet, according to Hill, the
British still tried to impose their "objectification and commodification of nature" into this unstable
landscape. They sought to extend their zamindari "permanent settlement" there, struggling
throughout their rule to create intermediary estate holders through whom they could control the
population and levy the land revenue. But even their own white planters became laws unto
themselves in the region, an unruly fragment as independent as the nomadic and supposedly
criminal groups whom the British struggled to define and control.<p>

     By the end of the book, the reader has a sense of Hill trying to have it both ways. The
British neither understood the region nor adequately controlled it. Their measures were certainly
inappropriate and inadequate, yet they are held responsible for continuing social and economic
problems fully fifty years after independence. Perhaps Indian national and provincial governments
have simply found the district as intractable as their British predecessors. The limited Raj has been
replaced by the equally limited powers and resources of democratic nationalism. One of the
striking, implicit conclusions that emerges from this book is the extraordinary extent to which the
British, however baleful the combination between their limited understanding and their efforts to
transfer European perceptions to lands where they were entirely inappropriate, nonetheless
fretfully compiled data and indulged in internal debates that offer considerable opportunities for
the historian. On the basis of such extensive documentation, India has acquired one of the most
sophisticated of all environmental historiographies. This book makes a significant contribution to
it and offers both a quarry and signposts for future researchers.<p align=right>
