   <b>STORMY BIHAR SESSION LIKELY ON
    AUDIT REPORT</b>  <p>
   
  
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT <p>
 
Patna, July 28  <br>
The Bihar Assembly is likely to witness stormy scenes over
the government’s reluctance to table the comptroller and
auditor-general (CAG)’s report on the state’s economy in its
monsoon session beginning on August 2. <p>

The report, submitted to the government recently, has cited
excess expenditure and other irregularities in almost all
departments. The government is apparently buying time to
table the report in view of the ensuing Lok Sabha polls and
the Assembly election slated for early next year. <p>

A government source said the finance ministry was yet to go
through the report. Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly
Sushil Modi said he would mount pressure on the government
to table the report from the first day of the session. He alleged
that even last year the CAG report was tabled only after
specific instructions from the Governor. <p>

The deplorable condition of the state’s economy came under
severe criticism recently when a finance commission team
visited the capital. The team, headed by chairman A. M.
Khusro, found that the government had spent only 40 per cent
of the funds allocated under the Eighth Plan. <p>

The team also found that the state was spending less than 50
per cent of the allocated funds every year despite presenting a
deficit budget and resorting to supplementaries. <p>

Citing an example, sources said although the state contingency
fund began with an allocation of just Rs 1 crore, over Rs 300
crore have been been spent with periodic revisions. However,
the state finance department is yet to regularise the Rs 209
crore lying unutilised since 1987-88. <p>

Financial experts are also worried about the sorry state of
public sector undertakings (PSUs) in the state. According to
finance department sources, 43 of the 50 PSUs are in the red.

Of these, 28 have been identified as "defunct" and only two
reaped marginal profits. The experts said of the 50 PSUs, 22
were not paying their employees regularly. The period for this
irregularity of payment ranged from three to six months.<p> 

The state government has also been criticised for not being
able to finalise project reports for some PSUs in consonance
with the Companies Act, resulting in functional bottlenecks. <p>

Sources said non-clearance of 535 accounts by the PSUs
have resulted in cumulative losses over Rs 1,000 crore against
assets investments of Rs 650 crore. The PSUs are waiting for
another loan instalment of Rs 1,400 crore.<p>

   <b>CONTRACT KILLERS HELD IN BIHAR </b> <p>
 
FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT <p>
 
Dhanbad, July 28  <br>
Four gangsters arrested from the Dhanbad taxi stand
yesterday said Jamshedpur, Bokaro and other industrial cities
in south Bihar are set to witness a spurt in killings before the
Lok Sabha polls. <p>

The accused, who are being interrogated by the police, said
hired killers would target well-known personalities to whip up
a fear psychosis. <p>

Initially, the police were not aware that four members of an
inter-state car-lifting gang arrested yesterday were dreaded
professional killers working for the Brajesh Singh and Dhumal
Singh gangs of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Interrogation revealed
their Uttar Pradesh links. Two of the arrested, Utpal Ghosh
and Prakash Mishra, have been identified by the police as ace
shooters of the Brajesh Singh gang. <p>

They are allegedly involved in a number of killings in
Jamshedpur and the coal belt. They are also wanted by the
Mumbai police in connection with the sensational J.J.Hospital
shootout. Investigating officers of the Dhanbad police, who
are interrogating the gangsters, said both Ghosh and Mishra
were at present residing in Bokaro steel city’s sector three
area. The other two have been identified as Mrityunjay Kumar
and Pappu Agarwal—both drivers and bodyguards of the late
underworld don, Shakaldeo Singh, who was gunned down in
January this year. <p>

Inspector-in-charge of Dhanbad police station A. Z. Kamal
said the criminals were on an assignment. Utpal Ghosh
confessed that he had arrived from Jamshedpur yesterday
itself. He said he met Brajesh Singh at Jamshedpur before
arriving here. 

Kamal said the gangsters first tried to hire a "new Maruti van"
from the taxi stand for Jamshedpur. As there were no new
vans, they settled for an Ambassador. <p>

Ghosh confessed that he took shelter in Shakaldeo Singh’s
house when the police were looking for him in connection with
a murder in Jamshedpur. <p>

Police sources feel that they had been hired for killing a
"big-shot" in Jamshedpur. The Dhanbad police has contacted
its counterparts in Uttar Pradesh for more information about
the gang. <p>

Poll stricture: Six senior Bihar officials, including three district
magistrates and two commissioners, have been transferred
and debarred from election-related duties in future on the
Election Commission’s directives, adds PTI. The commission
had found that these officers were lacking requisite skill in
election-related duties.<p>

 <b>‘PURNEA TERROR’ POISED FOR COMEBACK</b>  <p>
   
FROM TAPAS CHAKRABORTY <p>
 
Patna, July 27  <br>
Even the dank cells of the Beur jail have failed to daunt
controversial Janata Dal leader and former MP Pappu
Yadav’s dream of staging a political comeback. <p>

Dubbed as the terror of Purnea, the former gangster’s hopes
rest on the assumption that the electorate will ride the crest of
a sympathy wave to vote him back to power. <p>

"I will contest the Purnea seat and public sentiment will help
me sail through," Yadav said recently. He said no amount of
political machination by RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav would
be able to turn the tide against him. <p>

Pappu Yadav was arrested by the CBI in June in connection
with the murder of the CPM legislator from Purnea, Ajit
Sarkar. <p>

An alleged mafia don, Yadav had a running feud with the
CPM legislator as the latter had organised thousands of
landless labourers against the landlords in Purnea. Sitting
MLA Madhavi Sarkar, widow of the slain leader, alleged that
her husband was on Yadav’s hit list as he had exposed the
MP’s mafia links. <p>

According to the CBI, Yadav had hired sharp-shooter Ranjan
Tiwari to eliminate Sarkar on June 14, 1998. CBI
investigations revealed that Ranjan met an undertrial
Surajbhan Singh in Patna jail in January 1998 and Singh
reportedly asked Tiwari to work for Pappu and D.P. Yadav.
Pappu Yadav later met Tiwari in Delhi. <p>

CBI sources said Pappu Yadav and Tiwari went to Purnea
together in April where Tiwari put up with one of Pappu’s
relatives. He introduced himself as Ashok Mehta. After killing
Sarkar, Tiwari left for Siliguri, the CBI alleged. <p>

However, Pappu Yadav’s spirits continue to soar despite
being charged with political assassination. The don
co-ordinates his operation from behind bars and hundreds of
people from Munger throng the Beur jail everyday to keep
him posted on the developments in Purnea.<p> 

His still maintains contact with the Ananda Marg which
commands a formidable base in the Purnea-West Dinajpur
side of Bihar-Bengal border. Former Union minister Ram
Vilas Paswan and Sharad Yadav often call on him, fanning his
political ambition. Yadav is happy that the Janata Dal and the
Samata party have merged for it professes to "make things
easier for him."<p>

Yadav, who has a dozen criminal cases, murders and cases of
intimidation and illegal assembly pending against him, resents
being called a "don." "When you work for the poor, false
cases are filed against you to tarnish your image," Yadav said.
His first battle, however, is to obtain bail. <p>

Last week, he complained of high blood pressure and poor
heart condition and prayed to the court that he be shifted to a
hospital. The CBI, however, dismissed his plea. <p>

Hundreds of Janata Dal workers from Purnea staged a dharna
in the city recently to mount pressure on the RJD government
to grant him bail but this too failed to yield fruit. "There is no
concrete evidence against me to support the CBI charges.
The agency is politically motivated," he alleged. <p>

Despite his efforts to obtain bail before the polls, it may be a
rough ride ahead for Yadav. With the Samata Party-Janata
Dal merger, the BJP may not concede the Purnea seat to him
since his party has an MP from Munger. <p>

Observers said given his track record, even the Janata Dal
would be reluctant to field him from any constituency. In that
case, the only option for Yadav would be to contest as an
Independent candidate from Purnea.<p>

<b> LALOO, CONG IN SEAT TALKS </b> <p>
   
  
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT <p>
 
New Delhi, July 27  <br>
Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav today met
CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, his CPI
counterpart A. B. Bardhan and Congress leaders Madhav
Rao Scindia and Ahmed Patel to finalise electoral strategies in
Bihar. <p>

Though none of them disclosed the number of seats they
planned to clinch, sources close to the RJD chief said he was
inclined to leave 20 out of the 54 seats for the allies. <p>

He may leave 12 seats for the Congress, five for the CPI, two
to the CPM and one for the Marxist Coordination Committee.
Party sources ruled out any alliance with the Jharkhand Mukti
Morcha. <p>

However, the alliance partners are still bargaining for more.
Congress sources said, initially the party wanted up to 27
seats, while the CPI hoped for 13, having identified eight to
nine winning constituencies, while the CPM had picked four. <p>

Laloo Yadav told reporters that he had no differences with
Mulayam Singh Yadav. "We have cordial relations and both
parties are very much in the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha," he
said while hinting that the RJD might spare one or two seats
for the Samajwadi Party in Bihar. <p>

The RJP chief said he was hopeful of working out a
seat-sharing formula with the Congress and the Left parties by
the first week of August. He said it was the "historic
responsibility" to crush the "communal" forces led by the BJP.<p>

He added his priority was to ensure that non-BJP votes are
not split in Bihar. He predicted the BJP will be wiped out of
its stronghold in south Bihar and the rest of the state. <p>

Laloo Yadav said if veteran film actor Dilip Kumar, who was
targeted by the Shiv Sena, wanted to contest from Bihar, the
RJD would offer him any seat he wanted. He said he would
again contest from Madhepura. <p>

Both Laloo Yadav and working president Ranjan Yadav said
the Congress was "very reasonable" and that they did not find
any hitch in reaching an early agreement. Bardhan said though
there were difficulties over some constituencies, every effort
was being made to solve them. <p>

He played down the importance of the number of seats the
CPI would get by saying: "What is more important is how
many seats can be won by secular parties." <p>

He said the split in the Janata Dal, with its Bihar leader Ram
Vilas Paswan siding with the BJP-led National Democratic
Alliance, would not affect the RJD’s electoral prospects in the
state. "Where is the Janata Dal? Where is Samata in Bihar?"
he asked. <p>

Party secretary D. Raja said politically the CPI had agreed to
fight the BJP along with the RJD and that the problem of seat
adjustment will be sorted out. <p>

In the 1998 parliamentary elections, the CPI and CPM
contested separately and drew a blank. Asked how many
seats the CPI will contest in Bihar.<p>

 <b>LALOO LURES PASWAN AIDE</b><p>
    
   
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT <p>
  
 Patna, July 26  <br>
 RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav today hit back at his
 political adversary Ram Vilas Paswan by roping in one of the
 latter’s close aides, Sukhdeo Paswan, a former MP from
 Araria. <p>

 Paswan, who joined the RJD today, said his decision was
 prompted by his mentor’s truck with the BJP-Samata Party
 combine. He said he thought it prudent to join the RJD as
 some Janata Dal leaders had surrendered to communal forces.
 He also submitted a list of 35 Dal leaders from Araria near
 Purnea, who joined the RJD with him. <p>

 Political observers here said Paswan’s defection to the RJD
 was intended to drive home the message that after the merger
 with the Samata Party, the Janata Dal would cease to espouse
 the Dalit cause. <p>

 In his bid to expand his caste base, the RJD chief has been
 targeting influential backward caste leaders in the state. Koeri
 heavyweight and former MP Shakuni Chowdhary was the first
 leader to quit the Samata Party early this month and join the
 RJD. <p>

 Sukhdeo Paswan is the second most important Paswan leader
 in the RJD after Pitambar Paswan, the state unit president.
 Janata Dal sources said Sukhdeo Paswan was maintaining a
 low profile since he lost his seat to the BJP from Araria. Party
 insiders said he decided to quit after the Dal’s merger with the
 Samata Party because it was not possible for him to contest
 on a Janata Dal ticket. However his departure was a blow to
 the party, sources said. <p>

 Laloo Prasad Yadav today said since its inception in 1977,
 the Janata Dal had been divided on communal lines. Some of
 its leaders owed allegiance to both the Janata Dal and the
 BJP. <p>

 Citing an instance, he said Dal president Sharad Yadav had
 advised him not to stop L.K. Advani’s rath in Bihar despite
 political rivalry. <p>

 The RJD today demanded that the Wadhwa Commission
 report on the killing of Australian missionary, Graham Stewart
 Staines, be made public. <p>

 Laloo stand <p>

 RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav today reiterated that he
 was not ready to concede the south Bihar seats to Congress.
 "We will fight the seats together," he said, reports our Patna
 correspondent.<p>
