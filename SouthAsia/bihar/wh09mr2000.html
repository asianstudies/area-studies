 It was the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November
 1948, the day Americans traditionally go to the polls to elect
 their president. The Democratic candidate was the incumbent,
 Harry S. Truman, who had succeeded to the office in April
 1945, at the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. <p>

 But Truman was no Roosevelt, and in 1948 it was widely
 thought that new leadership was needed to guide the country
 into the post-war years. Thomas E. Dewey, the popular
 Republican governor of New York, was the overwhelming
 favourite. In fact, the Republican establishment and their
 conservative media supporters were so confident that <i>The
 Chicago Tribune</i> published a victory edition that very evening
 in grand anticipation, announcing in banner headlines, "Dewey
 Wins". But then as now it was the people who voted and not
 the press and the pollsters, and the people�s choice in that
 election was of course Harry Truman. <p>

 In the more accurate press reports the following morning,
 Truman was shown gleefully waving <i>The Chicago Tribune,</i> 
"Dewey Wins," edition over his head. The applicable
 metaphor here, as Dewey and the Republicans learned to their
 great regret, was that revealing fable from the classical Greek,
 "Don�t count your chickens before they are hatched." <p>

 It is a metaphor the leadership of the National Democratic
 Alliance and its Bharatiya Janata Party, Samata Party, and
 Janata Dal (United) constituents might well have contemplated
 to their advantage in the run up to the recent assembly
 elections in Bihar. Had they done so and been less concerned
 with bickering over the loaves and fishes of office which their
 misplaced confidence inspired, Bihar might have been spared
 much of the poignant drama of the days since the results were
 announced. <p>

 Not only were NDA expectations badly confounded, but
 equally those of the Congress, and the Communist Party of
 India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) left
 alliance, which were inevitably anticipating more substantial
 numbers and the enhanced anti-NDA bargaining position that
 would have provided. <p>

 If the final results had even begun to approach the opinion poll
 figures of 175 to 180 for the NDA (leave alone their own
 "computer generated" estimates of 218 seats), there would
 long since have been a new government functioning in Patna.
 But the likelihood of Nitish Kumar being the chief
 minister-designate in those circumstances would have been
 minimal indeed. Failing these results, the reality we have
 before us was almost inevitable. <p>

 In other words, the NDA combine with its 122 seats did
 much worse than expected, and Laloo Prasad Yadav and the
 Rashtriya Janata Dal did much better than the opinion poll
 estimates which ranged from 65 to 100 at the most optimistic. <p>

 But given the persistent and continuing anti-Laloo sentiment
 that is abroad among the electorate (reflected among other
 things in a marginally lower voting percentage from 1999, now
 estimated at 28 per cent), the 124 seats for the RJD, or 126
 for the RJD-Communist Party of India (Marxist) combine, are
 presumably the limits of Laloo�s support base in the year
 2000, 10 years after he initially assumed office. (The Laloo
 Janata Dal had 120 seats in 1990, when Laloo became chief
 minister with the strong support of his then ally, Nitish
 Kumar.) <p>

 In retrospect it is of course easy to explain what happened.
 The NDA leadership naively assumed that the dramatic
 successes of the 1999 party election would automatically
 translate to comparable successes in the assembly elections.
 In this state of heightened expectation, seat sharing became a
 matter of competition rather than accommodation. The
 problem was never fully resolved, with rebel candidates and
 independents standing against official nominees in enough
 constituencies to have affected the end result. <p>

 Rather than projecting a unified coalition and a unified
 coalition leader as they did in 1999, the NDA constituents
 were in fact badly divided. That they issued their common
 platform barely 48 hours before the first day of polling, when
 Election Commission rules require that campaigning end,
 reinforced the image of confusion. And perhaps most critically
 and quite inexplicably, they badly underestimated the political
 skills of their only real opponent. <p>

 Laloo Prasad Yadav remains the most artful populist politician
 of the 20th century, and he literally pulled out all the stops in
 pleading with an electorate for forgiveness and support. He
 played the role of the humble Laloo brilliantly, for example,
 allowing that if it was development (for him an oxymoron) they
 wanted, he would give it to them. Although his votes and seats
 were down dramatically from 1995 (from 165 to 124, or a 25
 per cent decline; the NDA constituents were up from 63 seats
 to 122, that is an increase of 93 per cent), it was a tactic that
 kept his declining base intact, much to everyone�s surprise,
 especially that of the NDA. <p>

 One can conclude from these results that the voters of Bihar
 know their minds well. If they have delivered a fractured
 verdict, they did so with clinical intent. They have had 10
 years of Laloo Prasad Yadav, whose RJD government was
 defined in the CPI(M-L) election manifesto as "an apology for
 institutionalized anarchy". It is an anarchy the citizen voters of
 Bihar propose to change. They seek some semblance of
 governance which attends at least minimally to basic needs
 like roads, water, electricity, education, medicine, and
 fundamentally, the law and order of a civil society. <p>

 That is the message they have sent in these elections to all
 politicians who have for so long taken them for granted,
 whether of the RJD, or, as in the recent elections, the NDA.
 And for the moment they are perfectly content to let them all
 twist slowly in the wind, wondering when and whether they
 will assume office. The response of the politicians in these
 circumstances is one of convincing, cajoling, and enforcing
 alliances, splits, and defections in anticipation of the
 forthcoming vote of confidence. <p>

 The parties that engage in these efforts to generate support are
 said to be negotiating over "common minimum programmes",
 while their opponents� efforts are described as "horse
 trading". Whatever the case, the acrimony, and, sadly, the
 violence since the governor, V.C. Pande, tapped Nitish
 Kumar to prove his majority on the floor of the assembly has
 been extreme even for Bihar. <p>

 The RJD bandh of last weekend and after has resulted in at
 least eight deaths, six when a locomotive collided with a
 breakdown repair van on the East Central Railway in north
 Bihar. The van was returning from replacing fish plates which
 had been removed by RJD supporters of the bandh.
 Hundreds have been injured. Railway services and
 telecommunications have been severely disrupted in much of
 Gangetic north India. <p>

 It is difficult to see these actions as "Gandhian" civil
 disobedience as claimed, or for that matter as anyway
 appropriate in a secular, civil polity. In most democratic
 societies they would be considered as endangering life and
 property and open to criminal prosecution. <p>

 It is of course entirely reasonable to question the constitutional
 propriety of the governor�s action, though it must be noted
 that the framers of the Constitution were silent on this matter,
 and one must presume, for reasons they considered important.
 Contrariwise, at a time of one party dominance, it is entirely
 possible that the framers might not have foreseen the kinds of
 narrow divisions this time of transition to coalition politics has
 produced. <p>

 However that may be, the governor, who was reported to be
 "consulting constitutional authorities" throughout, was well
 within the discretionary powers available to him to invite
 anyone he felt could provide a stable government. It is a point
 made on Sunday last by Digvijay Singh, the Congress chief
 minister of Madhya Pradesh, differing rather dramatically with
 the party leadership in New Delhi on this issue. <p>

 Indeed, it may well have been the delay in the Congress
 conveying its support of the RJD on Thursday and Friday of
 last week that moved the governor to act. And that delay may
 itself have been motivated by indecisiveness both in New
 Delhi and in Patna on the wisdom of that support, in the face
 of strong opposition from the Bihar wing of the party and the
 180 degree policy turn this position represented. <p>

 It must also be noted here that Pande comes from an Indian
 Administrative Service background with a reputation for
 impeccable integrity. He was the revenue secretary under
 Rajiv Gandhi and the cabinet secretary under V.P. Singh.
 How the ambiguities thrown up by the assembly election are
 resolved will be demonstrated sooner than later on the floor of
 the house. <p>

 At the moment of writing this, the situation is fluid in the
 extreme and the results in either direction are problematic. No
 one is more adept at engineering defections and breaking
 parties than Laloo Yadav, as he has demonstrated again and
 again over the 10 years of his incumbency. I make the point
 only as an observation and not a prediction, for all parties and
 players are obviously equally determined. And if there is no
 resolution on the floor of the house, the citizen voters of Bihar
 will express themselves yet again, and more pointedly one
 presumes, at the ballot box. <p>

 These events recall the aphorism of Abraham Lincoln, that
 great American president of the people, when he said in 1864:
 "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and you can
 fool some of the people all of the time, But you cannot fool all
 of the people all of the time." It is a message Nitish Kumar or
 Laloo Yadav should take very seriously. <p>

 As the results of the assembly election show, the citizen voters
 of Bihar are tired of waiting. <p>
