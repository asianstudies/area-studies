 BUOYANT LALOO PUTS DALITS</b><p>

FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT <p>
 
New Delhi, March 8<br>
A buoyant Laloo Prasad Yadav today ruled out early
Assembly elections in Bihar and declared the first priority of
the reinstated Rabri Devi government would be to uplift Dalits.<p>

As the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) government got a lease of
life, Laloo Yadav made a new promise — distribution of 400
acres of land among Dalits in Jehanabad, the district where
two massacres in less than a month had led to the sacking of
the Bihar government. <p>

Hours after home minister L.K. Advani announced the
revocation of President’s rule, Laloo Yadav marched down to
the lawn outside Parliament where Mahatma Gandhi’s statue
stands, garlanded it and said the reinstatement of the Rabri
government was a tribute to International Women’s Day. <p>

Later, he addressed a press conference inside Parliament,
signalling his intention to govern better. Heeding the Left’s
criticism of the complete absence of land reforms in Bihar, the
RJD chief declared his first task would be to distribute land
and focus on development activities — matters that never
really figure on his agenda. <p>

Since the Jehanabad massacres and the subsequent axe on the
Rabri government had put the Dalit issue at the centre of the
debate on President’s rule in Bihar, Laloo harped on his duty
towards Dalits. “I will go on a padayatra with Rabri Devi to
Jehanabad," he said. <p>

The ruling BJP and its ally Samata Party had tried to brand
Laloo Yadav and his allies as “anti-Dalit", and the RJD chief
today signalled his resolve not to let the accusation to stick. <p>

He focused on Dalits, land reforms and development, in that
order, to take the wind out of the Opposition campaign. 

In his hour of victory, the Bihar satrap turned generous
towards his traditional political adversaries — the CPI(ML),
which has taken a lead in organising the landless poor in
central Bihar. <p>

“I will release from prison the Naxalites who have been falsely
incriminated. But they also must give up terrorism," he said. 

The entire Opposition, including the Congress and the Left,
had rallied behind Laloo Yadav in his hour of crisis and he
effusively thanked his friends in need. He had a special word
of gratitude for Congress president Sonia Gandhi. <p>

During the crisis, Laloo Yadav had mopped up allies and
buried the hatchet with the Congress and Left — parties
which had been extremely critical of his functioning. 

“I am indebted to Sonia Gandhi," he said and then individually
named all Left, Janata Dal, Tamil Maanila Congress and
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leaders who had spoken up on
his government’s behalf in the Lok Sabha. <p>

The RJD chief also made it a point to underline that Janata Dal
leader Ram Vilas Paswan was not among those who had
befriended him. “I thank all Opposition leaders minus Ram
Vilas Paswan," he said. <p>

 BOOK REVIEW/SIN, SAINTS AND CINEMA</b><p>
 
 BY ANIL GROVER <p>
 
 CINEMA AND THE INDIAN FREEDOM
 STRUGGLE <br>
 By Gautam Kaul, 
 Sterling, Rs 600 <p>

 Mohandas Karamchand Gan- dhi considered cinema “sinful
 technology". Asked to fill in a questionnaire sent to him by the
 Indian cinematograph committee, he rejected the request
 saying, “Even if I was so minded, I should be unfit to answer
 your questionnaire as I have never been to a cinema. But even
 to an outsider the evil that it has done and is doing is patent.
 The good if it has done at all, remains to be proved.<p>

 Gandhi’s aversion to cinema is confirmed by his statement in
 Harijan (May 3, 1942): “If I began to organise picketing in
 respect of them [the evil of cinema] I should lose my caste, my
 mahatmaship." Ironically, the Mahatma was documented on
 celluloid during his lifetime and later by Richard Attenborough,
 who gave the spartanly clad father of the nation a new coat of
 iconic paint in his record breaking, Oscar winning film,
 Gandhi. <p>

 Although Gandhi was allowed to see Vijay Bhatt’s Ram
 Rajya for just 20 minutes by his physician, Sushila Nayyar, he
 was interested enough to sit through the entire film, whose
 publicity, in those days, had cost as much as Rs 200,000. But
 apparently even this made no difference to his dislike of
 cinema, for he was impervious to its importance in this land of
 tamashas and raths. <p>

 Gautam Kaul’s pioneering work takes a wide angle look at
 cinema in the subcontinent since it first came to India with the
 monsoon of 1896. At least a couple of works in the regional
 language may have preceded Kaul’s, but he is the first to
 negotiate the wider expanses of this medium of mass
 entertainment and come up with a chestfull of nuggets, linking
 the new entertainment with decades of political movements. <p>

 The book does not, however, set out to be an infallible
 encyclopaedia though it does include a very useful filmography
 of “freedom films", arranged both alphabetically, along with
 the credits, and in order of decades, from 1921 to 1996. The
 book also contains political lyrics and a whole lot of
 fascinating and rare photographs, stills, posters and
 advertisements. The chapter on regional cinema is split into
 short overviews, allowing for quick reference in an otherwise
 “heavy" book. <p>

 Kaul has kept the language rather linear, and though it lacks
 stylistic fireworks and often smacks of officialese, it makes for
 compelling reading. This, despite the fact the book has quite a
 few factual and proofing errors. But considering the vastness
 of the vision, these and the rather tacky cover design, can be
 viewed with indulgence. <p>

 In perhaps the most interesting chapter, Kaul makes a detailed
 reference to the leadership of the freedom struggle and how it
 viewed cinema. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the first to be caught up
 by the “sinful technology", was keen to make commercial use
 of cinema and had proposed to Dadasaheb Phalke in 1918
 that he start the Hindustan cinema film company which could
 tie up with American producers to make films for export as
 well as the domestic market. Phalke spurned the proposal
 because he wanted to make films only on swadeshi themes.
 Tilak also wrote actively on Indian films in his paper, Kesari. <p>

 The first Indian litterateur to have the flicker of the projector
 catch his eye was none other than Rabindranath Tagore. The
 earliest short story of Tagore to be filmed was Manbhanjan
 (1923), directed by Naresh Mitra. His Bicharak (1929) was
 banned on charges of obscenity. Tagore tried directing himself
 with Natir Puja (1932) but gave it up because of technical
 complexities though he did play the role of an old monk in the
 film. Tagore also tried writing the scenario of his own play,
 Tapati, to be directed by Dhiren Ganguly, but that project
 was stillborn. <p>

 As early as 1900, Tagore also cut a gramophone disc with a
 rendition of Vande Mataram, which was manufactured by H.
 Bose’s Records. Interestingly, a copy of this disc could only
 be found 61 years later. <p>

<font size=+2><b>RJD Govt will be remembered for massacres</b></font><p>

<!-BYLINE-><b>By Sachchidanand Jha<P>

<!-BYLINE-></b></font><b>The Times of India News Service<P>

</b></font>PATNA: The nine-year rule of Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife Rabri Devi will be long remembered for massacres. With social justice being its main plank, the Laloo-Rabri rule gave backward castes and Dalits a voice and a kind of assertiveness never witnessed before March 1990, when charismatic Mr Yadav took over the reins of power in Bihar riding a wave of popularity.<P>
Still their government could not prevent ghastly killings of hundreds of Dalits in central and South Bihar. Starting with the Baathe massacre in Jehanababd district, in which an armed squad of Ranvir Sena, a banned private army of upper caste landlords, butchered 61 innocent Dalits on December 1, 1997, the 18-month-old Rabri regime has alone witnessed killing of more than a hundred Dalits so far. Rabri took over as chief minister on July 25, 1997.<P>
The state has witnessed about 7,000 rape incidents since 1990 with 1,585 reported in 1998 alone. Similarly, more than 55,000 murders have taken place during the last nine years with 5,235 taking place in the last year. This included murders of three MLAs, including that of firebrand CPM leader Ajit Sarkar. During the same year, 1,305 cases of kidnapping for ransom were recorded.<P>
In fact, it was the killing of 23 Dalits at Shankarbigha and 12 at Narainpur in Jehanabad district within a span of 17 days this year by the Sena which led to the imposition of President's Rule in the state on February 12. It was, however, revoked after 25 days.<P>
The state has also witnessed the Bara, Rampur Chauram, Rampur Aiyara, Usri Bazar and Bhimpura massacres of upper caste Bhumihars by militants over the period.<P>
Opposition parties, including the BJP, have charged Mr Yadav with extending patronage to both left and right wing extremist organisations to derive political mileage out of the caste war leading to massacres.<P>
<b>SCAMS GALORE: </b></font>The RJD national president Laloo Prasad Yadav himself ruled the state for seven years, four months and 15 days out of these nine years during which several scams rocked the state. These include Rs 1,153 crore fodder scam, Rs 400 crore bitumen scam, Rs 300 crore medicine scam, engineering examination racket and muster roll scam. All these scams are currently being investigated by the CBI.<P>
<b>DECLINE IN POPULARITY: </b></font>Laloo had the dubious distinction of twice being sent to jail in connection with two fodder scam cases in which he had been chargesheeted by the CBI. The unearthing of fodder scam in January 1996 led to sudden fall in the popularity of Mr Yadav even among his constituents, with Kurmis and Koeris, the two important backward castes, and a section of Dalits, shifting their loyalty to the BJP- Samata Party.<P>
<b>ECONOMY IN DISARRAY: </b></font>With Mr Yadav playing the Mandal card since October 1990 to woo backwards to broaden his mass base, the state administration started drifting and the state could never meet the annual plan target during the last nine years. Despite the foreign visits of Mr Yadav, no NRI came forward to make investment in the state due to poor law and order as well as poor infrastructural facilities.<P>

<!-SUBHED-><b><b>Similar Goals but Contrasting Styles<P>

</b></b></font><!-BYLINE-></b></font><b>By ANDRE BETEILLE<P>

</b></font>WHEN the country became independent, many Indians looked to the government to play a leading and beneficial role in transforming the collective life of the nation. The leaders of the nationalist movement had spoken and written tirelessly about what needed to be done to enable India to take its rightful place in the comity of nations. There had been one insuperable obstacle in the way, and that was the presence of an uncaring and oppressive colonial power. A national government would do everything that the colonial government had been unable or unwilling to do. <!-SUBHED-><b><b>Professional Laxity<P>
</b></b></font><P>
 </b></font>The conviction that a national government would play a major part in the regeneration of Indian society was very widespread among the Indian intelligentsia. Many of the brightest and the best students in the metropolitan universities aspired to careers in the civil service, not simply in the interest of personal gain, but also because they believed that such a career would enable them to lead fruitful and constructive lives. <P>
 The attitude to the government and to public service through the organs of government began to change, slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity after 1977. The trauma of the Emergency was followed by the disorder of the first non-Congress government in New Delhi. The post-Emergency period brought in a culture of public exposure whereby the misdeeds of the government and its functionaries began to be widely exposed, sometimes in an exaggerated form. This led to a general loss of esteem for the institutions of governance. It also reinforced the turpitude and venality that were already there among civil servants, for it is a truism that men behave badly when they lose their self-esteem when they are deprived of public esteem. <P>
 I was for many years a regular visitor to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie where I often discussed the state of the nation with the probationers and the course directors who were mostly members of the various services. From the late seventies onward, I detected a growing disenchantment with the services among the latter. I was told repeatedly that professional laxity and corruption had become endemic in the services. I sometimes found myself in the peculiar position of a university professor having to defend the Indian Administrative Service from trenchant attacks against it by its own members. <P>
 It was in Mussoorie that I first learnt about the good work being done by the NGOs, and the tremendous opportunities being opened up by them for public service in various fields. In the discussions there, a sharp contrast was often made between the dull and confined routine of the bureaucrat working for the government and the freedom and initiative of the social activist serving the NGO. Some civil servants resigned from the government to work for one or another NGO, and others set up their own NGOs on retirement. In this and other ways, the NGO has come to occupy an established place in public life in India.<P>
 Looking back on those discussions of 20 years ago, I am reminded of the dialectic of church and sect that has been a part of many religious traditions. In this dialectic, which has been extensively studied by sociologists of religion, the church has been viewed invariably as conservative and hierarchical, and the sect as radical and egalitarian. The distinction just noted has been especially emphasised by the founders of new sects.<P>
 Sects have had highly varied historical fortunes. Many have died or disappeared without leaving much trace. Some have grown and prospered. Their development from origin to maturity has shown certain common patterns across the different religions. Growth and prosperity have led, with unfailing regularity, to changes in both doctrine and organisation. With success, the sect becomes less doctrinaire and more pragmatic, and less fluid and more organised. This dual process may be described as routinisation. Through it, the successful sect comes in course of time to look more and more like the church, the disenchantment with which was the original cause of its foundation. <P>
<!-SUBHED-><b><b>Sources of Fund<P>
</b></b></font><P>
 </b></font>What kind of relationship -- of complementarity or competition, of mutual help or mutual hindrance, of convergence or divergence -- are the NGOs likely to develop with the governmental organisations that work in broadly the same fields into which they are entering? The successful NGO tends to extend its operations, and, in doing so, it has to come to terms with the very problems of funding, management and accounting that bedevil the work of the government. <P>
 The acquisition and management of large funds requires both time and effort. The move from social activist to fund raiser and fund manager has been made with ease by many, but it has also brought about some change in their orientations. In my limited experience, the prime movers of successful NGOs do not like to talk about the sources of their funding, preferring to dwell instead on the work their organisation is doing and the work that remains to be done.<P>
 Then there is the question of organisation, division of labour and remuneration. Not everyone can afford to work without pay. The successful NGO needs to have administrators, accountants, project officers and field staff. Their terms and conditions of work have to be specified in a more or less formal way. Even the most dedicated promoters of social causes have to make some concessions to the demands of bureaucratic routine.<P>
<!-SUBHED-><b><b>Health of Democracy<P>
</b></b></font><P>
 </b></font>Modern organisations have certain common characteristics, whether in the public or the private domain, in the governmental or the non-governmental sector. Here, as important as the sector in which the organisation operates is the scale of its operation. It is at this point that the NGO seem to replicate, not just the ways of functioning but also the forms of organisation of agencies of the government. This cannot be an argument against the existence or even the expansion of voluntary activity in the social field outside the government's ambit. Such activity plays a vital part not only in the regeneration of society but also in the health and well-being of democracy. The public will no doubt appreciate the good work that is being done by the NGOs. But they, in their turn, must be ready to submit themselves to the same exacting scrutiny and assessment that they expect the public to exercise over the work of the government.<P>

Return of Rabri</b></font><p>

 In the 50 years since Independence, elected state governments have been sent packing at will by those sitting imperiously in judgment in New Delhi. It was almost as if the right to dismiss was a perk that came with holding office at the Centre. Mrs Rabri Devi has made constitutional history by being the first chief minister to be reinstated after dismissal. Given this, the coming days will almost certainly be dominated by Mr and Mrs Laloo Prasad Yadav, a couple with highly developed political instincts. But even as they dazzle onlookers with their inimitable brand of special effects, other participants in this overstretched drama, in particular the BJP and its allies, will surely ponder the constitutional significance of the development. Indeed, henceforth, not just the BJP, no political party will rush to despatch an elected ministry. Even the numerous failings of the Rabri Devi government did not warrant the kind of open prejudice shown towards it by the BJP-Samata Party combine. The Samata Party advanced
