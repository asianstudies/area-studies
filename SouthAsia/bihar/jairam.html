    Why Bihar is Aflame</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>No<em> swarg</em>
    out there but certainly lots of swar and <em>swabhiman</em>. </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="1">By </font><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial" size="1"><strong>Jairam
    Ramesh</strong></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Last week, the Central Government announced a Rs 500 crore
    &quot;package&quot; for Bihar. This is not the first of such packages. Over 10 years ago,
    a Rs 200 crore package code-named Operation Siddharth was launched by the Centre in the
    very part of central Bihar that is burning these days. Earlier in 1982 Indira Gandhi had
    deputed the then member-secretary of the Planning Commission, Manmohan Singh, to make a
    comprehensive study of the Naxalite phenomenon in Bihar. Some measures were taken
    following a detailed report. Going back even further, 1973-74 was declared &quot;land
    reform year&quot;. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Scheduled Castes constitute about 15 per cent of Bihar's
    population. In the central Bihar districts of Patna, Nalanda, Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad,
    Nawadah and Bhojpur, most affected by violence unleashed by Naxalites and the caste senas,
    the proportion is higher, at around 20 per cent. Central Bihar also has a substantial
    population of aggressive land-owning upper and backward castes like the Bhumihars, Rajputs
    and Kurmis. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">But these provide only the backdrop. What is more significant
    is that farm prosperity and literacy in central Bihar are higher than in the rest of the
    state. Bihar's overall literacy rate in 1991 was 38.5 per cent, whereas Jehanabad's was
    46.4 per cent and Nalanda's 47 per cent. Thus in some ways the violence in central Bihar
    is not the offshoot of stagnation and poverty but is instead a reflection of development
    and growth, however stunted. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Jehanabad is no stranger to violence. April 19, 1986, saw
    what the American historian of Bihar Walter Hauser describes as a Jallianwalla-like
    episode. Police opened fire on 700 men, killing 21, at Arwal. The issue was a dispute over
    a parcel of public land that was being claimed by landless Dalits in the face of
    opposition from local land-owning Dalits. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">In June 1987, 18 Dalits were massacred in Nonahi-Nagawan and
    in August 1988, 11 more were killed in Damuha. Other central Bihar districts fare no
    better. Twenty two Dalits were shot down at Danwar-Bihta in Bhojpur district in November
    1989. December 1991 saw the killing of Dalit farm labourers at Barasima and Main in Gaya.
    Pipra in Patna district witnessed the killing of 14 Chamars by Kurmis in February 1980.
    This is only a selective list. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The past two decades have seen the growth of a new
    assertiveness among long-suppressed and quiescent communities in central Bihar. Democracy
    may not be alleviating poverty but is certainly imparting dignity and self-respect. The
    election of Karpoori Thakur as chief minister in 1977 was a watershed, as was that of
    Laloo Prasad Yadav in 1989. Australian political scientists Oliver Mendelsohn and Marika
    Vicziany, in their recent book The Untouchables, discuss how the Musahars, the most
    downtrodden of the Dalits, have emerged as the symbol of insurrection. Remittances from
    Punjab have also helped improve the standard of housing of Dalits, something that is an
    eyesore to the traditionalists. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Arvind N. Das, one of the very few serious writers on Bihar,
    has written that legislation arouses expectations and, it might be added, also fuels
    aspirations. When expectations are belied, struggles start. Undoubtedly, Naxalite groups
    have organised the poor in central Bihar. Ironically, these groups say they derive their
    inspiration from that great crusader for land reforms and social justice Swami Sahajanand
    Saraswati, himself an upper-caste Bhumihar. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">There have been many twists and turns in Naxalite politics.
    Right now, there are three major groups - the CPI-ML (Liberation Front), Maoist Communist
    Centre (MCC) and the People's War Group. The first believes in elections and the second
    has been used by Laloo in the past. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">K.B. Sahay was almost alone in his crusade for land reforms
    in the formative 1950s and '60s. Bihar suffered for want of a Charan Singh from an
    upwardly mobile intermediate caste who would push land reforms. Even so, Bihar was the
    first to introduce legislation to abolish zamindari. But the Patna High Court struck down
    the Act, as did the Supreme Court. It was this that led an exasperated Jawaharlal Nehru to
    push the first amendment to the Constitution. The legislation on land ceilings was
    introduced in the Assembly in 1955. A watered-down version was passed only in 1959 and got
    presidential assent in 1962. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">India's foremost authority on land reforms is P.S. Appu, a
    distinguished IAS officer of the Bihar cadre. In 1994, Appu put forward what he himself
    calls &quot;a modest programme for the '90s&quot;. First, he suggests the implementation
    of ceiling laws against the 84 landowners in the state who own more than 500 acres. The
    Bihar Government claims to have acquired 3.85 lakh acres of surplus land, while scholars
    like Indu Bharati have estimated that the land that is surplus is actually 18 lakh acres. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Second, he recommends a campaign like West Bengal's Operation
    Bargha to secure permanent rights for bataidars and tenants. Third, since there are real
    limits to land reform, he advocates that the government should acquire private land and
    turn it over to the four million-odd landless families. Sadly, the new package does not
    even recognise what Appu has been saying. The police will benefit, not the poor. </font></small></p>
