    </div><p><small><font face="Arial">Twenty years ago, villagers of Kadi in Gujarat's
    Mehsana district would have said the black buck was an endangered species. Today, they
    would not be too sure, having seen over the years that the Indian gazelle could turn out
    to be a dangerous species. Especially in large numbers When a herd of blackbucks came to
    Vishatpura over two decades ago, the villagers, mostly farmers belonging to the Patel
    community, not only welcomed them but also risked their lives on several occasions to
    protect them from ruthless poachers from the criminal Dafer tribe. They have now realised
    that kindness had played a cruel trick on them. For the black-backed creatures, which now
    number over 6,000, roam around the fields, destroying crops worth crores of rupees and in
    the process ruining the livelihood of several farmers in Vishatpura and neighbouring
    villages. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Yet in an attitude that defies logic the farmers, who belong
    to the Swaminarayan sect and profess the non-violent teachings of 19th century social
    reformer Swami Sahajhanand, continue to protect the animals from poachers. They only want
    them translocated safely. &quot;We shall tolerate the destruction of our crops but won't
    commit sin by killing the deer,&quot; says Vasudev Mori, a schoolteacher and honorary
    wildlife warden of Vishatpura. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Meanwhile, the farmlands of Vishatpura betray telltale signs
    of distress: barren fields, destroyed crops and distraught farmers. The villagers have
    spent many a sleepless night trying to stop the rampage of the blackbucks. They claim the
    annual loss due to crop damage is Rs 5 crore. To add to their woes, crop yield has also
    fallen to less than 50 per cent in the two decades. Earlier, two or three crops were
    cultivated each year, but the blackbucks have forced a change in the crop pattern.
    &quot;For whom should we grow more than one crop? For the blackbucks?&quot; asks a
    distraught Ravaji Thakore of Ghughla village. Agony is writ large on his face; the jowar
    yield from his fields is now less than a third of what it used to be before the blackbuck
    menace. He has been reduced to borrowing money at high interest rates to eke out a living.
    Laljibhai Vithalbhai Patel, another farmer, suffered a loss of Rs 15,000 recently when
    blackbucks overran the standing wheat crop on his farm. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Cash-rich crops like coriander and cumin and pulses like
    tuvar are no longer grown for they attract the deer. Many farmers have been forced instead
    to switch over to jowar, wheat and paddy. But there is little gain even in this because
    the blackbucks actually do more damage running through the fields than by foraging on the
    crops. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The state Forest Department did draw up a primary
    translocation plan to shift the blackbucks to nearby sanctuaries without hurting them in
    deference to the sentiments of the peace-loving villagers. Four of the six blackbucks
    which were shifted to Indroda Nature Park near Gandhinagar, however, died of shock.
    Nevertheless, the department is going ahead with its plans to trap the deer and shift them
    to sanctuaries all over Gujarat or to areas which are mostly non-agricultural. Says
    Govindbhai A. Patel, chief conservator of forest (wildlife): &quot;Translocation is
    turning out to be a difficult as well as a costly affair.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Mori wants environmentalists in the country to take up the
    issue. &quot;They are in the habit of giving unsolicited advice in this country,&quot; he
    says. &quot;We challenge them to suggest a remedy to our problem without causing harm to
    the deer.&quot; However, according to sources, the Forest Department might be forced to
    issue hunting licenses under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act for killing the
    blackbucks as a last resort if other alternatives fail. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">This is not pleasant news to a community whose faith preaches
    jivdaya or mercy to all living beings. But in a village like Vishatpura whose population
    has halved in two decades as the blackbucks have forced many to abandon farming and shift
    to urban areas for a livelihood, the peaceful co-existence between villagers and
    blackbucks is turning into a struggle for existence. And that's when the thin line between
    man and beast disintegrates. </font></small></td>
