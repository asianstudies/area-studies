<a name="35ma">3<b>5 MASSACRED IN BIHAR</b></a><p>

 
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES <p>

 Patna, March 18:<br>
 At least 35 people were killed and five injured seriously when
 People’s War Group (PWG) activists attacked Senari village
 in Bihar’s Jehanabad district late tonight, police said.
 Unofficial reports put the toll at 42. <p>

 Inspector-general of police Nilmani said about 100 Naxalites,
 armed with sophisticated weapons, raided the village and fired
 indiscriminately at the people after storming their houses. Most
 victims belonged to the upper caste, he said. <p>

 The massacre came a day after chief minister Rabri Devi,
 sacked after a spate of killings and later reinstated, won the
 vote of confidence. <p>

 According to preliminary information received here, the
 victims included women and children. Official sources said
 many people were killed in their sleep, while a few were
 dragged out of their houses before being gunned down. <p>

 The police said many of the victims are believed to be linked
 to the Ranbir Sena, private militia of the landlords. <p>

 The police said that after the killing, the attackers distributed
 leaflets saying the carnage was to avenge the Laxmanpur
 Bathe and Shankarbigha massacres in the district earlier. As
 many as 33 Dalits were killed in the two attacks 45 days ago. <p>

 Tonight’s is the second revenge strike by Naxalites this month.
 On Holi, when President’s rule was still in place, Naxalites
 had struck in Jehanabad, gunning down four persons. <p>

 BOOKREVIEW/TERROR FIRMA<p>

 
 BY INDRANI CHATTERJEE <p>

 
 <b>SPECTRE OF VIOLENCE: THE 1857 KANPUR
 MASACRES </b>
 By Rudrangshu Mukherjee, 
 Viking, Rs 295 <p>

 Events in Kanpur have exercised a significant influence on the
 imagination of both contemporaries and of later generations.
 Satichaura Ghat and Bibighar are associated both with the
 fury of the rebels and the fearful vengeance of the English.
 Thirty years after 1857, the antagonisms born of those weeks
 were reenacted in the assassination of an English officer
 whose father had revelled in the bloody retribution. Passions
 still ran high on August 15, 1947 when crowds of Indians
 desecrated the shrine built by the British at Bibighar, and a
 reversal of icons followed with a bronze statue of Tantia Topi
 replacing the angel of the well. <p>

 Without the violence, Kanpur would probably not have
 merited the remembrance, not having the grand Mughal
 lineage that Agra, Lucknow or Delhi possessed. It began in
 May 1770 as a joint encampment of the troops the nawab of
 Awadh and the East India Company gathered to stave off a
 threatened attack by the Marathas. By 1801, the cantonment
 was known as Cawnpore; the following year it acquired an
 English revenue collector with police and judicial
 responsibilities. <p>

 Rudrangshu Mukherjee suggests that from this moment a kind
 of bureaucratic resistance began from among the older
 revenue knowing and collecting functionaries who
 misrepresented to the British the boundaries of villages and
 parganas, the exact figures and rates of collection. The
 suffering that resulted from wrongful assessments was evident
 by the 1840s, as “outsider" Brahmin and mercantile Khattri
 groups acquired title to lands earlier held by Rajput Thakurs.
 Yet older groups were not dislodged wholesale, merely
 antagonized. <p>

 Mukherjee is clearly on one side of the great historiographical
 divide in India about the establishment and maintenance of
 English rule in India; he believes that English control of India
 was established by the sword and maintained by the
 deployment of terror. This enables him to depict the use of
 violence by rebels in 1857 as a transgression of the
 boundaries between power and powerlessness. Unlike the
 English descriptions of the rebel soldiers as fierce and
 unpremeditated in their violence, the author finds
 “discrimination" in their targets of attack. Instead of the
 “straggling disorder" that Englishmen saw in the rebel lines,
 the author represents this as “deliberate throwing away of
 regimental" uniforms. <p>

 Hence against the covert rituals of the rebels which have
 entered folklore-- like the appearance of chapattis at
 various places-- were posed the overt rituals of destruction
 conducted by the powerful: the blowing up of rebels from the
 mouths of cannons and the burning of villages. These atrocities
 of the British were all committed, says the author, before the
 rebels had carried out the massacre in Kanpur. After the
 rebels had attacked and killed numbers of British soldiers,
 officers and their families, the ferocity of the rulers acquired a
 new and terrible edge. <p>

 But how do historians conceptualize violence? Is violence only
 a matter of the physical, blood and gore, wounds and scars?
 Isn’t violence also spiritual, pervasive and subtle in that it
 leaves no outward traces of its occurrence and, indeed in
 many cases, no traces of its victims either? The erasure of the
 histories of many groups can be a form of violence, often
 perpetrated by those who control ideas, language,
 performance, the skills and instruments of transmission. <p>

 Hence, it would be in the erasure of the songs and mythic
 verse-- the “soul"-- of the rebels, that the manifestation of
 a subtler violence may lie. The English records are partial, and
 the author, while acknowledging this, has done a truly
 commendable job in unravelling texts which have hitherto been
 treated as "eyewitness" accounts, showing the wavering
 nature of the narratives, tracing the routes by which one
 narrative merges into another English language narrative in an
 intertextual weaving of the "myths" of 1857. <p>

 It is possible that there were songs, legends and poetry which
 in fact celebrated the rebels as moral victors. The author’s
 explanation of the absence of Kanpur from later oral traditions
 is that since the Indian nationalist movement was largely
 non-violent, the violence of the rebels at Kanpur in 1857 was
 an embarrassment which could not be celebrated in song or
 poem. Yet the poem about the Rani of Jhansi (with the refrain
 "khub larhi mardani woh to Jhansi wali rani thi"), which
 every schoolgoing child in north India knows, is in fact a
 nationalist creation. How is it that the violence of the rani was
 depicted as bravery, and that perpetrated by the soldiers of
 Kanpur was not? Is there something of a hidden agenda in
 celebrating the deeds of royalty and ignoring the resistance of
 lesser mortals? <p>

 Issues of politics and culture have always been critical in
 reframing the rewriting of the past, whether in the 19th century
 or in the late 20th. Perhaps this is equally true of historians
 who do not wish to differentiate between the different strata
 and ranks within the "rebels", seeing them as united in their
 actions and intentions, and also ignore the multilayered
 character of even "rulers" themselves. It may of course have
 been that violence served to erase the heterogeneity of both,
 but we still need to rethink the issue of how definitions of
 "violence", "rebellion" and of "rulership" have also been
 created, and bequeathed to historians. <p>

 Mukherjee has swept aside the question of collaboration
 entirely. Not only did specific individual rulers send troops and
 ammunition to the English, the records give us glimpses of a
 petty Indian official improving upon his chances of a
 promotion by torturing the men he had captured (page 36), a
 loyal sepoy (p. 49), a commissariat contractor (pp. 55-58), to
 whom the colonial regime appeared legitimate and orderly.
 They too constituted the "people of India", not the least of
 whom were large numbers in Bengal (as we know it today),
 who, once the sepoys in Barrackpur had been disarmed, were
 largely inactive in 1857. Perhaps the author can look beyond
 violence and examine how far it would be possible to rewrite
 the history of 1857 from the point of view of the quiescent. <p>

 
 BOOKREVIEW/SOUND OF DISTANT
 DRUMS<p>

 
 BY BHASKAR CHAKRABARTI <p>

 
 <b>CHRISTIANITY: SUBALTERN RELIGION AND
 LIBERATION THEOLOGY IN INDIA </b>
 By Sathianathan Clarke, 
 Oxford, Rs 425 <p>

 Readers of the now famous series of historical essays called
 Subaltern Studies might well wonder if the collective has
 spawned a new religion. Detractors of Ranajit Guha, the
 original mastermind of the series, equate his erudition with
 papal infallibility. They will be disappointed by the subtitle of
 Sathianathan Clarke’s book. <p>

 Clarke has done a very interesting study of the Paraiyars of
 South India as a specific community of Dalits with special
 reference to their Indo-Christian outlook. He explores their
 communal identity through a single icon: the drum. This
 artefact has been creatively constructed by the author as a text
 of resistance and emancipatory theology. Clarke’s objective
 seems to be, in part, to uncover the system that underlies the
 use of the drum. Abstraction from the surface concreteness of
 a simple musical instrument is done by relating it to a diversity
 of social processes. <p>

 The drum is projected as an agent of the divine power both to
 strive against the cooptive inclinations of dominant caste
 Hinduism and to empower the shared sentiments of the
 Paraiyar community. Symbolism is construed through the
 book as the product of a special "mode of thought"
 (marginalization and social disarticulation of the Paraiyars)
 with particular functional properties (using the drum as a
 protective coating). <p>

 This book begins with a comprehensive discussion on
 theology as deeprooted in the Indian soil. Introducing the
 reader to Indo-Christian ideas, the book gradually unfolds the
 religious life of the Paraiyars: first from a historical perspective
 and then with an integrated study of their culture. <p>

 Clarke shows the way the drum acts as a cohesive agent and
 brings together the Dalit communities of south India. On the
 question of Christian liberation theology, the emphasis is on
 the power of symbols as cultural products, and on the
 organizing principles for unstructured feelings and thoughts. In
 exploring the complex ways meanings within a social
 discourse are conveyed, the author even tries to translate the
 drum as Christ. <p>

 Whenever professional theologists have tried to systematize
 beliefs, their ideas seemed curiously distant from the everyday
 religion of people. Clarke, a priest of the Church of South
 India, has escaped this considerably in his writing. The
 distinction between folk religion and an official theological
 religion is made thin in the book. This shows that what seems
 to matter above all in religion is human action. <p>

 Religions do try to explain the inexplicable, but they more
 often render perfectly explainable things arcane. Religions
 make everyday matters and objects sacred, creating out of the
 whole cloth beings and forces that are beyond common sense
 understanding; religions invent mysteries. The book repeatedly
 takes into account these culturally constructed aspects of the
 life of the Paraiyars and relates them to a world of invented
 symbolism, shifting images and transient feelings. <p>

 The author overlooks the relation between Dalit Christianity
 and political systems. The fashionable term "subaltern" has
 made him gloss over the difference between subaltern religion
 and religion of the subalterns. Not all subalterns march in the
 name of the pope. <p>

 
BOOKREVIEW/STRIKE AT THE MOVING
 TARGET<p>
 
 BY MURARI MOHAN MUKHERJEE <p>
 
 <b>INDIA’S FINANCIAL POLICY ADAPTING TO NEW
 REALITIES </b>
 By S.S. Tarapore, 
 UBS, Rs 375 <p>

 India’s Financial Policy analyzes issues relating to the
 money market, financial sector regulation, exchange rate
 policy and the debate on capital account convertibility. It also
 focusses on monetary policy developments under R.N.
 Malhotra and C. Rangarajan. Divided into 11 parts and 50
 chapters, it comprises articles published in 1997 in Business
 Standard. <p>

 In the first part, S.S. Tarapore argues that a rising inflation rate
 imposes substantial economic costs on society while a stable
 price environment enhances the capacity of monetary policy to
 fight cyclical weaknesses: it is the best contribution monetary
 policy can make to growth. <p>

 Tarapore counters the accusation that the Reserve Bank of
 India was "monetarist". He distinguishes tight monetary policy
 from monetarism and argues that the RBI’s performance
 would never fit the label "monetarist". "There is much merit in
 a gradual but determined approach towards inflation control.
 Once a system is put in place on a trial run in 1997-98, a
 formal parliamentary mandate on inflation for, say, a three
 year period (1998-99 to 2001-02) could be obtained. The
 inflation mandate could be an average of 3-6 per cent with a
 centre point of 4.5 per cent. A medium term inflation target is
 desirable as monetary policy is effective only with a lag." <p>

 Tarapore says that in the emerging monetary scenario an
 active interest rate policy is imperative. Monetary authorities
 should not hesitate to move interest rates both ways. Since
 April 1997, the RBI has made a conscious effort to link a
 number of interest rates to the bank rate. In June 1997 it used
 the bank rate to signal a lowering of the structure of interest
 rates. <p>

 Part three examines how a stable money market can be
 developed. Part four focusses on regulation/supervision of
 weak banks. Part five deals with non-bank finance
 companies. The author says there should be a common
 regulatory framework for banks and financial institutions; it
 should be considered a fundamental prerequisite for financial
 institutions to operate as universal banks. <p>

 Part six discusses macromanagement and the monetary impact
 of fiscal operations. Part seven highlights the policy adopted
 by the government in September 1992 to permit foreign
 institutional investors to invest in India. It also covers the issue
 of non-resident deposit schemes and examines how they can
 be revamped. <p>

 In the second half of 1995-96, there was considerable
 volatility in the Indian foreign exchange market and the RBI
 had actively intervened. In part eight of the book, the author
 discusses whether such intervention was desirable. He
 analyzes the literature on the subject and says that a policy of
 greater transparency with respect to intervention and the
 forward liability would by itself enable the authorities to evolve
 a better mix of policy measures. According to him, since the
 cost of intervention becomes known, it will become easier to
 adopt a mix of policy measures for devising an optimal
 exchange rate policy. <p>

 Part nine presents a package of measures for capital account
 convertibility by April 1, 2000. Part 10 sums up the monetary
 policy of two former RBI governors, R.N. Malhotra and C.
 Rangarajan, particularly their endeavours to bring about
 financial sector reform in the Indian economy. <p>

 The book is a valuable addition to the literature on financial
 sector reform. It will be useful for policymakers, economists,
 bankers, industrialists and students of India’s financial policy.<p>
 
BOOKREVIEW/ANOTHER LOOK AT THE
PROS AND ICONS<p>
 
 BY CHIROSREE BASU <p>

<b> 
 THE FRAIL HERO AND VIRILE HISTORY:
 GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF CULTURE IN
 COLONIAL BENGAL </b>
 By Indira Chowdhury, 
 Oxford, Rs 395 <p>

 This book once again proves 19th century Bengal remains a
 potent time warp for historians, its facets opening up to new
 and radical interpretations. Indira Chowdhury’s project is not
 very ambitious though. She seeks to delve into the "self-image
 of frailty" that the Bengali babu was afflicted with as an
 adjunct to the colonial stereotypes of the "manly Englishman"
 and "effeminate Bengali". The stereotype, she argues,
 produced multiple icons that helped the Bengali bhadralok
 reclaim his history, regain his manhood, propel nationalism and
 spawn a homogenized modern Indian identity whose
 oppressive weight the nation is still having to bear. <p>

 The problem with the delineation of the 19th century icons lies
 in the fact that most have been worked on exhaustively.
 Therefore for the most part, Chowdhury ends up sounding
 familiar. In an overview, the conclusion that the shikhshita
 bhadralok was creating a discourse of history through the
 narrative of legends, myths and fables, by identifying with the
 valour and Aryanness of Marathas and Rajputs, by alienating
 the Muslims as mlechhas, would not seem too insightful. <p>

 Crucial to the politics of the culture of the period were
 women. Chowdhury explains how women became central to
 the project of the rediscovery of manhood, but does not
 satisfactorily explain why. She believes the
 "recharacterization" of women was a response to official and
 missionary allegations of the shallow ethical qualities of Hindu
 women. But the painting of the picture of sati-Sabitri had to
 do more than that. <p>

 Western education turned the babus into servile clerks, British
 legislation took away their landed status and quite alarmingly,
 crept into the privacy of their antahpur. Confused and
 defeated, the Bengali bhadralok turned for solace to the
 confines of home that now became the domain of his
 undisputed sway. Women came to bodily represent this
 autonomous zone. Hence the emphasis on their purity, their
 chastity, their satitva. <p>

 Chowdhury concentrates on the icon that came to represent
 these qualities. Sati-Sabitri represented the chaste Hindu
 woman with her unqualified ability to sacrifice and to suffer. It
 was on Sabitri that the image of the shahadharmini was
 modelled who with her right mix of education and qualities
 would keep the man where he belonged. <p>

 Chowdhury’s project of frailty is probably best explored in
 the image of the Bharat Mata. The "magnetism of this new
 goddess", she argues, lay not in her chastity and moral
 strength, but in her "empowerment" through the icon of Queen
 Victoria. The latter’s resemblance with Indian womanhood
 through her femininity, affection, compassion, her motherhood
 might explain the queen’s curious invocation in the nationalist
 enterprise, even in peasant revolts. <p>

 This in a way reflected her assimilation into a benevolent
 mother figure that could be conveniently transposed with that
 of Durga or the Bharat Mata. But to argue such transposition
 necessarily "empowered" the image of the Bharat Mata is to
 stretch the point. For it is doubtful if the frail image of the
 mata ever actually got "replaced" by the self-reliant image of
 Queen Victoria. <p>

 The exploration of the perception of an alternative manliness in
 sanyas is probably the most redeeming part of the book.
 Chowdhury’s discussion of Swami Vivekananda, who
 iconized this manhood, is brilliant. The icon of the sanyasi in
 saffron, disciplining his procreative capacity for the service of
 the nation, Vivekananda consciously created informed
 Bengal’s history long after the fires of nationalism had died
 down. <p>

 Chowdhury ends by investigating how the political crisis of
 1905 summoned the use of these multiple icons. The
 homogenization this entailed severely limited the role of
 women and alienated large sections of society. Chowdhury’s
 frail hero will be a must read for those indulging in gender
 studies of the period. For the uninitiated as well, the book
 might be an interesting read for its uncomplicated narrative. <p>
 
 BOOKWISE/<b>MERGER ON THE ORIENT
EXPRESS</b><p>
 
 BY RAVI VYAS <p>

 Two basic facts on the economics of book publishing and the
 impact of multinationals on the third world, especially
 ourselves. <p>

 First, the book publisher is an investor in books. The publisher
 pays out money to the author, artist, editor, printer and paper
 merchant, and several others for producing the books. He
 also pays money to the sales representatives and advertisers
 who help in marketing and takes in money from booksellers
 and others who buy books. The publisher hopes he will get
 more money than he spends. As in any business, the publisher
 tries to reduce costs to increase income but he knows that
 "you have to spend" money to make money. <p>

 Second, the multinational corporations (mostly media giants)
 have transformed the nature of publishing industries in the last
 decade. Till the early Eighties or so, book publishing industries
 were small, nationally based and mostly personally owned. By
 the mid-Nineties, almost all the major companies were largely
 publicly owned and international. This transformation is now
 irreversible if only for the reason that it makes financial sense. <p>

 Besides, this restructuring was engineered by two outside
 forces that have come to stay: the proliferation of information
 beyond the capacity that the printed book could handle.
 Alongside came the new technology of which the computer,
 the satellite and the visual display terminal were the three main
 pillars. <p>

 Put these two simple facts together and you will understand
 why the large electronic corporations like TIT, Xerox, CBS
 and others acquired book publishers. But in the process of
 acquisitions and mergers and the shakeout that followed, the
 nature of book publishing changed. The sheer size of the new
 houses necessitated going for the mass market (crime, sex,
 glitz, celebrity gossip) which could also spin off into films and
 television serials and which, in turn, meant cutting back on
 scholarly books. <p>

 In real terms this meant that more and more books became a
 sub-division of the entertainment industry or catered to as
 wide a cross-section of readership as possible, relegating
 scholarly books for the specialized reader as non-priority
 items. Even Oxford University Press with all its massive air of
 impersonality has become more and more commercial in its
 operations, scrapping its poetry list altogether and cutting
 back heavily on politics, philosophy and economics for the
 advanced reader. <p>

 Almost every other publisher had long since discarded any
 attempt to improve public taste by raising standards; it was
 too antiquated a notion, besides being too patronizing to be
 voiced in public. Success is what mattered and success
 equalled money. <p>

 Given the size of the new conglomerates, the surest way to
 increase income was to sell more copies of each book. More
 income would increase profit, which is based on a
 fundamental principle of book publishing: manufacturing costs
 per copy go down not just a little but quite substantially. <p>

 Lower unit costs meant that the same old high prices would
 generate much higher profits; or lower prices could be offered
 with higher volume sales. Either way, what it meant was that
 books that could not sell a sufficiently large number (usually in
 tens of thousands) would be out of the reckoning. <p>

 As the juggernaut of acquisitions, mergers and consolidations
 steamrollers along, the only recourse for serious scholars is to
 move over to small independent publishers to have their
 works published. These are niche publishers who know the
 small segment of the market in which they operate intimately:
 they know not merely the individuals and institutions who
 would buy but also have the capacity to buy. <p>

 Most of these publishers are former CEOs of the large houses
 who were either eased out when the takeover took place or
 left because the heat was too much to bear. They know the
 ins and outs of publishing, production and marketing far better
 than the management accountants who have taken over the
 world of books. <p>

 Print runs may be small but they will be sold, the right people
 will come to know that a book of their interest has been
 published, and at the end of the day royalties will be paid.
 That’s all that matters. <p>

<a name="bloo">EDITORIAL 1</a> Tg 22Mr99<p>

 <b> Bloody Harvest</b><p>

 It does not matter who comes to sit in Patna. The killings in
 Bihar’s strife-torn districts continue at their own pace. The
 combatants, ultra-left extremists and landlords’ private armies,
 especially the outlawed Ranbir Sena, have proved they cannot
 be cowed by any form of state power. Two massacres in
 Jehanabad led to the dismissal of Rabri Devi’s Rashtriya
 Janata Dal government. The massacre that followed showed
 that president’s rule had made no difference. The most recent
 killings, carried out by activists of the Maoist Communist
 Centre, are the latest step in the continuing series of mutual
 reprisals. The dramatic events in the state assembly-- the
 reinstatement of the RJD government and the split in the
 Samata Party-- have caused no interruption in this chain of
 events. What has to be acknowledged is the complete
 disjunction of the Naxalite-Ranbir Sena battle with the ups
 and downs of state politics. It is true that a combination of
 callousness and complicity on the part of the state government
 has allowed the revival of bloodthirsty violence over the last
 few years. It is also true that the ultra-left groups profess a
 certain political ideology as the basis of their programme to
 lead poor peasants against exploitative landlords. But within
 the predominantly feudal setup of agricultural Bihar, the battle
 has taken on the characteristics of a caste war. Just as the
 Ranbir Sena tends to go for poor Dalits in their killing sprees,
 the extremists gun for Bhumihars, not always rich, in theirs.
 The poor and powerless become, in both cases, victims of
 exemplary killings, fodder in a show of strength between two
 murderous forces. In this situation, there can be no question of
 development of resources, of education, of healthcare or
 anything close to normal life. <p>

 According to the RJD, the Centre has been indifferent to its
 requests for more paramilitary forces-- 78 companies in total
-- and has withdrawn 17 of the 28 companies which were
 already deployed. Although the RJD government cannot be
 lauded for its inability to curb the killings, its argument on this
 count is a valid one. The point, though, lies elsewhere.The
 beginnings of a resolution of the terrible situation in Bihar will
 be possible when at least one political party, whether the RJD
 or the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party, genuinely
 desires to put a stop to the killings. The BJP needs to be
 reminded that there is more to governance than "I told you so"
 exercises. The Congress needs to think whether it can do a
 little more than scramble for cover behind projected calls for
 Rabri Devi’s removal and threats of withdrawal of support to
 the RJD state government. The RJD, of course, has the major
 share of responsibility. And the last thing it should do is to play
 on the caste angle of the battle. <p>

<a name="lalo"> <b>LALOO PARTY, CENTRE TRADE BARBS 
 ON BIHAR</b>.</a> Tg23Mr99<p>
 

FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT <p>
 
New Delhi, March 22<br>
The war of words between the BJP and the Rashtriya Janata
Dal (RJD) over Bihar is escalating. After calling each other
names, they are now wrangling over their respective onus in
ensuring Bihar’s development. <p>

The RJD thinks it is the Centre’s fault that Bihar is in the
doldrums. The Centre feels it is a comment on the RJD
government’s inefficiency. Retaliating to the BJP’s remarks on
the Rabri Devi government, the RJD today accused the
Centre of sabotaging the interests of the Bihar government. <p>

At a press conference in Delhi, RJD MP from Darbhanga,
M.A.A. Fatmi, heaped abuse on the Centre for failures
ranging from dearth of paramilitary forces to absence of
development in Bihar. "Jab tak development nahin hoga
tab tak maar-kaat chalega (This war will continue as long as
there is no development in Bihar)" he said. <p>

Two days ago, Laloo Prasad Yadav’s party blamed the
Centre for ignoring repeated requests for additional
paramilitary forces. Attention today was focused on lack of
development. The RJD demanded quick implementation of
Indira Awas Yojana and the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana in
backward districts like Jehanabad. <p>

The BJP charged the Rabri Devi government with abetting
massacres to deflect attention from lack of development.
Party spokesperson K.L. Sharma demanded a
comprehensive security-development package for sensitive
districts like Jehanabad and Arrah. The BJP felt packages
would include security forces, telecom network, electricity and
water facilities. Neither party stressed on land reforms as a
solution. <p>

Fatmi said pending cases make re-distribution of land difficult.
Sharma bypassed the issue that the Left feels holds the key to
a peace settlement in central Bihar. <p>

In fact, Fatmi shrugged off the state government’s role in
re-distributing land and held the Centre responsible for
dereliction of duty. "The Centre should decide what to do," he
said.<p> 

The Congress, too, is caught in the crossfire between the BJP
and the RJD. The BJP has blamed the Congress for the
killings on the grounds that the party played a key role in
resurrecting the Rabri Devi government. p

The recent Senari carnage has somewhat fractured
Opposition unity and landed the Congress and the Left in a
spot. Left leaders are demanding that the Rabri Devi
government convene an all-party meeting in Bihar to initiate
land reforms. "Rabri Devi’s government cannot sidestep the
issue any more," CPI leader Atul Anjaan said. <p>

Senior Congress leaders Sharad Pawar and P.A. Sangma
have not minced words after the Senari killings. The Congress
wants Rabri Devi to step down, but the RJD is refusing to
yield. As far as Laloo Yadav is concerned, there is no room
for considering a change of leadership. <p>

FROM FAIZAN AHMAD <p>
 
Patna, March 22<br>
Like putting the cart before the horse, chief minister Rabri
Devi has readied the plough before the land. <p>

The carnage, which bloodied Senari barely days after Rabri
Devi was reinstated, has made the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)
government renew its decision to distribute 400 acres among
the landless on April 4 in Jehanabad. Rabri Devi will plough
the land herself before distributing it. <p>

But no one knows where the land is coming from. At least the
government is not saying. An official document says 1,183
acres were acquired in Jehanabad, of which 895 acres was
distributed till March 1998. <p>

With a sizeable chunk of land caught in litigation, the
government now has merely 16 acres at its disposal. <p>

“Where is the land? Which land is the chief minister talking
about?" a senior official asked. <p>

The public relations department flooded local dailies with
front-page advertisements. In the form of an appeal by the
chief minister, the advertisement says Rabri Devi will distribute
400 acres of land.<p> 

“Our government is committed to land reforms. Officials have
been asked to identify land affected by economic blockade
(by the Naxalites). <p>

“If the land is not disputed and not beyond the limit of the
ceiling, the owner will be accorded possession within two
months. If the land is in excess of the ceiling or gair mazrua
(illegally concealed), it will be distributed among the landless
within two months," the advertisement said. <p>

<a name="mili"><b>BIHAR MILITIA KEEP FINGER ON TRIGGER</b></a>   

Telegraph March 24 1999.  FROM FAIZAN AHMAD <p>

 Patna, March 23<br>
 The Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) and Ranbir Sena in
 Bihar have accused each other of killing innocent bystanders,
 but no letup in violence is expected as both have vowed to
 fight to the end. <p>

 The ultra-Left MCC, claiming responsibility for Thursday’s
 massacre of 35 Bhumihars at Senari, said in a statement the
 victims patronised the Sena and had taken part in its terror
 campaigns. <p>

 The statement, signed by MCC central zone committee
 secretary Badal, said: "We are committed to wiping out the
 landlords’ private army. The Senari exercise was executed to
 check the killing of innocent, poor people." <p>

 Denying the perception that the Senari victims were innocent,
 Badal said: "They were reactionaries and staunch supporters
 of the Ranbir Sena. They have been giving shelter to Sena
 killers and helping it financially." Badal warned upper-caste
 Bhumihars to break away from the Sena or face a fate similar
 to Senari. <p>

 He said the MCC could not remain silent on the killing of poor
 people by "upper-caste goons". "Eight hundred comrades
 executed this peoples’ action," he claimed. His statement
 contained no reference to the MCC’s attack on the Saharsha
 police picket as alleged by the authorities. Police said the
 picket was attacked to prevent deployment of forces to
 Senari. <p>

 Threatening more massacres, the statement said: "If the Ranbir
 Sena continues its anti-people operations, we will be forced to
 enact more Senaris." <p>

 However, refusing to be cowed down by the MCC threat,
 Ranbir Sena spokesman Shamsher Bahadur Singh said the
 landlords’ army was firm on "eliminating extremism. "We are
 firm on liquidating all ultra-Left extremist groups even though
 we have no animosity against the poor or Dalit farm
 labourers," he said in a statement issued from the Sena’s ‘new
 police lines’ office. <p>

 The Ranbir Sena, for the first time, attacked state BJP chief
 Sushil Kumar Modi for saying his party would extend support
 to the government to eliminate the private landlords’ army. <p>

 Singh said the Senari carnage was executed by the MCC at
 the behest of a particular political party, meaning the ruling
 Rashtriya Janata Dal. "The Sena will soon avenge the Senari
 carnage," he warned. <p>

 Jehanabad, scene of much bloodshed recently, got a new
 district magistrate. R.K. Shrivastava, IAS and managing
 director of the Bihar marketing board, was sent to replace
 Arunish Chawla, sent on deputation abroad. <p>

 <a name="zone"><b>ON THE RUN IN MASSACRE ZONE</b></a>  
Telegraph26 March 1999.  FROM FAIZAN AHMAD <p>

 Jehanabad, March 25<br>
 Dalits are fleeing their homes across Jehanabad district after
 the private landlord army, Ranbir Sena, and Naxalites
 matched genocide with genocide in spiralling violence that has
 claimed 81 lives since January. <p>

 Fear stalks the streets of the Dalit tolas — hamlets of the
 poor and backward castes usually located at the southern end
 of largish villages — from where most of the men have fled.
 Every outsider is viewed with suspicion. <p>

 In Azadbigha village, a group of eight men sitting under a
 banyan tree disperses quickly as a car moves into sight. Is it
 the Ranbir Sena? Is it the police? "We are afraid," says
 Ramayan Ram, 70, after being cajoled to speak. "We are
 panicky." <p>

 Ram and the other men of Azadbigha, a hamlet of 200 Dalit
 households, have gathered in the afternoon to exchange notes
 after having spent the night elsewhere. Their women and
 children were left behind. <p>

 The men hope and pray fervently that if the killers attack, they
 would take pity on the children and their mothers and spare
 them. There is little possibility of that, given the track record of
 the Ranbir Sena which believes in "butchering Naxalites in
 their mothers’ wombs". <p>

 The Azadbigha picture mirrors that of scores of villages in the
 district. Official sources have identified 292 villages as
 "sensitive", of which 73 are "super- sensitive". <p>

 Within shouting distance of Azadbigha is Ganiari, where the
 chasm between the Dalits and the upper-caste Bhumihars —
 the main support base of the Ranbir Sena — has widened so
 much that no work is done in the fields as the harvesting
 season peaks. The Bhumihars are landholders; the Dalits
 sharecroppers or agricultural labourers. <p>

 Out in the fields, standing crop has ripened to a golden yellow
 but no one dares to cut stalk with sickle. The sharecroppers
 and labourers will not work for the Bhumihars. They will also
 not allow Bhumihars to harvest the crop, risking their own
 livelihood. <p>

 "If we do not harvest, we will not get our share," says
 Basmatia Devi of a sharecropping family. But the men, who
 do the bulk of the work in the fields, have fled the village. <p>

 At Khatangi, a village close to Senari where the cadre of the
 Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) slit the throats of 34
 Bhumihars last week, it is the same story. Khatangi is also high
 on the list of villages that the administration suspects as
 Naxalite bases. <p>

 Police have raided Dalit-dominated Khatangi several times
 since the Senari carnage. "Naxalites take shelter in Khatangi,"
 says Nageshwar Sharma, a Bhumihar of Senari. In their
 search and arrest raids, the police have picked up Khatangi’s
 Dalits at random. <p>

 "All the men fled after what happened at Senari," says an
 elderly woman. "Those who did not were arrested." Most
 Khatangi huts are locked. "We are as good as dead,"
 lamented another woman. "With the men away there is
 nobody to feed us." <p>

 The police deny that they are persecuting Dalits. "Though it is
 true that Dalits have fled from some villages for fear of
 retaliation, the situation is not as serious as is being portrayed
 by the media," says Arvind Gupta, sub-divisional police
 officer of Karpi. <p>

 The exodus of Dalits from Jehanabad’s terror-stricken villages
 is accepted by the administration as a corollary to the violence
 that continues to rage. It matters little that lives and livelihoods
 are lost. Indeed it would seem in all structures that represent
 administration -- like police station houses -- to be such a
 routine affair that it does not merit mention in official reports,
 let alone in media briefings. In Kurtha police station at the
 epicentre of the Jehanabad violence, the police feign
 ignorance. <p>

 But in Pan Bigha, some distance away, the residents are
 packing up to leave. Despite the presence of a Bihar Military
 Police picket, more than 25 Harijan families have left. The rest
 are stuffing their meagre belongings into bundles for the road.
 Hari Ravidas places some bottles and small wicker baskets
 into a bucket while his brother Shankar Ravidas ties a blanket
 and sheet with a rope. They are leaving shortly. <p>

 "Only last night we saw men of the Ranbir Sena moving
 across the village," says Hari, a farm labourer. "May be they
 were on a reconnaissance mission. Who can tell when they
 will turn on us?" <p>

 The movement of Sena volunteers has not gone unnoticed by
 the policemen. They are afraid too. "We have been made to
 set up camp in one corner of the village. We are afraid of
 what could happen if there is an attack," says a constable.
 Asked what they would do if indeed there was an attack, he
 said "We will rush to our defences." <p>

 The policemen wanted their picket in the middle of the village.
 That would make it safer for them and, they argue, safer for
 the villagers as well. "In a far corner, they could easily attack
 and snatch our arms." <p>

 The story repeats itself in Jagdishpur and Vaidbigha; in
 Ramnagar, Sohsa, Kamata, Akpopur and Murgibigha; in
 Gokupur and Dharna. The police are wary; the Dalits afraid of
 both the Ranbir Sena and the police. <p>

 "Dalits are soft targets," says Karo Manjhi, a Dalit of Senari
 who left after the MCC attack. "Dalits are killed and arrested.
 The Sena men come and kill us and the police come and
 torture us." <p>

 At his quarters in Jehanabad town, district magistrate Arunish
 Chawla is readying to leave. He has been served marching
 orders after the Senari killings. "The chasm between the
 castes is widening. It is dangerous for society," he concludes. <p>

 Chawla was posted in Jehanabad shortly after Sundar Singh
 Bhandari took over the administration for a 25-day spell of
 President’s Rule. His stint here has been for barely a month.
 The youthful Chawla said he had initiated a process to form
 peace committees in each village. The committee would
 comprise representatives of all castes. In several villages, the
 committees have already been formed. <p>

 But this is not the first time such a step has been taken. In the
 past, the administration had raised village protection forces in
 321 villages. But they were mostly stillborn because the
 conflict within the villages did not leave them with scope to
 function. <p>

 There were also instances of the upper castes cornering
 weapon licences issued to some members of these forces as
 have there been instances of the upper castes and the Dalits
 raising rival outfits in the same village.<p>

 <a name="team"><b>TEAM FLEES FROM SENARI RAGE</b></a>  
Telegraph26 March 1999.  FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT <p>

 Patna, March 25<br>
 Art often imitates life. But in tragedy-torn Bihar, realpolitik
 imitates the comic. <p>

 Replaying to a fault a recent cartoon which showed Sonia
 Gandhi’s "fact-finders" trying to persuade each other to visit
 seething Senari first, the Congress’ Delhi duo -- Shivraj Patil
 and Meira Kumar -- took the morning flight to the Capital
 without visiting the massacre site. <p>

 "The administration strongly advised them not to visit the place
 at this time, for it is in the process of normalising the situation.
 This was the opinion expressed by some mediapersons and
 others also. So, the Congress representatives decided to
 postpone the visit," said a handout released by the team last
 evening. It was signed by Bihar Congress chief Sadanand
 Singh. <p>

 By listening to the "administration, the media and others", the
 high command has shut out the pleas of the local Congress
 unit and has lent credibility to charges that the party is literally
 on the run in Bihar. The state unit of the party had been keen
 that the team make the trip to Senari. Local leaders tried their
 best to convince Patil and Kumar of the need for the visit.
 They wanted the Central representatives to see for themselves
 how the people felt about the Congress after it bailed out the
 Rabri Devi government. <p>

 Patil, who stepped out of his hotel room only once in the two
 days he was here, was in constant touch with Sonia Gandhi
 and was updating her on the situation. Even the handout was
 sent to Delhi for her approval. <p>

 Patil discussed the situation in detail with two leaders —
 Jagdish Sharma and Ram Jatan Sinha -- who hail from the
 region. Sharma was attacked by irate villagers when he visited
 Senari last Friday. Sinha had returned without entering the
 village. Two days later, he went back only to be booed away.
 The villagers are furious with the Congress for helping reinstall
 the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) regime. Earlier, too, when
 seven Bhumihars were killed in Usri Bazar and four in
 Bhimpura, no Congress leader had dared to visit. <p>

 Even a week after the carnage, neither chief minister Rabri
 Devi nor RJD chief Laloo Yadav has dared to step into
 Senari. "We want to visit, but they (Bhumihars) don’t want us
 to go there," Laloo said. <p>

 Today, the Rabri Devi government announced plans for a Rs
 110-crore financial package for development projects in
 Jehanabad. <p>

<b>Bihar Massacre</b></a>.<p>

Bihar massacre puts Congress in a
tight spot <p>

The Times of India News Service<p>

NEW DELHI: The Jehanabad massacre has suddenly turned the
tables on the Congress, which was till the other day patting itself
on the back for blocking the imposition of President's rule on
Bihar and adding another item to the growing list of rollbacks the
BJP- led Union government has effected to date.<p>

The killings have clearly put the Congress on the backfoot, which
demanded on Friday strong measures in Bihar, while maintaining
there is no change in the party's stand - that Rabri Devi does not
have the moral right to rule. Other than that, the Congress reacted
meekly asking for strong measures in Bihar.<p>

Scenting an opportunity to get back at the Congress, the BJP
came out all guns blazing on Friday. Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee said the parties which had opposed the imposition of
President's rule in Bihar should reflect upon their action. ``The
politics of opportunism can neither keep the people secure not
meet their welfare needs,'' he added.<p>

If that's mild, BJP Kushabhau Thakre cannot be found wanting.
He said in Hyderabad: ``It is not Rabri Devi's fault.'' It was the
Congress and the Left parties, who had opposed President's rule,
were responsible for the latest outrage.''<p>

The BJP let its mind be known in the morning itself when its MPs
in the Rajya Sabha disrupted proceedings demanding a
discussion on the massacre, while the Congress opposed and
harped on the Bhagwat issue.<p>

Defence minister George Fernandes, whose Samata Party has
been demanding the dismissal of the Rabri government, also
blamed the Congress. The massacre, he said, was the inevitable
consequence of the return of the Rabri government.<p>

Caught, as it were on the wrong foot, the Congress does not
quite know how to react. Its spokesman Ajit Jogi started by
holding both the state and Central governments accountable,
saying both were duty bound to protect the lives of the people.
But when asked if the party still thought Bihar chief minister Rabri
Devi had no moral right to rule, he said: ``There is no change in
our stand.''<p>

But the BJP was not about to let the Congress off the hook. Its
vice-president, J.P. Mathur, held both Congress president Sonia
Gandhi and CPM leader Jyoti Basu responsible for the killings.
``They were responsible for bringing the discredited Rabri
government back and, therefore, must take the blame for what
has happened,'' he said.<p>

The Left parties condemned the massacre and demanded that an
all-party meeting be immediately convened by the Bihar
government to discuss measures for putting an end to the killings
in the state.<p>

CPM and CPI general secretaries, Harkishan Singh Surjeet and
A.B. Bardhan, in a joint statement, said Jehanabad district should
be sealed off for combing operations carried out for unearthing
and confiscating all arms in possession of the Ranvir Sena and
other outfits.<p>

They suggested additional paramilitary forces be deployed to
intensify the anti-militancy operations.<p>

Senior Janata Dal leader Ram Vilas Paswan demanded
imposition of President's rule in Bihar followed by fresh assembly
elections in the wake of the latest massacre in the state.<p>

``The fresh killings amply prove that jungle raj is still prevailing in
Bihar,'' Mr Paswan said. <p>

In an apparent reference to the Congress and Left parties, he
said, ``Those who opposed imposition of President's rule in the
state had no moral right to criticise the RJD government for the
fresh killings.''<p>

<b>Circle of Unreason </b><p>

 Thirty-five more perish in the circle of violence viciously feeding
 off itself in Bihar. Instead of yesterday, it could have been the day
 before or the day after, instead of chief minister Rabri Devi, it
 could have been the governor administering the state. It doesn't
 matter any more. Sadly, the predictability of the killings has itself
 numbed the senses, making them a distraction too routine to settle
 long on the conscience. Indeed, even as we skip the headline and
 turn the page, we know for sure that this carnage will be followed
 by another, just as we also know that the state government and
 the Centre will once again clash on the issue. The tragedy of
 Bihar is not merely that it has become a hunting ground for caste
 armies, but much more that the partisan interests of the political
 parties will keep it so. For the Centre, the state government is
 more the problem than the violence, so it must first be removed;
 whereas the latter is only too happy to point out that the
 massacres carried on even in its brief absence, when the governor
 was in charge. The Congress brought back Mrs Rabri Devi for
 no reason other than to avoid voting with the BJP on President's
 Rule, but having done that it must now oppose her government or
 risk antagonising its state unit. The Samata Party's interest in
 President's Rule is not so much to save Bihar as to save its own
 ranks as, in fact, has been proved by the speed with which the
 party has split. In this cynical power game, there is naturally no
 space for anything like bipartisan action or collective political will.<p>

 The last time we mentioned Bihar in these columns, we had done
 so with the warning that perhaps Bihar stands condemned to sink
 deeper and deeper into the endless nightmare that caste conflicts
 have become in the state. And yet, it is easily seen that violence
 has largely been confined to a single district, Jehanabad. The
 district has been ravaged so often in the past and the pattern of
 killings so well established that by now it should have been
 possible to anticipate where the next strike will be. Under the
 Constitution, the Centre is obliged to protect every state from
 internal disturbance, which is a step preceding the imposition of
 President's Rule. In other words, rather than first dismiss the state
 government and then rush para-military forces, the Centre could
 do so in advance in consultation with the state. The state
 government for its part can identify vulnerable villages where
 these forces can be stationed. Civil rights groups working in the
 area say that the police is often posted not where the aggrieved
 live but where the aggressors live, making it that much easier for
 the latter to plan their attacks. Though caste clashes have
 seemingly affected both the landless Dalits and the landed
 Bhumihars, the former make for easier targets in view of their
 distressed economic and social condition. Indeed, should the
 Centre and the state only do some soulsearching about why the
 Dalits are being forced to seek the protection of extremist leftist
 groups, they would realise that the Daltis need economic
 independence as much as police protection. This, however, calls
 for the Centre and the state to act in tandem, which is where the
 problem really lies.<p>

<b>Meeting to review Bihar situation </b>
<p>
 The Times of India News Service and Agencies<p>

 NEW DELHI: A high-level meeting has been convened here by
 the Union home ministry for an in- depth review of the law and
 order situation in Bihar following the recent massacre of 34
 persons in Senari village in in Jehanabad district last week. Bihar's
 chief secretary and director-general of police have been
 summoned for this meeting.<p>

 Union home minister L K Advani told reporters here on Thursday
 that the two state officials would be meeting Union home
 secretary B P Singh on Saturday and chalk out ways to deal with
 the rising crime situation.<p>

 The home minister said the Centre was in constant touch with the
 state government. Even Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president
 Laloo Prasad Yadav had spoken with him on the telephone a few
 days ago to apprise him of the situation in Bihar.<p>

 Asserting that the state had adequate paramilitary forces to deal
 with the rising incidence of violence, Mr Advani charged the
 Rabri Devi government with ``not utilising'' them properly.<p>

 Despite this, he said the Centre had decided to send 10 more
 companies of paramilitary forces to Bihar and would be willing to
 send more forces if required. The Centre, he said, was willing to
 extend all support to the Bihar government and assist it in every
 possible way. ``We have been asking them about what they
 would like us to do,'' he added.<p>

 When Mr Advani's attention was drawn to a reported statement
 by Ranvir Sena, a private army of lanndlords, that retaliatory
 action would follow, the home minister hoped the state
 government would take cognisance of such statements and ensure
 security for all, particularly the weaker sections.<p>

 Meanwhile, the Congress on Thursday charged the BJP with
 talking ``incoherently and making panicky moves'' against it on
 the Bihar issue.<p>

 On the BJP's accusation about the ``dubious silence'' on Bihar by
 by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party general secretary
 Pranab Mukherjee said there was no silence as the party's views
 on Bihar were well-articulated publicly. ``I am happy that the BJP
 is watching every move of the Congress and rightly so because
 we are the main opposition party.''<p>

 Party spokesman Ajit Jogi, however, declined to react about the
 Bihar situation by saying that the two-member committee, headed
 by former Lok Sabha Speaker Shivraj Patil, had returned to
 Delhi and the party was awaiting its report. ``Let it (committee)
 submit the report. You will come to know what transpired,'' he
 said, refusing to say if the committee had visited Senari village.<p>

 Asked about the demand for invoking the Disturbed Areas Act in
 Jehanabad to prevent any retaliation by rival groups, Mr
 Mukherjee said he was not sure if the legal requirement could be
 fulfilled for invoking the Act.<p>
