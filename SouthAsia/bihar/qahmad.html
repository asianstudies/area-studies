Dr Qeyamuddin Ahmad, former Professor 
of History, Patna University, rose to distinction on
account of his doctoral thesis on the 
<i>Wahabi Movement in India</i> (1962), first published in 1966.
Subsequently, in 1994, its revised and 
enlarged edition was published. Its Urdu translation came
out in 1976. Dr Ahmed did a good service 
to the cause of early British Indian history by bringing
out this book which is a pioneer study of 
"one of the earliest, most consistent anti-British
movement of the last century". The term "Wahhabism" 
is not the name of a new religion but refers
to the puritan Islam as taught by Abdul Wahhab 
of the Arabian peninsula (the Indian Wahhabis,
followers of Sayyad Ahmed of Rae Bareli; preferred 
to call themselves Aht-e-Hadees). An
interesting figure of the movement was Inayat 
Ali of the famous Sadiqpur family of Patna, who
had also migrated to the North-West. He 
preached "a civic and corporate spirit among the
villagers, adoption of a policy of civil disobedience 
to Government and the boycott of its
administrative organs particularly of the Courts". 
These ideas were similar to those that Mahatma
Gandhi preached a century later.<p>

     The other major work of Dr Ahmad was the C<i>orpus of Arabic and
Persian Inscriptions of Bihar </i>(1973). It contains 51 pre-Mughal, 16
Pathan and 129 Mughal, that is, a total 
of 196 Arabic and Persian inscriptions (with their plates)
of Bihar, ranging from A.D. 1242 to A.D.
1786. These enable us to determine the shifting frontiers of pre-Mughal
Bihar and supply additional information about the careers and works of
officers, saints, poets, writers and builders of Bihar. His association with
Professor S.H. Askari in editing the <i>Comprehensive History of Bihar</i>,
Volume II (Part I in 1983 and Part II in 
1987) and his summarized edition of <i>Al-Biruni's India</i> 
(National Book Trust, 1985), which has gone
into several editions with Hindi and Urdu 
translations also, further testify to his eminence as a
top-ranking historian, who had specialized in
studying sources, particularly archaeological and archival, as well as

regional and local history, mints, historical 
geography of Bihar, and last, but not the least,
administrative aspects.<p>

     Born on 9 September 1930, Dr Ahmad 
came from a family of scholars of Patna city, one
of the centres of Wahhabis. He did his 
post-graduation in 1950 from the Patna University. He
started his career as a Research Fellow 
(Bihar Educational Service, Class II) in the K.P. Jayaswal
Research Institute on 22 August 1952. Here he utilized the opportunities
of research in source-materials and made tours which enabled him to
study the inscriptions in every nook and corner of Bihar. During the
course of his research work he also got the opportunity of working under
the guidance of eminent scholars like Professor S.H. Askari. In January
1960 he joined the Patna University. Apart from his interest in the Indo
Muslim history of the nineteenth century, he also took interest in local
history as is evident from his edited work entitled <i>Patna Through the
Ages: Glimpses of History, Society and Economy</i> ( 1987). His other note
worthy contributions are his translations into Urdu of Habib and Nizami,
ed, <i>Comprehensive History of India, Vol. V: Delhi Sultanate</i> and Nurul
Hasan's <i>Some Thoughts on Agrarian Relations in Mughal India</i>. Added
to this are his numerous contributions in the form of research articles
and book reviews published in various research journals and books. He
also had a penchant for biographical writings, a notable example being
his biography of <i>Mazharul Haque</i> written in collaboration with Dr J.S.
Jha.<p>

     His active involvement with the academic 
world can be gauged from his association with a
number of academic institutions like the ICHR, 
NCERT, Bureau for Promotion of Urdu, etc., and
also from the fact that even at the time of his 
death -- on 27 August 1998 -- he was busy working
on a seminar paper. His only son, Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, 
too, teaches history at the Patna University
and he thus carries on the legacy of his illustrious father.<p>

     Qeyam Saheb (as he was populary called) 
was held in high esteem by both students and
scholars. Though not in our midst at the physical 
level, he shall always be remembered through his
significant contributions to the academic world.<p>
