     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in 1947, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi turned to his
granddaughter, Manubehn, and told her, "I am a true Mahatma."<a href="#n1.1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
This statement was remarkable from a man who considered the title <i>Mahatma--or Great Soul</i>--to be
a burden from the moment Rabindranath Tagore had bestowed it upon him shortly after his return
from South Africa in 1915. Yet when one examines the personal accounts of Gandhi and his
associates covering the last year and a half of Gandhi's life, one realizes that Gandhi had finally
accepted his title of Mahatma and all that it implied. Along with the title, he accepted the
responsibility for India's problems as his own; the myriad problems of the new nation became as
much a source of his mental anguish during this period as any personal sin might be. Indeed,
India's problems in a sense directly reflected the personal flaws of the Mahatma. Now every
mistake he made became amplified, affecting the whole nation. By accepting the title <i>Mahatma</i>,
great achievement became a possibility for Gandhi; but so did great failure.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of 
this perceived responsibility was the cause of the

 [<b>++Page 6</b>]  

severe depression which Gandhi experienced in the last year and a half of his life.  At the same
time, his added responsibility was combined with a strong and still deepening belief in his work
and in his God. Finally, Gandhi, as a Mahatma, was surrounded by an aura of death-his death.
These three conditions combined to create a paradoxical personality: a man whose faith was
strong and daily strengthening, who believed in himself and the role he had been given, yet who
could not find a light to guide him, and was convinced of his impending death. One can resolve
this paradox by realizing that by the very definition of <i>Mahatma</i>, Gandhi had to possess all three
of these qualities.
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like everything 
else in his life, Gandhi's depression in 1947-48
was public knowledge; and he discussed it freely. At a prayer meeting in July of 1947, Gandhi
mentioned that friends had complained to him about the depression apparent in his speeches. But
Gandhi felt he had no other option. "As a Satyagrahi <a href="#n1.2"><sup>2</sup></a> wedded to
the truth, he could never say what did not come from the depths of his heart."<a
href="#n1.3"><sup>3</sup></a> He felt deeply subdued and depressed and the tone of his speeches
had to reflect that quality. His secretary, Pyarelal, writes of this period, a bare six weeks before
Gandhi's death:

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found 
Gandhi to be the saddest man that one could picture
when I rejoined him in the middle of December, 1947. In the midst of the pomp and pageantry of
the capitol, surrounded by loving friends, and with his name on everybody's lips, he was spiritually
isolated from his surroundings and from almost every one of his colleagues.<a
href="#n1.4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</blockquote>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyarelal was acutely aware of Gandhi's state of mind. Indeed, of
all Gandhi's associates, Pyarelal is the most sensitive and articulate in describing these moods.
This sensitivity grew from the long

 [<b>++Page 7</b>] 

relationship between the two, something which neither Manubehn Gandhi nor Nirmal Kumar
Bose (who also served as Gandhi's secretary in these last years) could claim. At one point,
Pyarelal agonizes, "I watched day after day the wan, sad look on that pinched face, bespeaking an
inner anguish that was frightening to behold.<a href="#n1.5"><sup>5</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyarelal was not alone in his observations; others noticed
Gandhi's state of mind as well. Manubehn Gandhi, in her preface to <i>Last Glimpses of Bapu</i>,
describes her recollections as a "vivid picture of the then state of India and of the agony and
unrest in Bapu's Mind."<a href="#n1.6"><sup>6</sup></a> Nirmal Kumar Bose, Gandhi's only other
companion besides Manu in Nichol,<a href="#n1.7"><sup>7</sup></a> also provides numerous
references to Gandhi's depression. Once, Gandhi told him, "I find that I have not the patience of
the technique needed in these tragic circumstances. Suffering and evil often overwhelm me and I
stew in my own juice."<a href="#n1.8"><sup>8</sup></a> Gandhi frequently described himself as
being surrounded by darkness, as though the mental and spiritual had become tangible and
physical. He once explained to a reporter why he had stopped talking of aspiring to the age of
125: "I have lost the hope because of the terrible happenings in the world. I don't want to live in
darkness...."<a href="#n1.9"><sup>9</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi's 
depression, then, was common knowledge; he spoke of
it freely with co-workers, with reporters and at prayer meetings.  Ample evidence of it is available
covering the period from late 1946 until his death on January 30, 1948. The causes of this
depression, however, are less easily discernible. For example, Gandhi occasionally made
statements questioning his life's work and his beliefs. In 1946, he wrote to a friend who was
constantly ill that he did not "understand how one of faith can be ill," and that this made

 [<b>++Page 8</b>] 

"short work of my learning."<a href="#n1.10"><sup>10</sup></a> Gandhi was dismayed because he
always insisted that if one possessed faith, one would never be ill; his sick friend apparently
contradicted his teaching. Such statements are rare, however, in relation to the number of times he
reaffirmed his faith. It is safe to say that his life's work in the spiritual sense still provided him with
direction.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of his fife's work, the Indian National
Congress,<a href="#n1.11"><sup>11</sup></a> was a different matter. By late 1946, Gandhi made it
clear that he would prefer to see the Congress dissolve. Pyarelal notes that Gandhi "was deeply
worried over the growing corruption and the scramble for loaves and fishes in the Congress."<a
href="#n1.12"><sup>12</sup></a> Gandhi did not hesitate to advise a radical solution to this
perennial political problem: "I am convinced that no patchwork treatment can save the Congress.
It will only prolong the agony. The best thing for the Congress would be to dissolve itself before
the rot sets in further."<a href="#n1.13"><sup>13</sup></a> Gandhi must have felt at least a twinge
of disappointment when he advised this action. He had served the organization for thirty years and
knew its leaders well. The Congress had been the instrument through which he had begun to
implement his Constructive Program <a href="#n1.14"><sup>14</sup></a> and the instrument with
which he had led India to Independence. Watching what he perceived to be the growing rot and
corruption in the leaders of his country certainly provided one cause of Gandhi's depression.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi was also confronted with the failure of his Constructive

 [<b>++Page 9</b>] 

Program. Untouchability had not been eradicated. Khadi <a href="#n1.15"><sup>15</sup></a> had
become the victim of fraudulent shopkeepers who sold mill cloth as homespun. Indeed, the sale of
mill cloth in the guise of uncertified Khadi was so rampant that Gandhi was forced, in a 1946
issue of his paper <i>Harijan</i>, to admit that inasmuch as Khadi production was concerned, "I am
defeated."<a href="#n1.16"><sup>16</sup></a> The basis of the Constructive Program,
Hindu-Muslim unity, was anathema to large portions of the Indian population. Without this unity,
the rest of the Constructive Program was, quite literally, worthless. An independent,
self-employed peasant population was of no benefit if communal rioting ruined their crops, killed
their livestock and destroyed their tools. Promoting the equality of women was irrelevant when
these women could still be kidnapped and converted by communalists. Without the unity
fundamental to the Constructive Program, little else could be accomplished.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communal problem caused Gandhi some of his blackest
moments. Before beginning his Calcutta fast in September of 1947, he told India that "if he could
not even make them purge themselves of the communal violence, he would feel that life was not
worth living and he would not care to prolong it."<a href="#n1.17"><sup>17</sup></a> The
communal violence and its contradiction of Gandhi's notion of Ahimsa,<a
href="#n1.18"><sup>18</sup></a> or non-violence, were important factors in his severe depression in
these last years.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in his life, Gandhi completely despaired of ever
demonstrating the power of the true Ahimsa of the brave in India. For this reason, he placed a
much stronger emphasis on the simple cessation of violence than on non-violent resistance. As he
told a prayer meeting in Noakhali, "for the time being, he had given up

 [<b>++Page 10</b>] 

searching for a non-violent remedy applicable to the masses."<a href="#n1.19"><sup>19</sup></a>
His uncertainty about the value of Ahimsa is apparent in his letters and speeches. In Noakhali, he
wrote on November 20, 1946:

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself in the midst of exaggeration and falsity, I am unable
to discover the truth. There is terrible mutual distrust .... Truth and Ahimsa, by which I swear and
which have, to my knowledge, sustained me for sixty years, seem to fail to show the attributes I
have ascribed to them.<a href="#n1.20"><sup>20</sup></a></blockquote>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of intense self-examination, Gandhi nonetheless
invariably reaffirmed his basic beliefs. He did not reject non-violence, for example. He decided
that there had never been an example of true non-violence in India; the people had won
independence through simple passive resistance, the tool of the weak.<a
href="#n1.21"><sup>21</sup></a> In a letter to his son, Ramdas, he questions whether he had been
"nurturing only weakness in the name of non -violence?"<a href="#n1.22"><sup>22</sup></a>
Non-violence was not wrong and it had not failed; rather, the Indian people had failed to use
Ahimsa, and Gandhi had failed to properly demonstrate it. This sense of personal failure stems
from the burden of responsibility Gandhi's acceptance of his role as a Mahatma implied. This
haunting responsibility led him into disillusionment and depression.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of Gandhi's anguish was his declining power as a
leader of India. Having finally accepted the idea and the role of a true Mahatma, this lack of real
followers must have rankled. N. K. Bose argues that Gandhi came to feel he could not influence,
much less lead, India.<a href="#n1.23"><sup>23</sup></a> Another close associate of Gandhi's,
Acharya Kripalani, made the same point when asked why he did not support Gandhi's stance on
partition.

 <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because I feel that he has as yet found no way of tackling
the problem on a mass basis. When he taught us non-violent

 [<b>++Page 11</b>] 

non-cooperation, he showed us a definite method which we h
non-cooperation, he showed us a definite method which we had. at least mechanically followed.
Today he himself is groping in the dark.<a href="#n1.24"><sup>24</sup></a></blockquote>

This groping was reflected at his prayer meetings, where Gandhi frequently told people with
complaints that the Congress government would surely solve their problems. He was referring to
the same Congress Party which he wanted to see dissolved! Here one senses Gandhi's impotence
as a leader in the different environment of Independence. Having lost the people's mandate, he
could do nothing to lead them. This rejection of his leadership certainly dealt a blow to the mental
state of the man who had freed India. "Sometimes he asked himself, had India free no longer any
need of him as it had when it was in bondage?"<a href="#n1.25"><sup>25</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most significant cause of Gandhi's depression was
within himself. Here we find the most convincing evidence of Gandhi's acceptance of his role as
Mahatma. Gandhi accepted the responsibility for India's communal problem in a manner roughly
similar to Christ taking on the sins of mankind. Although this is a loose analogy, it does offer
perhaps the best explanation for Gandhi's depression during this period. Once he had accepted this
responsibility, he had to be successful in saving India. To understand Gandhi's feelings, one need
only imagine the desolation of Christ if he had failed to provide any salvation for Mankind. It was
this type of desolation which Gandhi was experiencing. In his diary he wrote that "God's grace
alone is sustaining me. I can see that there is some grave defect in me somewhere which is the
cause of all this."<a href="#n1.26"><sup>26</sup></a> Pyarelal, explaining this particular passage,
remarks that he heard Gandhi muttering, "Where could I have missed my way? There must be
something terribly lacking in my Ahimsa and faith which is responsible for this."<a
href="#n1.27"><sup>27</sup></a> At another moment, speaking of the communal violence in
Noakhali, Gandhi admits that "I am

 [<b>++Page 12</b>] 

responsible for all this. I have made a mistake somewhere in weighing the pros and cons of
non-violence .... It is well that I have awakened to my mistake at the fag end of my life and can
see it now."<a href="#n1.28"><sup>28</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. R. Nanda, in his biography of Gandhi, argues that such a
sense of responsibility was natural in light of Gandhi's long involvement and leadership in Indian
politics.<a href="#n1.29"><sup>29</sup></a> In a general way this is true, but one must remember
the nature of Gandhi's involvement in politics. He claimed the right to lead only through his
superior moral conduct; his leadership consistently followed moral principles. Gandhi had always
felt sadness at the failure of Indians in non-cooperation movements; but in these last years, he now
claimed the responsibility for their failure himself. Previously he had taken responsibility only for
inciting India to a non-violent movement to which it could not adhere. Since Gandhi's political
career was spiritual in nature, both in public and private terms, Gandhi's sense of responsibility
was also spiritual in nature. The Mahatma now accepted his responsibility for the sins of India; he
saw himself, quite literally, as her soul.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we might explain this sense of guilt, Gandhi was
certain that he was responsible because he was flawed. He was never able to discern what the flaw
was. Ironically, it was often the very depression which enveloped him which he suspected of being
the culprit. Gandhi often claimed that his lack of emotional detachment was the probable cause of
his failure. In late 1946 he wrote, "I have not yet developed detachment to a sufficient extent. The
happenings  in Noakhali succeeded in upsetting me, for there are moments when my heart gives
way to anxiety and anger."<a href="#n1.30"><sup>30</sup></a> In a diary entry he notes that
"anger-heart-searching continues. Hard to maintain detachment of mind in midst of the raging
fire."<a href="#n1.31"><sup>31</sup></a> Without the equanimity which detachment provides,
Gandhi could not

 [<b>++Page 13</b>] 

adequately cope with the problems he faced; paradoxically, he had to face those problems because
of the identification with the nation demanded by his status as Mahatma.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that Gandhi felt he was flawed is emphasized by his
declaration that he no longer aspired to live to be 125 years of age. He believed he had lost his
path and would not find it again. As he explained to a reporter,

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had the impertinence openly to declare my wish to live 125
years, I must have the humility, under changed circumstances, openly to shed that wish .... This
has not been done in a spirit of depression. The more apt term perhaps, is helplessness.<a
href="#n1.32"><sup>32</sup></a></blockquote>

Whatever Gandhi's feelings about his flawed character, it is most likely that the flaw he perceived
was the narrow gap between saintliness and godliness.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However deep Gandhi's sense of failure and depression, and
however hopeless and helpless Gandhi felt, the overwhelming conviction of his beliefs remains
impressive. Despite his anguish, he was never so desolate as to abandon his path, his beliefs, or his
God. Gandhi continued to defend his own idiosyncratic path. "I ask nobody to follow me.
Everyone should follow his or her own inner voice . . . Millions like me may fail to prove the truth
in their own lives-that would be their failure-never [the failure] of the eternal law."<a
href="#n1.33"><sup>33</sup></a> Though his own path might fail, he would not give up hope for
India. When asked by a reporter whether he had despaired of saving India, Gandhi replied, "I
cannot, so long as I have faith in that living Power which is more with us than we know."<a
href="#n1.34"><sup>34</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi was not refuting the seriousness of India's situation, nor
implying that he knew what to do. He was reiterating what he had believed all his life: he sought
the Truth, he was following the path to God, and this path was never wrong. A general in the
Indian army asked Gandhi in December of 1947 how one could solve India's

 [<b>++Page 14</b>] 

problems with non-violence. Gandhi assured him, "I am still groping in the dark for the answer. I
will find it and I will give it to you someday."<a href="#n1.35"><sup>35</sup></a> Confidence
appears elsewhere as well; in a letter he assured a friend, "I am here on a difficult mission. Though
there is darkness, I am not worried."<a href="#n1.36"><sup>36</sup></a> Writing to one of his sons
in late 1946, he is more explicit about the magnitude of the problems, but he still retained a
positive attitude. "I do not remember to have experienced such darkness in my life ever before,
and the night seems long. My only consolation is that I have not accepted defeat or given way to
despair."<a href="#n1.37"><sup>37</sup></a> In light of the tremendous communal difficulties he
was facing in Bengal and Delhi during this period, the unflagging hope which Gandhi exhibited
reflects the ideal of a Mahatma. One's belief in God must be firm to face stoically the darkness and
still remain convinced that the light will someday appear.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severity of India's problems throws Gandhi's faith into sharp
relief, yet no fundamental change occurred in his attitudes and beliefs. He still believed that "a
beginning is always made by a few, even one."<a href="#n1.38"><sup>38</sup></a> Pyarelal best
describes this saintly quality of hope.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an almost superhuman effort of the will he was able in the
midst of all this to preserve his balance and even his good humor .... He seemed to have access to
some hidden reservoir of strength, optimism, joy and peace, which was independent of other
circumstances.<a href="#n1.39"><sup>39</sup></a></blockquote>

The Gandhi which Pyarelal described was not a new man; the serenity had been with him since his
early years. It was only more apparent at this juncture, when it was maintained in the face of
tremendous difficulties.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi's work in the Noakhali District of Bengal during 1946
and 1947 provides a good example of the Mahatma's delicate balance between despair and the
faith of a saint. As he began his stay in Noakhali, he told a prayer meeting that "today I am going
through

 [<b>++Page 15</b>] 

the greatest test of my life. I am now to find if the road I follow is really the true road for the
people of this country."<a href="#n1.40"><sup>40</sup></a> The test of Noakhali brought Gandhi a
combination of comfort and despair, for even as he realized the failure of the people to practice
Ahimsa, he recognized the truth and power of non-violence.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This testing of Ahimsa was intimately bound up with Gandhi's
testing of himself. Implicit in this process was Gandhi's acceptance of his saintliness. Now he was
not simply a votary of Ahimsa, but the representative through which this Ahimsa worked and
through which it could be tested. A reporter questioned the significance of the Noakhali
experiment. Gandhi replied,

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question 
would not arise if you knew that I was going to a
village for my own sake, that is, to test my Ahimsa .... If I have the requisite courage and capacity
to undergo a comparatively hard life and to encourage inner Ahimsa, I should expect to affect
both Hindus and Muslims in the right manner.<a href="#n1.14"><sup>41</sup></a>
</blockquote>

Non-violence was so vital to Gandhi's existence that it became almost a part of him: it became his
Ahimsa. At a prayer meeting, Gandhi confessed that "his technique of non-violence was on trial. It
remained to be seen how it would answer in the face of the present crises. If it had no validity, it
were better that he himself should declare his insolvency." <a href="#n1.42"><sup>42</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi was not so bold as to declare himself the sole possessor
of the truth. He maintained his humility; without it he could not have aspired to such heights. He
told his followers, "if an imperfect man like me can try to practice Ahimsa, all of you can also do
so." To this he added a more ambitious footnote, "I have come here with the determination to put
my Ahimsa to the test and in that process either succeed or perish."<a
href="#n1.43"><sup>43</sup></a> He was careful to explain the personal implications of failure.
"Even if my mission here should fail, it will not be the failure of Ahimsa itself. It will be the failure
of my Ahimsa."<a href="#n1.44"><sup>44</sup></a> Gandhi firmly believed that he was following
God's

 [<b>++Page 16</b>] 

Divine Will, and that therefore he was the proper person to test the principle of Ahimsa. But he
admitted that a failure in Noakhali would have to mean that he was wrong; it would be Man, not
God, who erred.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi's proposal to test his Ahimsa was a confident one. From
the available evidence, it is clear that the possible failure of his Ahimsa was not one of his serious
fears.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully conscious that my views are not shared by others and I
am the only one who holds them, but these views cannot be changed now. The more I reflect
upon them the greater conviction they carry with me.<a href="#n1.45"><sup>45</sup></a>
</blockquote>

The tension between doubt and confidence arose because Gandhi had progressed so far in his
experiments with truth that it was almost inconceivable that he might fall. It seemed impossible
then, as it does today, that he might be wrong. Gandhi may have felt this as well, but his humility
forced him to contemplate the possibility of both success and failure. His conviction triumphed,
and Gandhi offered an explanation of why this was so. "Life is an aspiration. Its mission is to
strive after perfection, which is self-realization. The ideal must not be lowered because of our own
weaknesses and imperfections."<a href="#n1.46"><sup>46</sup></a> Life is an aspiration, not an
achievement. By this definition perfect success can never be attained, and is not to be expected.
The only attainable perfection is a state of constant striving; this the Mahatma could not fail to
achieve.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps his greatest strivings in his last years were the Calcutta
and Delhi fasts which began on September 1, 1947 and January 13, 1948, respectively. Gandhi set
his goal in Calcutta as follows: "I have to find peace in the midst of turmoil, light in the midst of
darkness, hope in despair."<a href="#n1.47"><sup>47</sup></a> A man could not possess a higher
aspiration. Fasting would help attain this goal. It was Gandhi's response to tension in New Delhi.
He explained his decision in the following manner:

 [<b>++Page 17</b>] 

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My impotence has been gnawing at me of late. It will go.
immediately once the fast is undertaken.... The final conclusion has flashed upon me and it makes
me happy. No man, if he is pure, has anything more precious to give than his life.<a
href="#n1.48"><sup>48</sup></a></blockquote>

During the fasts Gandhi was at his happiest. Pyarelal writes of the Delhi fast: "With the launching
of the fast Gandhi passed from tumult into peace .... Never had he appeared so cheerful and
care-free as immediately after the commencement of his fast."<a href="#n1.49"><sup>49</sup></a>
The peace came from this "striving after perfection;" Gandhi was aspiring to such great deeds that
he was willing to give up that inspiration which he had called "life." Like the ecstasies of the
saints, only through suffering could Gandhi experience true joy, for it was only through suffering
that he could serve his fellow man. The inner peace was shattered as soon as the fasts ended, as
Gandhi indicated in a letter after the Delhi fast: "From calm, I have entered storm."<a
href="#n1.50"><sup>50</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reading about Gandhi's last years, one experiences a sense of
urgency and of impending doom; one is aware that the end is approaching. Yet Gandhi also felt
this sense of urgency, and at times it seems he had premonitions of his death. Gandhi had always
believed that death was not to be feared, because ultimately all would die. He did fear, however,
the manner of his death. He once wrote to a friend in 1946,  "There is an art in dying also. As it is,
all die, but one has to learn by practice how to die a beautiful death."<a
href="#n1.51"><sup>51</sup></a> One must be ready for death, to look towards it every moment
with a sense of joy and faith in God, to prepare for dying a beautiful death. Gandhi's life of
Ahimsa had been his practice to this end. He had prepared himself from his years in South Africa
to be willing to die for his cause. He admitted to Manubehn that if he were to die a violent death
at the hands of an assassin, he would be a true Mahatma.<a href="#n1.52"><sup>52</sup></a> He
was prepared not only to die, but to die the beautiful martyrdom of a Mahatma.

 [<b>++Page 18</b>] 

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyarelal advises us that, in December of 1947, Gandhi "was
literally praying that God should gather him into his bosom and deliver him from the agony which
life had become."<a href="#n1.53"><sup>53</sup></a> Gandhi also expressed the desire to be killed
by an assassin. He told Manu, shortly before his death, that

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I die of illness, you should declare me a false or hypocritical
Mahatma. And if an explosion took place, as it did last week, or somebody shot at me and 1
received his bullet on my bare chest, without a sigh and with Rama's name on my lips, only then
you should say that I was a true Mahatma."<a href="#n1.54"><sup>54</sup></a></blockquote>

His desire for a martyr's death is significant. He had accepted his public and spiritual role as a
Mahatma, and he realized that only death at the hand of an assassin would finally complete and
confirm his life's work.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi had a strong suspicion that he would be killed, which
naturally increased after the January 20th, 1948, bomb explosion at his prayer meeting in New
Delhi. The accuracy of his premonitions is uncanny. On January 28th, two days before his death,
Gandhi told Manubeln:

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am to die by the bullet of a mad man, I must do so smiling,
God must be in my heart and on my lips. And if anything happens, you are not to shed a single
tear.<a href="#n1.55"><sup>55</sup></a></blockquote>

On the morning of the 30th, as Manu was preparing some throat lozenges for the night, Gandhi
chided her, "Who knows what is going to happen before nightfall or even whether I shall be
alive? If at night I am still alive you can easily prepare some then."<a
href="#n1.56"><sup>56</sup></a> The same morning Gandhi told a co-worker to "bring me my
important letters. I must reply to them today, for tomorrow I may never be."<a
href="#n1.57"><sup>57</sup></a> Finally, on his way out of Birla House to go to the prayer meeting,

 [<b>++Page 19</b>] 

moments before his death, Gandhi gave two co-workers a message to relay to two men who were
waiting to see him. "Tell them to come after prayer; I shall then see them-if I'm alive."<a
href="#n1.58"><sup>58</sup></a>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statements and their timing are certainly startling. One
biographer, B.R. Nanda, "wonders whether he had a presentiment of an early end, or whether
these remarks were no more than occasional glimpses of the torture of mind and spirit which he
suffered during this period."<a href="#n1.59"><sup>59</sup></a> There is no clear answer to Nanda's
question. Gandhi was aware of the hostility directed against him and could not expect to be safe
from the violence surrounding him. One might say Gandhi thought it a "good bet" that he would
be assassinated. It is unlikely that these were merely morbid outbursts of a person overwhelmed
by despair, in view of Gandhi's relatively positive attitude toward death, and his refusal to be
wholly overcome by his despair. He believed in his truth, and in his being a Mahatma. Accepting
himself as a Mahatma, the only death he--like any other saint--could reasonably expect would be
martyrdom.

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassination, then, was the death that Gandhi both expected
and desired. He was correct in believing that death at the hands of an assassin would validate his
life's work, to prove it was not the work of a "false" Mahatma. N. K. Bose ponders this idea in the
conclusion of <i>My Days with Gandhi</i>:

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that martyrdom which 
brought his life to a finale which is comparable to the Greek tragedies
acted as the touchstone which gave new meaning and new significance to the words which had so
long sounded commonplace or strange in our heedless ears .... India is blessed because she gave
birth to one who became Gandhi, and perhaps, blessed again that, by dealing him the blow of
death, we endowed his life with an added radiance which shall enrich the heritage of humankind in
all ages to come.<a href="#n1.60"><sup>60</sup></a></blockquote>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, Gandhi's violent death is the only logical
culmination of his life's work, and especially of his last years. During his last phase, Gandhi
accepted himself as a true Mahatma, and

 [<b>++Page 20</b>] 

thereby accepted the responsibility for India's fate and for her sins. An introspective, depressed
state of mind is concommitant with the carrying of such a burden. At the same time, the depth of
his conviction that his path was the right one, and that God would show him the light, was also to
be expected. Without such beliefs, the burden he carried would have crushed him. Only a man of
intense spiritual conviction could attempt to face the communal problem as Gandhi did.
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final phase of Gandhi's life marked yet another step in his
progress along the path of truth. Perhaps Tagore had envisioned Gandhi's future glory when he
called him <i>Mahatma</i>, but Gandhi had known that only a lifetime of service would carry him to this
height of achievement and make him a true Mahatma. In his last years he acknowledged that he
had achieved this height, that he was indeed a Mahatma. The realization was not sudden: it had
come slowly and steadily as Gandhi pursued his truth. With this acceptance came the burden of
India's problems, relieved only by the power of his beliefs and, finally, by his death. "Life is an
aspiration," he had said. In life he aspired to suffer for India. It was fitting that his death should
complete that suffering.

British Rule. As such it was responsible for organizing and carrying out Gandhi's non-violent

Program was designed to prepare India for Independence by teaching the people self-discipline
and self-sufficiency. The main points of this program included Hindu-Muslim unity, the boycott of
British goods, production of homespun Khadi, and the uplift of untouchables and women.

     </a><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="n1.15">[15]. Khadi is homespun cloth but
the word also came to represent the entire movement to boycott British cloth in favor of Indian
cloth. In its loosest sense, it can refer to the Constructive Program.

for harm or violence, "ahimsa," then becomes non-violence. For Gandhi the term had the
additional meaning of maintaining one's personal integrity through adherence to non-violence to
