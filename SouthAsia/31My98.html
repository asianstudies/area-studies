 <b><i>Nuclear Fear and Narcissism Shake South Asia</i></b><br>
    By <b>STEVEN R. WEISMAN</b><p>     

     India and Pakistan could not have asked for a clearer example of the futility of nuclear   
arms grandstanding than the one they have set themselves. Now that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
has answered India's test blasts with his own, India needs to face a fundamental question. Why did
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee give up the advantages of nuclear ambiguity in favor of an
action that has clearly worsened his country's security? <p>

     A decade ago, I talked at length with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi about the virtues of
keeping India's nuclear capability in the shadows even though India's military and scientific
establishment was pushing for a bolder approach. His thoughts then are relevant today. 
<p>     Gandhi was in a reflective mood after an exhausting day of campaigning during which we
briefly got lost in the jungles of South India. Over dinner that stretched past midnight at a Navy
base on the Bay of Bengal, he acknowledged India's nuclear capability but was preoccupied by the
possibility that Pakistan might declare its nuclear capability. 
<p>     "If the Pakistanis get the bomb, I really don't know what we're going to do," he said with a
sigh. He agreed that Pakistan also had an interest in maintaining an Israeli-style ambiguity about its
possession of nuclear weapons, but added that domestic politics would likely drive Pakistan to
proclaim its nuclear status. He was right about the motive but wrong about which Subcontinent
country would go first. 
<p>     Indians at first rejoiced after the country's tests this spring. Their hunger for self-respect
and the respect of others was obvious as Vajpayee declared that India had taken "its rightful place
in the international community." Now that Pakistan has answered, Indians may have second
thoughts because their security is more precarious than ever. Since neither capital could survive a
first strike, for example, might either be tempted to carry one out? An entrenched ethnic and
religious rivalry along a disputed border could provide the initial spark. Short of nuclear threats,
Pakistan has the ready ability to keep stirring trouble in India's Muslim-dominated border state of
Kashmir. 
<p>     But India surely bears most of the blame for its predicament. The world had presumed
since an Indian test in 1974 that it had the bomb, and Pakistan was warily watching it develop
short- and medium-range missiles to deliver it. But by so conspicuously showing off its nuclear
might, India not only forced Pakistan's hand. It also threw both Pakistan and China on the
defensive and, if anything, cemented an alliance between them that India had said was its main
threat. The United States, which had made progress improving relations with India after essentially
siding with Pakistan throughout the cold war, is now distrustful of India. 
<p>     Gandhi was not wrong about Pakistan's nuclear potential. Around the time of our
interview, an enterprising Pakistani journalist who was determined to force the issue managed to
get A. Q. Khan, the top Pakistani nuclear scientist, to reveal his country's ability to make bombs. It
stirred a furor in Washington and New Delhi, eventually forcing President Bush to impose
sanctions on Islamabad. Today that journalist is the information minister. 
<p>     India's nuclear provocation will lessen international sympathy on Kashmir. India's once
hopeful demand to sit on the United Nations Security Council is probably dead. As for economic
security, the debate in India's Parliament last week revealed growing anxiety over the losses in aid
and overseas investment. 
<p>     In return for little gain, India's actions have hurt its poorest citizens. The shots of nuclear
adrenaline to the Indian and Pakistani body politic will be short lived, replaced by anxiety and
deprivation. After feeling rankled by the West's attention and respect for China and tired of what it
considers to be its own second-class status in world affairs, India has gotten the attention it wanted,
but it may yet look back fondly on the days of neglect. One can only hope that for the same
political reasons that drove them to act, India and Pakistan will learn the wisdom of restraint.

BODY: <br>
     To the rest of the world, Pakistan's decision to set off nuclear tests looks like an
unfortunate but inevitable reaction to India's nuclear tests earlier this month. "We had no choice
left to us" was how Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawiz Sharif, put it yesterday. But Pakistan did
have a choice. 
     
<p>     India went ahead with its nuclear tests only after Pakistan changed the power equation on
the subcontinent by launching its intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Ghauri, on April 6. At the
time, Pakistani spokesmen said that with the development of the Ghauri -- brazenly named for the
Afghan invader who established the first Muslim kingdom in north India in 1193 -- no Indian city
was safe from a Pakistani attack. The creator of Pakistan's nuclear bomb, A. Q. Khan, proclaimed
that Pakistan now had the ability to hit 26 Indian cities. 

<p>     Then, a few days later, Pakistan announced that it would soon test a longer-range missile,
named the Ghaznavi for the first Afghan to invade western India in search of plunder at the end of
the 10th century. The aggressive intent behind the naming of the missiles, and the harping on the
ability to hit Indian cities, sent shivers of apprehension through India. 

<p>     For its part, India had stopped the development of its intermediate-range Agni missile
("agni" is Hindi for "fire") soon after a specific request by President Clinton to Narasimha Rao, the
Prime Minister in 1994. Before this month, India had not tested a nuclear device for 24 years.
There were only two or three scientists left in the Department of Atomic Energy who had been
involved in the original project. No one had any idea whether the engineering problems involved in
the conversion of a crude nuclear device into a bomb or warhead had been resolved. India's
nuclear ability, in short, existed mainly on paper. 

<p>     India might have decided to live with this degree of insecurity if Pakistan's weapons
program had been frozen at last year's level. But that was not likely to happen for two reasons. The
first was evidence of continuing Chinese help to Pakistan in developing both its nuclear weapons
and missiles. The second was the strange blindness of the United States to the threat this posed to
India. 

<p>     Indian policy makers were always skeptical of Chinese assertions that they were not selling
equipment or technology to Pakistan for its nuclear and missile programs, and preferred instead to
believe the host of American intelligence reports that confirmed this cooperation. 

<p>     What forced India to reassess China's intentions is that this cooperation seemed to increase
after India and China signed an agreement resolving their border dispute in 1993. There was the
sale of ring magnets for Pakistan's gas centrifuges in 1994, the sale of M-11 missiles in 1995, and
the presence of Chinese scientists at the Pakistani nuclear research site in Kahuta. 

<p>     Moreover, the Indians believed that the intermediate-range Ghauri was not a product of
North Korean technology, as widely reported, but of Chinese technology. Not only has North
Korea flatly denied any such sales to Pakistan, but the modified Scud it developed in 1991 had a
range much shorter than that of the Ghauri. Since the North Koreans test-fire all their missiles into
the Sea of Japan, these tests cannot be kept secret. 

<p>     Indians therefore found it incredible that North Korea should have developed such reliable
technology for a missile with three times the range without needing to test it, and that Pakistan
should have bought a completely untested missile or its components. Lastly, Indian intelligence
believed that Chinese scientists were helping Pakistan to make its nuclear weapons small enough to
mount on a warhead. 

<p>     This cooperation united Pakistan's urge to harm India with China's ability to do so. But
what tipped India over the brink was the blind eye the United States turned to the danger that
Pakistan posed to India. Intent on constructive engagement with China and Pakistan, the
Americans have simply disregarded India's fears. Pakistan cleverly timed the launch of the Ghauri
missile for the eve of the visit of Bill Richardson, the American representative to the United
Nations, to neighboring Afghanistan. He needed Pakistan's mediation to restore peace to that
country and open the way for investment in Central Asia. 

<p>     The United States responded by expressing the mildest of regrets. India then realized that,
for the foreseeable future, it was truly alone.

<blockquote><b>
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/dave.html">Dave Matthews Band</a> 
has shrewdly parlayed the 
word-of-mouth of devoted fans into platium sales.</b></blockquote>


<p>     Each member of the Dave Matthews Band tends to recall a moment in the early 1990's
when he realized that the group's offbeat blend of jazz-style improvisations over high-revving
world-beat rhythms had a good chance of making it big. <p>

<table>
<tr><td>
     At the time, the band was a long way from stardom -- lacking even a home-recorded CD,
driving an overstuffed red van and trailer to 200 shows a year at fraternity parties, beer bars and
beach clubs around its home base in 
<a href="http://www.hyperville.com/main.html">Charlottesville, Va.</a>, 
down through Georgia, and,
occasionally, up to Manhattan. 

<p>     For <a href="http://www.dmband.com/dave.html">Dave</a> 
Matthews, the puckish 31-year-old vocalist and leader of the quintet, the pivotal
moment came in December 1993, after the group had driven snow-blind over a mountain road in
the Berkshires, arriving two hours late for a show at Williams College. 

<p>     "As we played, we realized that all the kids in this college were singing the words to our
songs," he said. "I asked, 'How in the world do you know the words?' They said, 'We've got
tapes.'" 

<p>     The band, in the style of the Grateful Dead, had always encouraged fans to tape its shows,
and now those tapes were being circulated from campus to campus, town to town. The musicians
kept driving farther afield to shows, from Alabama to Colorado, and kept meeting fans that they
didn't know they had, said 
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/boyd.html">Boyd</a> 
Tinsley, 34, the group's violinist. "The whole band just realized
that this thing was a little bigger than all of us," he said.

improvisations with world-music <br>

<p>     Since then, that thing has become just a little bit bigger.  
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/">Dave Matthews Band</a>  
is a rarity in an industry that is more interested in generating hits than
nurturing the careers of young bands. (They range in age from 23 to 40.) Largely 
without radio hits, MTV glitz and much acclaim from critics, the group has 
shrewdly attained rock-star status from the ground up.  It built an enormous 
following not through image-building publicists but by grinding out
one hyperkinetic concert after another. 

<p>     "They would play anywhere, for nothing," said 
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/BTCSpage/tim.html">Tim Reynolds</a>, 
a guitarist who sometimes
plays with the band. "They'd look like the living dead when they finished a tour." 

<p>     Behind the band's folky informality is its aggressive business strategist, Coran Capshaw,
who helped it forge an identity and maintain control of everything from T-shirt sales to publishing
rights to its songs. 

<p>     For three years, the band relied on fans' word-of-mouth and trading of tapes 
along with one independent CD to spread its loose-limbed, funky sound.  Then 
in late 1993, it signed with RCA, which at the time was not known for its rock 
roster. The band has since released three million-selling albums. Earlier this 
month its latest release, 
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/BTCSpage/index.html">Before These Crowded Streets</a>," 
sold 422,000 copies 
its first week, knocking the "Titanic" soundtrack album from the No.1 spot it 
had occupied on Billboard's album chart for 16 weeks. 

<p>     In the process the band has gone from playing bars and college auditoriums to arenas like
the 53,700-seat Giants Stadium, in East Rutherford, N.J., where it will headline a show next
Sunday. The concert sold out in 90 minutes. 

<p>     For the most part, Matthews and his band mates credit Capshaw, who owned the clubs in
Richmond and Charlottesville where the band got its start, with pushing them to build an audience
first before seeking a record deal. 

<p>     "Coran was a genius for helping develop them while keeping them out of the major media,
making sure they didn't end up overexposed," said Christopher Zahn, the booking manager for
Wetlands, a New York Club. "That way, they're selling a lot of records and people love them, but
not like Hanson or the Spice Girls. They'll be around for a long time to come." 

<p>     Mr. Capshaw also kept the band focused on the importance of making money. The 
result is Dave Matthews Band Inc., Bama Rags (its label and merchandising arm) and
about 18 other incorporated entities are all controlled by the band. 

<p>     Now the group has two dozen employees on the road during tours, and 20 more back
home in Charlottesville at a 10-acre spread outside town, working the phones and 
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/">Web site</a>, where
several million dollars a year roll in from the sale of hats, stickers, CD's and other gear. 

<p>     Occasionally the band's business savvy has trod on its 
low-key image.  Last year, for example, it sent a lawyer from record 
shop to record shop with a Federal marshal, threatening court action 
if bootleg recordings of its concerts were not withdrawn from the
shelves.  It was apparently one thing for fans to trade tapes, but 
another for anyone to sell them. This year, the band cracked down 
on Web sites that leaked recordings of songs from the new
album. Matthews said he left the legal maneuvers and deals to 
others. "I'm not a hard-driving businessman," he said, smiling. 
"Instead, I've surrounded myself with hard-driving businessmen.
They're always saying, 'Dave, we need to talk. This is business.  
You've got to stay on top.'" 

<p>     He insisted that his focus was all on the music. His distinctive 
sound reflects an upbringing during which he bounced between 
South Africa and the United States.  He was born in 1967 near 
Johannesburg, where his father, a physicist, was developing 
superconducting circuits. The family moved to Yorktown Heights, 
N.Y., two years later, then returned to South Africa in 1977, after 
Matthews's father died of cancer. 

<p>     To avoid compulsory service in the South African Army, 
Matthews returned to New York
in 1986, taking a clerical job at I.B.M. That year, 
though, he joined his mother in Charlottesville,
where she had settled. 

<p>     Mr. Matthews said he listened to all kinds of music, 
everything from the Clancey Brothers to
African folk songs to Motorhead. "I went through my 
15-year-old heavy metal phase," he said,
"when I needed to scream really hard." 

<p>     He played guitar from the age of 9 but mainly in his bedroom or with 
a few friends from high school. Only in Charlottesville did he begin to 
perform publicly.  Occasionally, friends like Reynolds, the guitarist, 
pulled Matthews on stage to play and sing a Bob Marley tune or two. 
Another friend, Ross Hoffman, encouraged him to record four of his 
own songs. The band came together in 1991 essentially as a result 
of those basement taping sessions.  At the time Charlottesville, a 
college town of about 50,000 people, had a  
<a href="http://www.hyperville.com/xbands.html">thriving music scene</a> 
that was both multiracial and diverse. Matthews, then a bartender at 
Millers, a hangout that was popular among musicians, invited some 
of the town's best players to record with him. 

<p>     <a href="http://www.dmband.com/carter.html">Carter Beauford</a>, 
a drummer, and 
<a href="http://www.dmband.com/leroi.html">Leroi Moore</a>, 
a saxophonist 
and flute player, had grown up in the same neighborhood and 
shared strong jazz roots.  Tinsley, the violinist, had played in 
a variety of rock and folk bands after abandoning years of 
classical study. Stefan Lessard was a 16-year-old high 
school student who displayed unusual talent on bass fiddle. 
He took up the electric bass guitar just months before the 
band formed. 

<p>     Mr. Reynolds, who has played on every Dave Matthews 
Band record, said that Matthews had a clear musical vision 
long before the band was born. "His songs were always the 
way they are," Reynolds said. "His music thing was kind of 
fully developed in his head, and then it all came together 
when he got together with these monster musicians."  In April 
1991 -- with Lessard leaving rehearsals early to sleep before 
returning to  high school in the morning -- the newly minted 
Dave Matthews Band began performing at local restaurants, 
then pubs, then larger halls. Capshaw, a longtime devotee 
of the Grateful Dead, sent the band out on the road, urging 
its members to focus on playing, not recording. The recording 
was left up to the audience. 

<p>     In 1993, Peter Robinson, then a talent scout for RCA, recalled 
hearing the band during a series of visits to Wetlands. He was 
struck by the appeal of this unconventional ensemble.  At its 
core, Matthews resembled a  charismatic dervish who charmed 
listeners not only with his songs but also with rapid-fire 
banter not unlike a Robin Williams quip that fans have 
taken to calling Davespeak. "Did you know that Preparation H 
is the No.1 shoplifted item in the U.S.?" he asked an audience 
several years ago. (On Web sites devoted to the band, 
samples of Davespeak are traded along with tapes of the music.) 

<p>     "The first time I saw them, there were maybe 30 or 
40 people in the audience," Robinson said. "Two weeks 
later there were 150." On the next swing through Manhattan, 
500 people turned up to see Matthews sing.  "It was 
amazing to see this audience grow so fast and these 
kids so into it," Robinson.  "It gave you goose bumps." 

<p>     He began taking higher-echelon executives to shows 
and flying to Virginia to see the band at the Flood Zone and 
<a href="http://www.redlt.com/trax/index.html">Trax</a>, 
its two main haunts. After an eight-month courtship -- 
"They filled our stomachs  with great frequency," Matthews 
said -- RCA signed the band. A few other labels had 
approached them, Matthews said, but most of the 
executives wore sunglasses even on cloudy days. 
"I could never see their eyes," he said.  

<p>     The RCA deal gave the band complete control 
over the music and allowed it to release its first CD, 
"Remember Two Things," on its own label. The group 
also retained the right to release a series of  live  
recordings on Bama Rags, distributed by RCA, a 
more profitable arrangement for the group than if 
RCA produced the records. 

<p>     Now, things have come full circle for the band.  
It hopes to find bootleg tapes of shows that have  
achieved legendary status among fans so that those 
performances can be included on future concert CD's. 

<p>     "There's a night I'm sort of after," Capshaw 
said. "It was at the Great American Music Hall in 
San Francisco in 1995.   It all clicked that night.  
When they are on, powerful things happen."

<p>     THE PROUDEST DAY
<br>     India's Long Road to Independence
<br>     By Anthony Read and David Fisher
<br>     Norton. 565 pp. $35

<p>     THE IDEA OF INDIA
<br>     By Sunil Khilnani
<br>     Farrar Straus Giroux. 263 pp. $24

<p>     Reviewed by Jeffery Paine, a Washington writer whose book "Father India" will be
published this fall.

<p>     What is the proudest day in a nation's history? One hundred and fifty years ago, the Whig
politician Lord Macaulay prophesied that when India mastered the English arts of self-governance
and became independent, it would mark "the proudest day in British history." Recently, Hindu
militants have acted as though atomic testing, and the prospect of emerging as the latest nuclear
power, has inaugurated India's great day in history. Two new books elucidate how India reached
that first proud day and from there ricocheted to that second brazen one, as the world looked on in
dismay.

<p>     Into the first of these two fascinating volumes the English popular historians Anthony Read
and David Fisher have condensed all that hubris, greed, idealism and resistance that heralded
Britain's long entrance into and long exit from India.

<p>     England supposedly acquired India during a fit of absentmindedness. Initially the British
desired, Read and Fisher argue, merely to ply an enormously lucrative "quiet trade," without
getting embroiled in noisy, unprofitable politics. But the decline of the Mughal empire had left
18th-century India a land mine of dynastic wars and civil violence, which did not permit good
shopkeeping; besides, the French were busy trying to make India the jewel of their crown. Still,
having once snatched the subcontinent away from France, most English -- by, say, 1900 -- would
have found it hard to imagine their glorious empire without India: It would be like watching the sun
set on a negligible island-power in the English Channel.

<p>     Read and Fisher fail to adequately account for this reversal in English attitudes. They are
so busy orchestrating their huge changing cast of characters, from Robert Clive and Warren
Hastings to Mountbatten and Nehru, that they ignore the changed ideas those characters worked
with. They ignore, for example, Charles Darwin, who never voyaged to India yet whose ideas
about race are pivotal to their story. Macaulay thought of India as a backward society that time and
education would remedy; after Darwin, though, Englishmen considered Indians an inferior race,
who for guidance would ever require the racially superior British version of man.

<p>     The flaw in this otherwise engrossing narrative is that it lacks any ideas to animate it. For a
prologue, Read and Fisher simply dramatize the Amritsar massacre of 1919, where the deranged
British brigadier Reginald Dyer had his troops open fire on an unarmed Hindu crowd, killing 379
people and wounding some 1,200 others. "From that moment," the prologue concludes, "for
Indian nationalists, the only question was how soon could they get rid of their British rulers."

<p>     But that was not the only or even the crucial question for Gandhi, for whom independence
was quite secondary to what manner of civilization India was to be. "Gandhi was convinced," the
political theorist Bhikku Parekh observed, "that the 'rule' of British Civilization could continue even
if the British government were to stop ruling over India." To prevent that from happening, Gandhi
took "the long road to Independence" through more bizarre turns and visionary detours than Read
and Fisher's half-a-thousand pages of straightforward political history can convey. (A half-century
would be required for India to so forget Gandhi's unique vision that the country -- in a
faux-proudest day -- could detonate nuclear devices in the far desert.)

<p>     While Read and Fisher are content to describe Indians making history, Sunil Khilnani asks,
"What is the significance of the history they are making?" Khilnani, a political scientist at the
University of London, writes with a most unpolitical-science-like elegance, and The Idea of India
even has a real flesh-and-blood hero tucked in its learned argument. Jawaharlal Nehru may appear
a curious protagonist since, of the four pillars on which he erected the new Indian state, one,
nonalignment, was irrelevant; a second, secularism, is now in retreat; and a third, socialism, proved
an economic fiasco. But it is the fourth pillar, his championship of democracy, that makes Nehru a
hero for Khilnani and makes Khilnani a Nehruist.

<p>     When India became independent in 1947, even a bookie wouldn't have given odds that it
would long survive as a democracy. India was almost the dirt-poorest country in the world, its
population largely illiterate, its sub-nationalities mutually antagonistic, with an entrenched caste
system that made a mockery of democratic ideals. Twice before, in the American and French
revolutions, movements had begun to infuse the modern world with the ancient idea of democracy.
Khilnani calls this third movement, the Indian experiment, perhaps "the most significant of them
all, partly because of its sheer human scale, and partly because of its location, a substantial
bridgehead of effervescent liberty on the Asian continent."

<p>     When Nehru surveyed the present scene in Europe and America -- democratic,
industrialized, secularized, progressive, stable -- he imagined he was seeing India's future. Today,
however, with its overpopulation, economic problems, ethnic and religious chauvinism and nuclear
perils, India may well be rehearsing the future in store for Western nations. If so, then Khilnani's
specialist tract has wide ramifications as it describes how amid adverse conditions India, of all the
ex-colonial states, forged the least likely and (so far) most enduring democracy.

<p>     Having read Khilnani, a reader can return to The Proudest Day with renewed appreciation
and understanding that the visionary Gandhi, the wily Jinnah, and the debonair Nehru were more
than simply odd allies marching (usually out of step) down the "long road to independence."
Equally important, they were introducing a vital new sense of politics and of political participation
on the subcontinent, which converted the many ethnicities and interests into a single nation after
all.

<p>     When asked whether India was one or many, the poet-critic A. K. Ramanujan quoted the
Irishman about his trousers: "singular at the top and plural at the bottom." Khilnani describes the
bottom, and Read and Fisher the top, and together these two books well describe the "trousers"
India donned as it entered the uncertain stage of its present history.

<b><i>The Man They Called Mahatma</i></b>

<p>     GANDHI: A Life
<br>     By Yogesh Chadha
<br>     Wiley. 546 pp. $30

<p>     Reviewed by Colman McCarthy, director of the Center for Teaching Peace and a 1998
Alicia Patterson fellow.

<p>     Gandhian scholars and others in the know have told me that regardless of the number of
biographies I may have read on the Mahatma, the breadth and luminousness of his life
(1869-1948) assure that new information will keep turning up.

<p>     So it is in Gandhi: A Life. Yogesh Chadha, a New Delhi writer, uncovers what Louis
Fischer and Judith M. Brown -- to take two of the major Western biographers -- missed in their
seemingly thorough works: that in the spring of 1895, Gandhi, then practicing law in South Africa,
made a day trip to a Trappist monastery near Durban.

<p>     Gandhi saw a brand of Christianity at the Mariann Hill community of 160 priests and
brothers, and a separate enclosure of 60 nuns, that is rarely seen in Western religion. "They rose at
two o'clock in the morning, devoting four hours to prayer and contemplation," Chadha writes.
"They breakfasted at six on bread and coffee, and the midday meal consisted of soup, bread and
fruits. Supper was at six in the evening, and by eight o'clock they were in bed. None of the
brothers ate fish, fowl or meat, nor did they partake of eggs . . . No one drank alcohol, no one kept
money for private use, no one left the confines of the community except on approved business,
and there were no newspapers available. And yet everyone appeared happy, and visitors were
received with humble bows."

<p>     The Trappists' personal self-discipline and collective simple living -- both linked to daily
prayer and manual labor -- awed Gandhi. Of his day among these Christians, he wrote in the
Vegetarian, a British magazine: "You see religion everywhere. I know from personal experience
that a visit to the [Trappist] farm is worth a voyage from London to Natal."

<p>     Chadha has other offerings not found in conventional biographies. Where Judith Brown --
whose 1989 Gandhi: Prisoner of Hope is both literate and analytical -- describes Gandhi's
relationship in the early 1930s with Lord Irwin, Britain's viceroy in India, Chadha does that and
includes the full text of a long letter from the Indian to the Englishman. It endures as one of the
20th century's purest statements of protest against abusive authority. "Nothing but organized
nonviolence can check the organized violence of the British government," Gandhi wrote to the
lord whose regime was lording it over destitute India.

<p>     Ten days later Gandhi and 78 followers of strong will and stronger legs left their ashram
near the city of Ahmedabad in a protest walk of 240 miles and 24 days to the sea at Dandi. This
was the Salt March, taken to publicize the British government's ruthless tax and monopoly on salt.
The march became a movement, with several thousand joining in from the stopover villages along
the way. A nationwide defiance of the salt tax followed.

<p>     Gandhi was 61. He was known through his writing -- 500 words a day during his
adulthood -- and his political successes in South Africa, where he changed discrimination laws,
and in India, where he opposed the salt tax. His political goal was Britain's expulsion from India.

<p>     Seventeen years would pass before the British were forced to vacate India. Historians
disagree on the breadth of Gandhi's role in Indian independence. Chadha argues that Gandhi
"cannot be acclaimed as the author of India's freedom." He came aboard a reform movement that
dated back to his days in South Africa. Nor did he ever posture as the leader of independence.
What is well beyond historical dispute is that, as Chadha writes, "the extraordinary manner in
which [India's freedom] was achieved can be pointedly ascribed to him."

<p>     The manner was nonviolence. Gandhi disliked the word, arguing that it was a negative,
with nonviolence saying only what it wasn't. He invented his own word, satyagraha, the force of
truth and love. It was twinned with ahimsa, the Jain commandment to live harmlessly. After a few
jailings -- Gandhi spent 2,089 days in Indian prisons and 249 in South Africa's -- he began
avoiding the phrase "passive resistance," with its errant suggestion that pacifism equals passivity. It
is, instead, violence-free direct action organized to convert abusive power. For satyagraha "to be a
creed," Gandhi believed, it "has to be all pervasive. I cannot be nonviolent about one activity of
mine and violent about others. That would be a policy, not a life force." 

<p>     As with most Gandhi biographers, Chadha records that the Mahatma walked the earth with
feet emphatically made of clay. He was an overly harsh disciplinarian with his four sons,
temporarily disowning one for wanting to marry at age 18. (Gandhi himself had married at 13.) He
quarreled with his brother Laxmidas over money. He refused to let his wife wear a necklace she
received as a gift. At 37, he embraced celibacy and denied sexual relations with his wife for the
rest of her life. When she became ill while jailed for civil disobedience (not against her husband,
unfortunately), Gandhi wrote to say he was too busy saving the world to come to her. For all of
these offenses, Gandhi would sink into deep remorse. He had the saving grace of self-awareness,
the gift of seeing his own flaws and the energy to overcome them, however fallibly.

<p>     Attention will be turning soon to naming the "person of the century." Who else but
Gandhi? In one of history's bloodiest centuries, only the advocates of nonviolence ought to be
considered. Among them -- Jane Addams, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, Adolpho Perez
Esquivel, Oscar Romero, Scott Nearing, Erwin Knoll -- none is the match of Gandhi. He wrote of
it, taught it, lived it and was persecuted for it.

<p>     By all of that, he also gave work to biographers, starting with France's Romain Rolland in
1923 and extending to Yogesh Chadha today. Until another Gandhi scholar comes along who digs
deeper and can write more movingly, Gandhi scholarship will be well served by Chadha's effort.n

<p>     THE SNAKE CHARMER
<br>     By Sanjay Nigam
<br>     Morrow. 223 pp. $22

<p>     Reviewed by Guy Amirthanayagam, a poet, critic and former diplomat.

<p>     Of the new stars that have been spotted in the literary firmament of Indian writers in
English, the two most visible are Arundhati Roy and Vikram Chandra. Roy has already won the
Booker Prize with her first novel, The God of Small Things. Chandra's debut novel, Red Earth
and Pouring Rain, won distinguished awards and has now been succeeded by his second, Love
and Longing in Bombay, which will no doubt receive critical accolades in days to come.

<p>     Sanjay Nigam's The Snake Charmer bids fair to join this select company. Of course, there
are differences between individual kinds of creative talent. Nigam does not have Roy's linguistic
fecundity, comparable only to G.V. Desani's or Salman Rushdie's. Nor does Nigam have the skills
of Chandra, who is almost a conjurer in manipulating situation and plot while capturing in
incandescent prose the ongoing life of a vibrant but ugly modern megalopolis.

<p>     Nigam's style is sparer but not for that reason less intense or less effective. The story partly
is an allegory, but it is not fantastic. Because he is not given to verbal pyrotechnics or to
adventitious tricks of style, he does not build barriers between himself and his reading public.

<p>     His novel centers on Sonalal, a successful snake charmer who wants to be the best in the
world. It is about the relationship between him and his snake, Raju, whom he loves more than a
father loves his son. But he is martinet enough to drive the snake to the extremes of exhaustion. He
wants the gods to appreciate Raju's dance and to enjoy the music he plays on his been, a musical
instrument made of a dried disemboweled pumpkin.

<p>     One of the themes of the book is the quest for perfection. Sonalal, a protagonist so faceless
that even his wife has difficulty identifying him in a crowd ("which now and then proved quite
convenient"), has a special need for eclat, for exceptional excellence in his vocation. The
man-snake relationship is firmly set against a background of family and friends, some genuine,
some charlatan: Sonalal's wife, Sarita, caring but vengeful in her own way; his children to whom
he wants to teach his snake charmer's skills but who are more influenced by their mother, spurning
his pedagogical endeavors.

<p>     One of the more moving subplots is Sonalal's love for the prostitute Reena, his devoted
mistress, who tries hard to cure him of impotence, a common malady of aging men but rarely
treated in fiction. She succeeds, she is his lifeline; humane, devoted and patient, she gives him back
his manhood. Apart from Reena, he has a good friend in an older snake charmer, Jagat, who
stresses the centrality of everyday life to creative achievement, and the importance of what we see
as mere distractions:

<p>     "The distractions you speak of," he says, "are life itself. The reason you are the best
charmer I've ever heard is because your music makes me feel that living and everything that goes
with it, the things you call distractions -- wives and children, coughs and colds, liquor and beedies,
lotteries, hot boring days, charming itself -- are important in some way. Sona, you need those
distractions. You must put every one into your music."

<p>     But the main preoccupation -- what gives the story its momentum -- is the protagonist's
sense of guilt. Early in the story, exasperated by Raju's refusal to cooperate and provoked because
the animal bites him, Sonalal does the unthinkable: He bites his beloved snake in half. From then
on, his forehead bears the mark of Cain. Sonalal's life becomes a stony pathway toward the
expiation of his guilt.

<p>     Midway through the novel, Sonalal consults a blind magician, Ratan the Great, reputed to
have performed the Indian rope trick. It is Ratan who tells him of the most potent symbols in the
story: the cosmic ether that must be sniffed and the ripe mango that must be eaten to know
perfection. Both are evoked at the book's end: "The sky seemed part of a perfection that could
never be known by a man. And yet, he, Sonalal, had once known it. On a day that suddenly felt
like yesterday he had caught a faint whiff of the ether that flows through the universe. Still staring
at the sky, he thought the ether must be blue, and way high up there, it smelled like a freshly cut
mango."

<p>     In Sonalal, Nigam has been able to create a convincing character who, though lowly and of
low caste, is able to aspire toward perfection and at least once in his life senses it. It is this
achievement that makes The Snake Charmer an exceptional novel.
