<b>Tibetan materials</b>, Assistant 
Librarian Nawang Thokmey tells me we have received 
51 Tibetan texts in the last 6 months from Delhi, two 
of which are important multi-volume collected works 
(gsung �bum). One of these is the 25 volumes of the 
collected works of the Fifth Dalai Lama <b><i>Ngag dbang 
blo bzang rgya mtsho</i></b> (1617-1682), call number I-TIB 
95910250.  The other is the 16 volumes of <b><i>the collected 
works of Smin gliin Gter chen Rig dzin gyur med rdo rje</i></b>, 
call number I-TIB 98909668.  Nawang remarks that the 
Nyginma tradition has six main lineages or monasteries of 
learning and practicing.  Mindroling is one of these monastaries 
which was established in central Tibet in 1676 by the great 
Dharma King Minling terchen Rigzin Gyurme dorje.   If you 
are interested in the writings of the present Dalai Lama, 
Nawang has developed a bibliography of the Dalai Lama�s 
writings which he will be glad to share with you.
