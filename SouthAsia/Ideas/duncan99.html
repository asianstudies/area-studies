electoral presence in northern India. It has been particularly successful in Uttar
Pradesh where it has participated in government three times in the 1990s. Although
the party seeks to mobilise the support of the 'bahujan'- the non-high caste majority of
the population - it is argued here, on the basis of aggregate and survey analysis, that it
has been constrained by its excessive reliance on just some sections of former
untouchables (Dalits). The Bahujan Samaj Party represents a significant social and

 <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"> INTRODUCTION</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman"> One of the most remarkable features of
the turbulent politics of north India in the 1990s has been the success of the recently
formed Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which has launched a new phase in the political
and electoral mobilisation of Dalits<A NAME="rf35.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N_35.1_"><SUP>(35.1)</SUP></A> in the region. There is of course nothing new
about social and political movements among the Dalits; such movements have played a
central role in the politics of India for more than a century.<A NAME="rf35.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N_35.2_"><SUP>(35.2)</SUP></A>  Among these, movements
and parties which have drawn inspiration from the life and political work of B.R.
Ambedkar have been particularly significant.<p>
          
What is distinctively new about the BSP is that it has achieved an electoral success,
particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), never experienced before by a political
party seeking to represent predominantly</FONT>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">the interests of ex-Untouchables. The
party has established itself as the preferred electoral choice of many of the poorest and
most marginalised sections of the north Indian population and specifically it has gained
the support of peasants and agricultural labourers in large numbers. It has been seen as
'the massive electoral participation of the untouchable "chamars" for the first time'
<I>[Srinivasulu, </I>1994: 159] and as a party specifically oriented towards the
Scheduled Castes that has generated a solidity and stability among its supporters
'which constitutes a fundamental change from the past' <I>[Brass, </I>1997: 2419]. In
the process of mobilising this following the party has contributed to a radical
realignment of social forces and created an autonomous political identity among the
Dalits that has cut away the support they were previously willing to give to other
parties. The decline in the influence of the Congress especially in UP, and the
subsequent reverses for the party nationally, can in large part be attributed to the loss
of much of its Dalit support base to the BSP in the 1990s. The unprecedented success
of the party can also be measured by the fact that it has been able, albeit in alliance
with or depending upon the support of other parties, to take power in governments in
UP on three occasions during the 1990s and in the process bring to power the first
Dalit Chief Minister of the state, Ms Mayawati. Although these administrations have
proved to be extremely unstable and short-lived they mark a dramatic break from the
pattern of coalitions of social forces that have ruled the state previously <I>[Duncan,
</I>1997b; <I>Prasad, </I>1995].<p>

Although the BSP has undoubtedly managed to generate the enthusiastic support and
loyalty of a wide range of the rural poor of UP it does not seem to have done so as a
consequence of any major campaigns or particular emphasis on issues affecting
landless labourers or marginal landholders as such. Rather its appeal and campaigning
appear to be far more caste based than class oriented and it has been primarily
concerned with issues of social oppression and exclusion than with those relating to
economic exploitation. One comment on its early activities remarked that 'the
mobilisation of the rural poor is seldom done on the issues emanating from capitalist
agriculture' <I>[Singh, </I>1993: 109] and other observers see the party as another
expression of the unprincipled factionalism characteristic of UP politics and not going
much beyond 'relatively narrow objectives such as caste-based reservations of public
sector employment' <I>[Dreze and Gazdar,</I> 1998: 104]. The BSP in this respect
can be seen as a part of the growing politicisation of caste in India in recent times that
has resulted in a changed focus of claims and demands on the part of mobilised groups
with more attention being given to social status and political power than to economic
advancement <I>[Kothari, </I>1994: 1590]. Although there is a substantial
congruence between class and caste and some observers <I>[Lieten: </I>1994] have
</FONT>  
<hr>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman"><b><i>DALITS AND POLITICS IN RURAL

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman"> interpreted the resurgence of caste
mobilisation as a surrogate form of class politics and others see caste as inextricably
bound up with relations of production and surplus extraction <I>[Omvedt, </I>1994a:
especially 21-58], the absence of any class based element in the strategy of the party
places severe limitations on the further expansion of the electoral appeal of the BSP.
Similarly the absence of any class based policy framework calls into question the
ability of the BSP in government to begin to remedy the profound economic
inequalities and poor performance of the state in issues of public policy.<p>

Whilst the solid core of support for the BSP certainly rests on its base among the
ex-untouchables, the party also aspires and claims to be a political expression and
social movement of the <I>Bahujan, </I>the majority, rather than just the vehicle of
the Dalits. Included among this potentially wider collectivity which the BSP seeks to
mobilise are the so-called Other Backward Classes (OBCs), these are the low but not
ex-untouchable caste groups, the Scheduled Tribes, and the Muslim population. The
extent to which it has succeeded in this respect will be a central concern of this
article.</FONT><p>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman"> DALITS IN THE RURAL ECONOMY
OF UP<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">THE general position of Dalits within the
pattern of social and economic relationships of north India is perhaps well known, but
it is worth outlining some of the details of their marginal social and economic position
as revealed by the most recent (1991) census figures. The various Scheduled Caste
(SC) groups in UP make up more than 23 per cent of the rural population, but they are
internally differentiated in a variety of ways. Of particular importance in UP is the
numerical preponderance of particular SC sub-groups. The Jatav/Chamar caste group
makes up more than half of the total Dalit population and is found in villages across
most of the state. The second largest group, the Pasis, form just under 15 per cent of
Dalits but they are much more geographically concentrated than the Jatavs. The Dalit
population is far less urbanised than the non-SCs and it has lower rates of literacy in
general with large differences between women and men and between rural and urban
areas. Taking the state of UP as a whole, the SC make up some 47 per cent of the
total landless labour force but only 18 per cent of the population of landowning
cultivators, although both of these proportions are subject to great regional variation.
Particularly noticeable is the high number of SC among landowners in the central
districts around Lucknow; in Lucknow district itself it is as high as 42 per cent
although again it needs to be emphasised that Dalits are found disproportionately
among the smaller landholders. On the other hand in the west the SC groups

are almost completely shut out from landownership; in Meerut district for example
they constitute less than 5 per cent of all cultivators. As Table I shows the proportion
of SC and non-SC working directly in agriculture (as cultivators or agricultural
labourers) does not differ to any great extent, but SC members are far more likely to
work as agricultural labourers than the non-SC who have a larger proportion of the
population working as landowning cultivators.</FONT><A NAME="rf38.3"></A>

be operating much smaller holdings than the non-SC and many of them returned in the
census as landholding cultivators are likely to be working as labourers as well.
Comprehensive contemporary data on comparative landholdings for the two
categories are not available for the various districts of the state but figures collected in
a 20 per cent sample survey during the 1961 Census give us some indication of the
degree of discrepancy in landownership, which if anything has probably increased since
then. As can be seen from Table 2 nearly 60 per cent of SC cultivating households
operated holdings of less than 2.5 acres compared to below 35 per cent for the non-SC
population. It should also be pointed out, in relation to these figures, that the approach
to the classification of landholders, conducted on the basis of cultivating households
rather than individual operational holdings, resulted in a significant underestimation of
the numbers cultivating the smallest holdings <I>[Brass, </I>1980: 405, 424]. The
1961 method of enumerating cultivating households reported 39 per cent under 2.5
acres <I>[Government of India,</I> 1966: 16-53] but the 1971 Agricultural Census
found 67 per cent of operational holdings under the roughly equivalent size of one

The brief account above of the position of the Dalits shows the extent to which the
various SC groups are typically to be found predominantly in the ranks of agricultural
labour or small landholders. As well as occupying an extremely precarious position in
the rural economy of the state, Dalit groups, despite undeniable improvements in their
social position in recent decades, are still firmly rooted to the bottom rung of the caste
hierarchy. In electoral terms the Dalits suffer from the further disadvantage that they
rarely form the numerically dominant caste in any part of UP and are typically evenly
spread and not found in the geographical concentrations that give other caste groups
electoral advantage in particular constituencies. Jatavs for example are usually found
as the second most numerous caste group in villages right across the state
<I>[Schwartzberg, </I>1965; <I>Schwartzberg,</I> 1968].<p>

 Any party seeking to mobilise Dalits as an electoral force faces formidable difficulties
given their position in the social and economic structure. These difficulties are
compounded when it also aspires to go further and recruit support from a wider
constituency of groups seen to be the subject of similar social oppression and
economic exploitation. In the past Ambedkarite Dalit parties, if at all successful, have
found themselves the subject of tempting offers of co-option from ruling parties at the
state and national level <I>[0ommen, </I>1984: 54], to which many have succumbed.
It is a common complaint that Dalit parties, and individual Dalit politicians, are all too
likely to become <I>chamcha, </I>puppets or stooges, of dominant interests once they
begin to have any degree of electoral success. In response to this there has emerged a
strong insistence on autonomy and organisational independence in contemporary
Ambedkarite social and political movements which often appear to behave in an
openly hostile</FONT><hr>

manner even to sympathetic potential allies <I>[Kothari, </I>1994: 1593;
<I>Duncan,</I> 1997b:986].<p>

 Dalit political parties are also constantly vulnerable to the accusation that they are
'casteist' and aware that if they are too successful in consolidating a particular caste
group they may appear to be exclusive and uninterested in the welfare of others. The
dilemma was stated clearly by one of the BSP leadership in 1991 when he addressed
an Ambedkar anniversary rally: 'It is possible to consolidate the Harijan vote, but that
will not suit my purpose. If the Harijans vote overwhelmingly for the BSP it might
alienate other components of the <I>Bahujan </I>like Muslims and Backwards. I am
trying to unite all these social groups.' <A NAME="rf40.4"></A>
<A HREF="#N_40.4_"><SUP>(40.4)</SUP></A>  The remainder of this article looks at the extent
to which the BSP has succeeded in this aim in the context of its performance in UP in
the elections it has contested since 1989.<p></FONT>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman"> ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF
THE BSP<BR><BR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
The origins of the BSP can be traced to the formation in the late 1970s of the
Backward and Minority Central Government Employees Federation (BAMCEF). This
organisation had started in 1971 as a co-ordinating committee of Dalits based in a
government scientific research institute in Pune and the key figure in its leadership was
Kanshi Ram. Initially conceived as a loosely structured body putting Dalit government
employees in touch with each other, by the late 1970s the organisation had expanded
and become more formally structured with a central office in Delhi, regular
publications and a programme of activities and campaigns which emphasised the
importance of self-activity by Dalits and allied groups <I>[Joshi, </I>1987; <I>Pai,
</I>1993: 63-7; <I>Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I>1998: 218-26]. Kanshi Ram
represented a tendency within BAMCEF that advocated giving priority to electoral
participation and for this purpose he formed an allied organisation popularly known as
DS-4 (Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti) in 1981 which contested elections in
Haryana in 1982. The launch of the BSP followed in 1984 and it seems that these
organisational transformations were accompanied by considerable internal party strife
<I>[Joshi, </I>1987:92; <I>Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I>1998: 222].<p>

In the Legislative Assembly (UP state government) elections held in March 1985 the
BSP contested the majority of the seats and although its overall performance was not
impressive (it polled something like 2.5 per cent of the vote) the results showed that an
organisation with the ability to mount a serious electoral challenge had been forged.<A NAME="rf40.5"></A>
<A HREF="#N_40.5_"><SUP>(40.5)</SUP></A>  It
was also the first evidence that the BSP had successfully been transformed from a
body primarily based upon urban government employees to one which could sustain a
political and electoral organisation in the hinterland of the Indian
</FONT><hr>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
 countryside. In December 1985 the BSP performance in the Bijnor Lok Sabha
by-election provided the first evidence that the party also had the capacity to influence
the outcome of, and possibly win, Parliamentary and Assembly contests. In a high
profile campaign with two very well-known Dalit candidates (Meira Kumar and Ram
Vilas Paswan) standing for the Congress and the main opposition party, Ms Mayawati,
by now the major BSP figure in UP, took nearly one-fifth of the vote and her
intervention contributed to a reduction of the Congress majority from 100,000 to just
5,000.<A NAME="rf41.6"></A>
<A HREF="#N_41.6_"><SUP>(41.6)</SUP></A><p>  

Mayawati comes from a Jatav/Chamar family which moved to Delhi after living in
western UP. The family was involved in Ambedkarite politics but the extent of this
activity is not clear. She gained degrees from Meerut University and later a further law
degree from Delhi University. Mayawati first met Kanshi Ram when she was a student
in 1977 and after working as a teacher she gave up her job in 1984 to become a
full-time activist for the BSP. From an early stage her political ability and commitment
impressed just about everyone with whom she came into contact. As the former
Governor of UP was later to remark: 'Her political antennae are indeed very finely
tuned. She has a political sense and uncanny intuitive reactions' <I>[Bhandari,
</I>1998: 172]. Mayawati strengthened her claim to the leadership of Dalit politics in
UP in March 1987 when she contested another Lok Sabha by-election in Hardwar and
came second to Congress and took nearly one-third of the total vote. In a series of
Assembly by-elections held at the same time the BSP on average polled 25 per cent of
the vote. Kanshi Ram also entered the election fray in UP when he stood in the highly
publicised by-election in Allahabad in June 1988, where most attention focused on the
contest between former defence minister V.P. Singh, recently expelled from the
Congress, and the Congress candidate. Kanshi Ram polled 72,000 votes in a
constituency where the BSP nominee had received only 1,700 votes in the previous
election.<p>

Whilst these election results provided valuable publicity for the BSP and a great fillip
for Dalit activists the party still needed to show it could perform consistently in general
elections when its resources were stretched across the countryside in a state-wide
campaign. Any assessment of the subsequent overall performance of the BSP during
the late 1980s and 1990s is made difficult by the complicated pattern of alliances
entered into by the party in Legislative Assembly elections; with the Samajwadi Party
in 1993 and with Congress in 1996. The pattern is simpler for elections to the Lok
Sabha where the party stood in its own right with just a few minor seat adjustments.
As can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 the BSP has enjoyed steadily rising electoral
popularity throughout the 1990s but seems to have reached a plateau of support at
around 20 per cent of the vote and still</FONT><hr>

<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
experiences considerable problems in converting votes into a proportional share of
seats. This plateau was probably reached, in terms of general popular support rather
than actual votes, around the 1993 election when the small number of candidates
standing, as a consequence of the electoral alliance with the Samajwadi Party, reduced
its share of the overall vote. The evidence for this general level of support seems to be
confirmed by results in the pattern of results for by-elections and for elections to rural
local bodies held in May 1994 and April/May 1995 and for elections to urban councils
in November 1995 </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman">

The increasing popularity of the BSP from the late 1980s onwards made it an
attractive potential partner for other parties seeking electoral alliances and coalitions
of sufficient numbers of members in the Legislative Assembly to form a government. It
was also the case that in the finely balanced electoral politics of UP in the 1990s the
popular support for the BSP and its presence in the legislature in significant strength
gave it a greater importance than would normally have been the case.<A NAME="rf42.7"></A>

election campaign it formed an alliance with the Samajwadi Party of Mulayam Singh
Yadav and agreed to stand in less than half the seats it had contested in 1991 (see
Table 4). It was a tactical move that paid dividends as the alliance came to power as a
coalition government. But co-operation was short-lived as acrimony and mutual
suspicion increased and eventually in June 1995 Mayawati withdrew from the coalition
<I>[Duncan, </I> 1997b]. She then
formed a government of the BSP alone, supported from outside by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), that lasted just over four months. In the next elections to the State
Assembly held in 1996 the BSP sprang another tactical surprise by forming an alliance
with the Congress. Even more remarkable was the agreement of Congress to act as the
junior partner by fielding only 126 candidates leaving 296 seats for the BSP. No party
could form a government until March 1997 when the BSP once again surprised
everyone by forming a coalition government with the BJP, with the added innovation
that the office of Chief Minister was to be rotated every six months. Mayawati became
Chief Minister for the second time, completed six months in office, handed over to the
BJP in September but then withdrew from the government just one month later. <p>

In just four years the BSP had been in either electoral alliances or government
coalitions with every other major political party in the state. Whilst this record may
seem contradictory and opportunistic it is in fact entirely consistent with the view held
by Kanshi Ram and Mayawati that all other considerations must be subordinated to the
paramount concern that Dalits should take every opportunity to exercise political
power. For Kanshi Ram 'expenditure of effort on any object other than the capture of
government is seen to be superfluous' <I>[Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I> 1998: 223] 
and when in government the BSP relentlessly pursued projects to promote the Dalit
identity and presence in public life. To this end in its three periods of government it has
initiated such programmes as the installation of thousands of statues of Ambedkar in
towns and villages across the state and the creation of a massive commemorative
Ambedkar Park in the state capital Lucknow. This project, still uncompleted and the
subject of judicial enquiries, was estimated to have cost over f 14 million and
Mayawati as Chief Minister ordered that work was to continue round the clock in an
effort to complete the park <I>[Bhandari, </I> 1998: 168]. The Mayawati regimes
also saw massive transfers of civil servants and police personnel, a common practice in
UP, but on a scale that led the then Governor of UP to conclude that there 'was no
doubt that officers of the Scheduled Caste had been favoured' <I>[Bhandari, </I>
1998: 170; also <I>Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I> 1998: 228-9]. <p>

There were however other more tangible material benefits as a consequence of the
BSP periods of government. Whilst some aspects of the</FONT><hr>

government's policy of transfer of officials may have been questionable, in the eyes of
many Dalits Mayawati had done them a service by replacing officials who were
perceived to have been corrupt <I>[Pai and Singh, </I>1997: 1358] and she 'dealt

people in a particular District' <I>[Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I>1998: 229]. The
Governor of UP later wrote that on her frequent trips to inspect District
administrations it was rare that a visit ended without an officer being sacked or
transferred <I>[Bhandari, </I>1998: 169]. The Mayawati governments also expanded
the special welfare and development programme of the 'Ambedkar Villages'. These
villages were chosen on the basis of having a high proportion of Dalit inhabitants and
received special infrastructural development funds that were usually spent in the Dalit
quarters of the villages on public amenities and housing <I>[Pai,</I> 1997: 2314].
Over 25,000 Ambedkar villages in UP were designated and participation in the scheme
was often cited by Dalits as a reason for supporting the BSP [Brass, 1997: 2415].
Sometimes land that had been allotted to Dalits many years before, but never actually
transferred, was finally handed over during the Mayawati regime <I>[Pai and Singh,
</I>1997: 1358]. Overall there can be no doubt that during the periods of Mayawati's
tenure as Chief Minister she pushed forward programmes and projects that were both
symbolically and practically relevant to the Dalit population of the state and by so
doing contributed further to the construction of a wider and more robust and
self-confident Dalit identity across the state.<p> 

The efforts of the BSP in government were complemented by the mobilising work of a
dedicated cadre of activists at the grass roots. The local level activities of the BSP
need to be located within the broader context of the general social movements of
which the political and electoral campaigning of the BSP were just one part. In
particular, if we see social movements to be 'sustained interactions between aggrieved
social actors and allies, and opponents and public authorities' <I>[Tarrow, </I>1994:
33] then India has witnessed a spectacular growth in the social movements of Dalits in
recent decades. At present what has become known as 'Ambedkarisation' -- 'the
tremendous growth in the consciousness among Dalits about the life and ideas of
Ambedkar' <I>[Pai, </I>1997: 2314] - has been the subject of some studies
<I>[Zelliot, </I>1992; <I>Omvedt, </I>1994b; <I>Kothari, </I>1994] but nothing has
been produced on the scale of the equivalent work done on rural social movements in,
say, Latin America <I>[Foweraker, </I>1995; <I>Veltmeyer, </I>1997]. Indeed with
very few exceptions <I>[Routledge, </I>1996] the new social movements approach
has received very little attention in relation to India.<p>

At the heart of the BSP organisation, and the wider movement of Ambedkarisation, at
the grass roots level is a cadre of dedicated local activists who have been characterised
as young, politically conscious, better</FONT><hr>

educated and upwardly mobile <I>[Pai and Singh, </I>1997: 1359]. Kanchan Chandra
on the basis of her observations across seven states during the 1996 election campaign
states that the BSP workers at the local level consist mainly of Scheduled Caste and
other lower caste activists 'in whom anger against the upper castes and the idealism of
social transformation is deeply rooted' <I>[Chandra and Parmar, </I>1997: 216]. The
activist cadre has assumed a crucial role in the leadership of village level politics and
act as the intellectuals of their caste group, questioning all aspects of the social order
and taking a decisive role in mobilising their castes especially in political matters
<I>[Pai and Singh, </I>1997: 1359].<p> 

Party workers for the BSP have proved to be inventive and innovative in their
approach to social and political mobilisation. Joshi [1987: 91] reports that BAMCEF
had established 'Awakening Squads' who used song, informal drama and poster
displays to spread the message of the organisation across the country. V.B. Singh
[1992: 250] describes the campaigning of the party in Azamgarh and says that as early
as 1989 BSP activists had adopted novel and effective methods, including forming
theatre groups aimed at dramatising the position of the Dalits and exposing the
oppressive role of the upper castes. The BSP continued the tradition of earlier
Ambedkarite organisations by encouraging its followers to use a whole number of
rhythmic couplets and chants on public processions and demonstrations. Many of these
were deeply offensive to the upper castes and, although they provided huge
amusement and enjoyment to the Dalit participants, were hardly likely to assist in the
construction of a wider political alliance.<A NAME="rf45.8"></A>
<A HREF="#N_45.8_"><SUP>(45.8)</SUP></A> Processions through public areas were often
initiated to coincide with the installation of new Ambedkar statues and the designation
of Ambedkar villages and became an important means by which the BSP symbolically
asserted the new role of Dalits in the public arena.<p>

 The electoral performance of the BSP can be analysed from a variety of perspectives
and there exist a number of very useful studies based both on survey and aggregate
data. By far the most impressive information based on survey data comes from the
work conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) in Delhi.

1996 Lok Sabha election was supplemented by a further study conducted to coincide

 sample reporting that they voted for the BSP, almost 20 per cent above the
proportion of the very poor supporting any other party, and the BSP vote showed a
greater skewness towards the poor than any other major party. The survey also found
around 65 per cent of the Scheduled Caste population supporting the party with even
higher support (74 per cent) among the Jatav/Chamar caste group.<A NAME="rf46.10"></A>
<A HREF="#N_46.10_"><SUP>(46.10)</SUP></A> The CSDS data
also reveal significant support for the BSP among some OBC groups. On the other
hand the survey suggests that only around 2 per cent of the non-SC population
supported the BSP. The figures from the Legislative Assembly election survey show a
very similar pattern. These findings are supported by other more locally based surveys
and village studies. For example Brass [1997: 2415-16] reports overwhelming support
for the BSP in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections on the part of Jatavs/Chamars, but less
enthusiastic support from the Pasis in central UP. The study of four villages in western
UP by Pai and Singh [1997] completed before and after the 1996 Lok Sabha elections
reveals almost total support for the BSP from the Jatavs. My own impression during
visits to districts of western UP and Ruhelkand in December 1997 and March 1998,
both before and after the 1998 general election, was entirely the same. Indeed it is hard
to disagree with Brass that talking to villagers in UP these days about their voting
behaviour tends to produce predictable statements, particularly in relation to the
electoral preferences of particular caste groups, and no great surprises [Brass, 1997:
2408].<p> 

<I><b>Consistency and Continuity of Support</b></I><BR>

The apparent consistency of the support for the BSP is remarkable given its shifting
alliances for elections in the period being considered. As pointed out before, in
national elections for the Lok Sabha between 1989 and 1998 it has contested without
allies, but in elections for the state-level Legislative Assembly it stood alone in 1989
and 1991, in alliance with the Samajwadi Party in 1993 and with the Congress in 1996.
It should also be remembered that during this period it also entered government
coalitions first with the Samajwadi Party and later with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party. In spite of this series of rapid realignments which must have tested the
loyalty and understanding of even the most dedicated enthusiasts of the party it seems
to have carried the core of support with it on its tactical journey. Brass [1997: 2415,
2419] analysing the BSP share of the vote in individual Lok Sabha constituencies in
elections between 1989 and 1996 finds the vote for the party to be highly stable and
argues that it is transferable when it forms alliances with other parties.<A NAME="rf46.11"></A>
<A HREF="#N_46.11_"><SUP>(46.11)</SUP></A> The following
tables present the data in a different way from Brass, but strongly support his
conclusions about the consistency of the BSP vote and also include the results from
the 1998 Lok Sabha elections and from Legislative Assembly</FONT><hr>

like every other political party in UP over the last ten years the BSP is subject to a
high turnover in individual constituencies. In Lok Sabha elections since 1989 it has
managed only once to retain a seat won in the previous general election (Akbarpur in
1998); the turnover in LA seats is shown in Table 6, but again this needs to be
interpreted in the context of the shifting pattern of election alliances.<p>

 <I><b>Regional Patterns of Support</b></I> <br>

The evidence for the consistency of BSP support has to be appreciated in relation to a
marked unevenness in the patterns of its electoral performance across the state. The
persistence of particular regional strengths and weaknesses in elections from 1989
onwards is one particularly noticeable dimension of this unevenness. In the four
Legislative Assembly elections since 1989 the BSP has consistently performed well in
some of the districts of the eastern region and in the southern plateau region of the
Bundelkhand. On the other hand it has performed consistently badly in a number of
districts in central UP and in the western region.<A NAME="rf49.13"></A>
<A HREF="#N_49.13_"><SUP>(49.13)</SUP></A>  The districts where it performed
well<A NAME="rf49.14"></A>
<A HREF="#N_49.14_"><SUP>(49.14)</SUP></A> nearly all have 
above average proportions of SC population and Jatavs/Chamars
are the predominant grouping; in Azamgarh, for example, they form the highest
proportion of the SC of any district in the state. The exception is Allahabad where the
Jatavs are about equal in numbers ' to the Pasis. The agrarian structure across these
districts shows no particular distinctive pattern. In the districts where the BSP has
polled poorly<A NAME="rf49.15"></A>
<A HREF="#N_49.15_"><SUP>(49.15)</SUP></A> there are 
similarly some features which stand out. In three of the
districts the Jatavs are not the most numerous Dalit caste group; Pasis predominate in
Lucknow and Rae Bareli and Koris in Gonda; apart from these three districts only one
other in the state has a lower proportion of Jatavs in the Dalit population. Four other
districts with poor support for the BSP are in the western agriculturally prosperous
region where the SC do form a substantial section of the population and the Jatavs are
the predominant group among them.<p>

 The failure of the BSP to establish a stronger electoral presence in the western
districts of the state needs to be looked at more closely. It is particularly puzzling as
this region is where movements representing the Ambedkarite tradition have found
strong support in the past among the substantial Jatav population. Indeed in the 1960s
it was the region of UP where the Republican Party of India had its best successes.
Part of the answer is to be found in the way in which Congress and the Janata Dal,
despite their general decline in the 1990s, managed to maintain some influence in this
part of the state. Other explanations have drawn attention to the poor Organisation of
the BSP in the west and Mayawati's role in it and to the continuing influence of the
veteran Jatav campaigner and Congress</FONT><hr>

activist B.P. Maurya. His long association with the Congress, after starting his political
life in the Ambedkarite Republican Party, was given a higher profile when he was
made one of the Vice-Presidents of the All India Congress Committee
<I>[Mendelsohn and Vicziany, </I>1998: 225].<A NAME="rf50.16"></A>
<A HREF="#N_50.16_"><SUP>(50.16)</SUP></A> Whilst these factors may have had
some influence there also seem to be some deeper Structural features which could
explain the differences in the performance of the BSP in the east and west.<p>

The contrasting experiences of scheduled caste agricultural labourers in the east and
west of the state has been closely studied by Jens Lerche [1994, 1995, 1998] who
challenges the often cited orthodoxy that the economic development experienced in
the west, 'dynamic-capitalist', has resulted in a better position for agricultural workers
there than those in the eastern 'semi feudal' system. He stresses the need to locate local
level struggles within the framework of broader relationships and particularly within
the regional balance of power. In particular he points out that the pattern of land
reform and caste relations has created a tension between former landlords and smaller
landowners in the east and consequently a more fluid context in which agricultural
labourers find room for manoeuvre and bargaining. In the west the dominance of
established landholders was cemented in place by the pattern of agrarian reforms and
subsequent agricultural development. In this region agricultural labourers find limited
scope for economic bargaining or political activity within the 'village republics'
dominated by the pervasive well organised landholding interests.<A NAME="rf50.17"></A>
<A HREF="#N_50.17_"><SUP>(50.17)</SUP></A>  In fact one
commentator has gone as far as arguing that agricultural labourers in reality hardly
exist in much of the western region at all and those recorded by the census have no
stable or permanent relationship with the landed peasant proprietors for whom they
work only intermittently <I>[Gupta, </I>1992: 165]. <p>

Lerche provides important insights into the different political economies of rural areas
in the east and west and useful insights into possible reasons for the differential
performance of the BSP. It is also undoubtedly the case that the Scheduled Castes are
locked out of the landholding community in many western areas. Apart from the hill
areas of UP the lowest proportion of scheduled caste landowners are to be found in
some of the Jat dominated districts of the west.<A NAME="rf50.18"></A>
<A HREF="#N_50.18_"><SUP>(50.18)</SUP></A> There is also evidence that in spite of
impressive economic advances in the west the region remains socially backward and
fares no better than the east in a whole range of available indicators of well being and
social advancement and indeed may well lag behind in terms of child mortality and
gender equality <I>[Dreze and Gazdar, </I>1998]. The general impression of a
dynamic west and a stagnant east also needs to be appreciated in the light of some
evidence suggesting that the east has in fact experienced considerable advances in
some aspects of agricultural development <I>[Alagh, </I>1988: 35; <I>Sharma and
Poleman, </I>1994: 42; <I>Duncan,</I><FONT><hr>

 1997a: 254-7]. However even in the west the BSP may now be beginning to establish
a presence and breaking through in this difficult environment. In the 1991 Lok Sabha
elections the party polled less than 200,000 votes across the region, by 1998 it gained
more than 1.7 million votes. This was partly a consequence of standing in more seats
but if only those seats in the region where it stood in both elections are taken into 
account then its share of the vote rose from 5.5 per cent in 199 1 to 22.3 per cent in
1998, far more than the increase in the state-wide average.<p>

 <I><b>Social and Economic Basis of Rural Support</b></I><br>

The evidence discussed above suggests that while the BSP may have aspired to
mobilise a <I>Bahujan </I>identity in reality it remains primarily a party of the SC, and
perhaps more accurately, a party only of some sections of the SC.<A NAME="rf51.19"></A>
<A HREF="#N_51.19_"><SUP>(51.19)</SUP></A> Studies of all kinds
and at all levels suggest that the BSP was overwhelmingly the party of the Jatavs in
UP and that in terms of campaigning and support it remained trapped within the
confines of the Jatav caste group. Village level studies indicate this and more general
surveys support this view. There is some evidence that sections of the OBCs support
the party but other studies show particular OBC groups antagonistic to what they see
as a Dalit monopoly of the benefits of the periods of BSP rule <I>[Pai and Singh,
</I>1997] There are few studies, at the aggregate level, which investigate - the social
and economic support base of the BSP. Pai in her work on the Legislative Assembly
elections of 1989 adopts an interesting methodological approach in an attempt to
isolate the specifically rural patterns of political preference. She finds little evidence of
any support for the BSP among marginal and small landowners but does not
investigate the question of support for the BSP among agricultural labourers or the
pattern of support among different caste groups [Pai, 1993]. The Lok Sabha elections
where the BSP contested without alliances with other parties would provide useful
data for ecological analysis but Lok Sabha constituencies do not coincide with other
administrative units for which there are numerous socio-economic data. The district,
which always corresponds to an aggregate of Legislative Assembly constituencies, is
also the level at which a whole range of social and economic data are collected and is
therefore chosen here as the unit of study. It isn't perfect, particularly as it provides
only a limited sample size across the state, and is, as a consequence of administrative
reform, constantly being revised. The following analysis is conducted on the basis of
district aggregates of socio-economic data and election results<p>

On the basis of the evidence discussed so far it seems that there is a range of issues
concerning the electoral performance of the BSP in rural areas worth investigating by
means of aggregate ecological analysis. First</FONT><hr>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman"><b>52 <i>THE JOURNAL OF PEASANT
STUDIES</i></b><BR><BR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
there is the question of support for the BSP among the rural poor. Among this group
are included agricultural labourers and cultivators of small landholdings. The
proportion of agricultural labourers in the agricultural workforce in the 1991 census is
taken as the relevant figure here and is preferred to the proportion in the total
workforce in order to minimise the 'urban bias' in Districts with large urban
populations and a high proportion of non-agricultural workers. In addition, in order to
isolate the specifically rural patterns of electoral behaviour, those Legislative Assembly
constituencies with substantial urban populations, a total of 58, have been removed
from the aggregate totals. The proportion of SC and non-SC agricultural labourers are
considered separately. Three categories of landholding cultivators are included in the
analysis: the proportion cultivating less than a half hectare, the proportion between a
half and one hectare, and the proportion between one and two hectares. Unfortunately
no recent data at the district level are available separately for SC and non-SC
landholders, but reference will be made to the available older data.<p>

Second, there is the question of support for the BSP among the SC in general and
among particular caste groups. As survey and village level research indicates, there has
been particularly strong support for the BSP among Jatavs/Chamars, the largest
proportion of this caste group. The other non-Jatav/Chamar SC, as well as the SC in
general are considered here. For the general SC population figures the 1991 census
data are used, for the proportions of individual SC groups only 1961 data are
available, but this is reasonably reliable.<p>

<I>(i) Agricultural labour: </I>As Table 9 shows support for the BSP in rural areas
before 1996 does seem to be associated with the proportion of agricultural labourers
in the workforce, but the association is not apparent in the election of that year. The
grounds for seeing this as an important indicator of BSP support need to be tempered
by the fact that correlations at the regional level do not show consistent patterns. The
regional correlations are not presented here but only in Ruhelkhand, Bundelkhand and
the Lower Doab are consistent patterns of strong association apparent. However when
the SC and non-SC components of the agricultural labour force are considered
separately a quite different pattern emerges with strong and significant correlations of
the BSP vote with SC agricultural labourers but no such relationship with the numbers
of non-SC agricultural labourers. This general pattern also holds across the various
regions of the state when they are considered separately. On the basis of this evidence
there seem to be good grounds to suggest that whatever support there was for the
BSP among agricultural labourers this was coming disproportionately from those
belonging to the SC.</FONT><hr>

<I>(ii) Small landholders: </I>The correlation matrix for the BSP vote in rural areas
and the proportion of smaller landowners in different categories is given in Table 10.
There is no need to discuss these results extensively as they point to the same sort of
conclusion as those reached by Pai 119931 in her study of the 1989 election. It
appears from the evidence of aggregate analysis that there is no discernible association
between the level of support for the BSP and the pattern of distribution of
landholdings among smaller landowners. Neither do the results for individual regions
demonstrate any particular pattern and certainly no evidence for support for the BSP
among the landed poor. Older data giving the distribution of landholdings by size for
the SC and non-SC separately have also been analysed and they too produce no
evidence that the BSP has established any sort of distinctive support base among either

<I>(iii) Caste:</I> The evidence for a strong association between proportion

the BSP is apparent in the correlation matrix presented in Table 11. However, what is
also clear is that these data are heavily influenced by the large proportion of the Jatavs
in the SC population. Table 11 also shows that if  the Jatav and non-Jatav population
are considered separately then support for the BSP among the Scheduled Castes
appears to be confined to the Jatavs. Again regional figures are not given in detail but
all correlations of Jatavs/Chamar rural population with the BSP vote are high, positive
and, with the exception of the west and the lower Doab, significant (at the five per
cent level).The regional pattern for support among the non-Jatavs shows broadly a
negative correlation with exception of the lower Doab which shows strong support for
the BSP among non-Jatav SC. There appears to be very strong evidence that the BSP
has certainly built a strong following among the Dalits of UP but that this is restricted
to the Jatav caste group with little evidence of general support from other sections of
the Scheduled Castes, although it is possible that individual non-Jatav Scheduled
castes did support the party.</FONT><p>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
The arrival of the BSP has transformed the political landscape of UP. It has made
enormous steps in terms of the construction of a new political identity for the SC and
it has succeeded in electoral politics to an extent not seen before. The party has played
a central role in this construction as a consequence of its own practice in political
mobilisation and through its conduct and policy in government. It has benefited many
thousands of Dalits through reservations and village programmes. None of this can be
underestimated; but in terms of its own stated objective of creating a wider alliance of
the <I>bahujan</I>  it seems to be stalled. Neither is it altogether clear</FONT><hr>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Times Roman"><b><i>DALITS AND POLITICS IN RURAL

</FONT><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Times Roman">
that it has managed to consolidate the Dalits of UP to the extent it would wish and the
evidence presented here suggests that like other Ambedkarite movements before,
particularly the Republican Party, it relies disproportionately on the support of  a 
single caste group.<p>

 In the present political conjuncture of  Uttar Pradesh, and India more generally, the
targeting of particular caste groups for political mobilisation remains an attractive
prospect for any party or movement. It is often the case that by emphasising the
particular aspects of a caste that it has in common with others and by creating
ambiguity and blurring the edges of what separates one caste from another, more
generalised identities and political collectivities can be constructed through political
action initially based on caste. The recent political history of UP has seen at least one
such example, the succession of parties led by Charan Singh, of the construction of a
state wide peasant and farmer identity which both utilised and transcended caste
identities and at the same time created a collectivity of rural interests of substantially
different economic positions <I>[Duncan, </I> 1997a]. The important issue is not so
much the political expression of caste identity but what caste can become and how it is
perceived as a consequence of its mobilisation in the political arena through the
purposeful activities of parties and movements. On the other hand social movements
and political parties can become so obliged to emphasise the particularistic
characteristics of a caste group, in order to establish themselves or to survive in the
world of electoral realities, and the BSP for all its radical and subversive rhetoric is
totally committed to institutional politics, that they remain ensnared and trapped within
the confines of narrow caste politics. For the moment the BSP is following the second
of these alternatives.</FONT><p>

The term 'Dalit' is used by
many members of ex-Untouchable caste
groups to refer to THEmselves in
preference to Harijan or Scheduled Caste or a variety of 
other terms and for  that reason
I use it here. It is, however, open to some ambiguity as it is often used to refer to 
a wider section of the population than those 
administratively designated as Scheduled Castes. 
 I am using the term here to refer to the ex-Untouchables 
caste groups and those officially  
 recognised as Scheduled Castes.  [<a  href="#rf35.1">Back</a>]<BR>

<b>8. </b></a> The Arnbedkarite movement has a
long tradition of inventive and often provocative chanting of couplets on
demonstrations and processions. In the 1960s supporters of the Republican  Party,
then the main vehicle of Ambedkarite politics, were sometimes brought to trial after 
election campaigns charged with seeking to win votes on the basis of caste or religion
-- an  offence under Indian Election Law - by chanting slogans with a heavy caste
content. Some  of these cases reached the Allahabad High Court <I>[Government of
Uttar Pradesh, </I>1962-65:  12.5.62, 26,5.62, 15.2.64, 29.2.64, 30.5.64, 12.12.64,
23.1.65.1 and are therefore well documented. One such slogan was <I>Thakur,
Brahman aur Lalal Kardo inka munha kola  </I> (Thakurs, Brahmans and Banias /
make their faces black). The exhortation is to disgrace the high castes (by blackening
their faces), and at the same time it is a statement of the Jatav accusation that they are
labelled black by the supposedly fairer-skinned higher castes. This   is emphasised by
the rhyming <I>Lalalkala </I>where <I>kala </I>means black and <I>Lala </I>as well
as being   a vernacular expression for Banias (usually traders) also means red. Another
well known   chant at the time <I>Jatav Muslim bhai bhailHindu kaum kehan se aye
</I>(Jatavs and Muslims are   brothers/Where do these Hindus come from?) reflected
the Republican alliance with   Muslims at the time and the belief of some Jatavs that
they were the original inhabitants of   India conquered by invading high castes.
<B>The BSP </B>supporters continue this tradition and take   up similar themes.
Particularly popular with activists at the moment is <I>Tilak, taraju aur  </I> 
<I>talwarllsko maro jute char. </I>The call once again is to disgrace the high caste
Brahmans,   Banias and Thakiirs by beating them with shoes, but with the added irony
that leather   working and making shoes is the traditional caste occupation of the
Jatav/Chamars. See also   Mendelsohn and Vicziany [1998: 223]. [<a  href="#rf45.8">Back</a>]<BR>

northern areas of the state bordering UP where the Jatav/Chamar caste group   are
found in large numbers. In elections for the Lok Sabha it won one seat in 1991 which
it   retained in 1996 in addition to winning one more. Both these seats however were
lost in 1998. Its share of the vote in Lok Sabha elections has also risen steadily (1991
- 3.5 per cent, 1996 - 8.2 per cent, 1999 - 8.7 per cent) Its performance in individual
Lok Sabha constituencies where it stood candidates in all three elections shows a
highly significant degree of correlation (1991-96 .8145; 1991-98 .8196; 1996-98

 <b>Quest for Power: Oppositional Movements and Post-Congress  Politics in Uttar
Pradesh.</b> By Zoya Hasan. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998. 292 p.
$24.95. <p align=right>Leela Fernandes, <I>Rutgers University</I> <p>

Contemporary politics in India poses a unique case for the study of economic and
political transitions in comparative contexts. In contrast to cases in regions such as
Eastern Europe and Latin America, which have been characterizedby both the
economic transition from state planning to liberalized economies and the political
transition of  democratization, India's nascent economic reforms have been  initiated
within the political context of a parliamentary  democracy. In the Indian context,
political transition appears to reside in growing democratic instability with the
successive fall of fragile central governments and the rise of exclusivist Hindu
nationalist political forces. Zoya Hasan's <I>Quest for  Power is </I>a compelling
analysis of contemporary Indian  politics and suggests that such instability represents a
structural political transition as India shifts away from a national system dominated by
the Congress Party in the postindependence period. The appearance of political
disorder, as the book demonstrates, conceals a deeper process of grassroots political 
democratization within the context of a formal democracy. <p>

  The central argument of <I>Quest for Power is </I>that India's political transition
must be understood as a structural shift in the relationship between state and civil
society. Hasan argues that the failure of the state to change the material and social
conditions of marginalized sectors of society and the  exclusion of these groups from
the Congress Party's centralized power structure led to the independent political
mobilization of new social constituencies. According to Hasan, this  mobilization has
placed historically marginalized groups at the center of the political system at both the
local and national level and has led to the decline of the Congress Party. <p>

  Drawing on archival research, government reports,  qualitative interviews, and
secondary sources, the book examines contemporary politics in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh, which has played a critical role in shaping both national political
discourses and electoral politics. Hasan presents a comprehensive analysis of the
declining political fortunes of the Congress Party in this state and the rise of three
critical social movements that have effectively challenged it: a  farmers movement,
mobilization of "backward castes," and the Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) movement.
This focus moves away from the traditional assumption that these social groups are
merely passive votebanks manipulated by political leaders. <p>

  Hasan demonstrates that the decline of the Congress Party stemmed in large part
from its inability to accommodate newsocial groups demanding a voice in both the
local and national political system. The unwillingness of the local Congress
organization to broaden its upper-caste base to include the socially mobile backward
castes (p. 38) and the Congress Party's "pragmatic communalism" (p. 235)  provided
the political space for both the rise of regional parties and the emergence of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a powerful national force. Hasan analyzes the social
factors and local political processes that have allowed new regional political parties in
Uttar Pradesh, such as the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP),
to displace the Congress and claim to represent the interests of social groups, such as
backward castes and Muslim constituencies. <p>

  The significance of the book is underlined by recent political events. Both the BSP
and the SP played a critical role in the recent fall of the BJP coalition government. In
1999, the BSP's last-minute, unanticipated vote against the BJP led to the fall, and the
SP's refusal to support the Congress Party prevented the return of a Congress-led
government. Hasan examines the socioeconomic and  historical processes that have led
to this regionalization of Indian politics, which enables local parties to affect
substantially the direction of national electoral politics. <p>

  The emphasis on the significance of social mobilization and the effects of expanded
political participation lend an  important and timely perspective to current debates on
India's "crisis of govern ability" (see Atul Kohli, ed., <I>Democracy and  Discontent:
India's Growing Crisis of Governability, </I>1994). Hasan's argument recasts this
debate by suggesting that what 

<hr>
Book Reviews: COMPARATIVE POLITICS December 1999, p.1000<p>

appears as a crisis of democratic instability is in fact a case of growing democratic
political participation. India's crisis of governability, ironically, reflects a process that is
firmly linked to the electoral politics of parliamentary democracy. <p>

  A particular strength of <I>Quest for Power is </I>its refusal toromanticize the
political activism of the peasant and caste based social groups. Hasan examines the
complex social and economic hierarchies that led to the marginalization and
subsequent mobilization of these groups, but she also points to the limits of such
mobilization. For instance, she argues that it has restructured the political world but
has not had a similar effect on class-based structural inequality. On the contrary, it
primarily benefits backward caste groups that have already acquired economic clout
(p. 163). Hasan also argues that rural mobilization of farmers in Uttar Pradesh was
"class driven" (p. 97), as the leadership was oriented toward the rich and middle
peasantry (for a contrasting perspective, see Ashustosh Varshney, <I>Democracy, 
Development and the Countryside, </I>1995). <p>

  The book's analysis of shifting social relations and its departure from purely statist
approaches hold potential insights for understanding the ways in which grassroots
social movements affect national political transitions in  comparative contexts. Yet,
because the book does not have a  generalized theoretical framework or discussion, it
will be of interest mainly to scholars of contemporary Indian politics. In addition, the
emphasis on political processes within civil society at points results in an
overestimatation of the "retreat of the state" and the corresponding decline of the
Nehruvian project (p. 3) in the past two decades. The current halting pace of economic
reforms, for instance, demonstrates the need for a qualification of this potential retreat.
More important, the state still remains a major employer. In fact, instances of political
mobilization examined in the book often involve caste-based claims for reservations in
government employment (p. 152). Such demands tend to represent an extension or a
consequence of rather than a clear decline in the Nehruvian model, which transformed
the state into the primary source of secure jobs in postcolonial India. <p>

  On the whole, <I>Quest for Power </I>provides an important and convincing
explanation of the decline in the Congress- dominated political system. A short review
cannot adequately capture the nuanced empirical analysis of the central trends now
shaping Indian politics. This rich analysis makes the book worthwhile reading for
anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the increasingly complicated 
permutations of national politics in contemporary India.
