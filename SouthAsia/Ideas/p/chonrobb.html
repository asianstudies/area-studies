Peter Robb, <i>Ancient Rights and Future Comforts: Bihar, The Bengal
Tenancy Act of 1885, and British Rule in India</i> (London, Curzon
Press), xxviii + 378 pp.<p>

'Influence, in this country, goes with land, not with money; and it is
influence that we want to preserve' (p.231). So noted Denzil Ibbetson,
Secretary of the Revenue and Agriculture Department, at the turn of this
century. As with many of Ibbetson's views, this one was straightforward
and accurate. By the last half of the nineteenth century, it had become
obvious to government that in order to continue their influence, they
were going to have to overhaul, in dramatic fashion, the tenancy
regulations in the Bengal Presidency. The question before them, then,
was how to do so in a way that would secure them the greatest influence
and at the same time shore up the legitimacy of their rule. It is this
issue that Peter Robb addresses with admirable clarity and depth.<p>

<i>Ancient Rights and Future Comforts</i> follows a tradition that
originated with Eric Stokes' classic work, <i>The English Utilitarinas
and India</i> (Oxford, 1959). That work, and others that followed it,
provided an intellectual history of the monumental Permanent Settlement
of 1793, which set up <i>zamindars</i> as proprietors of the land. Robb
picks up this thread, and carries it over to the second-most important
event in the history of land tenure in colonial Bengal: The Bengal
Tenancy Act of 1885 (BTA). He writes an intellectual history of the Act
of which Stokes would have been proud.<p>

[<i>++ Page 298 	in SOUTH ASIA</i>]<p>

As with the earlier utilitarians, the administrators of the late
nineteenth century felt an obligation to justify any changes in land
tenure, basing them on a variety of issues. Of these, two were primary,
and it is these two that Robb deals with extensively: Should the BTA be
based on 'custom' or 'progress', and should the settlement be made with
<i>zamindars</i> or <i>raiyats</i> (cultivators)? These two issues
became entwined, and they provided the discourse around which the Act
developed.<p>

Within this debate, however, Robb notes two important caveats: The Act
was a response to the Permanent Settlement, which itself was based on a
false set of premises, and the Act reflected the growing power of the
state. As such, while the BTA had an enormous impact on agricultualists,
it did so in ways that were not necessarily anticipated.<p>

The first problem was the perception of 'custom'. The attempt to
'restore ... earlier practices' (p. 108) centered around the
interpretations of the purpose of the Permanent Settlement, and how that
act had changed pre-British land tenure: '[C]entral to the tenancy
debate was a closely-fought contest between pro-peasant radical
conservatives and pro-landlord conservative radicals' (p. 9). Both sides
attempted to claim history as their ally. This history, however, was
largely irrelevant; '[I]t was the perception of need [for real change]
that mattered' (p. 165).<p>

Given that the BTA was, to a large extent, based on false assumptions,
what in fact did it accomplish? Robb argues that in order to understand
its impact, we must look at continuities in Indian history rather than
disruptions. Particularly at the local level, while the BTA created new
subsets of tenants, '... the state was not really present, in the
maintenance of registers, to protect the weak. Rather it provided
machinery to record and entrench the success of the strong' (p. 277).

That the BTA tended to confirm the status of the powerful should not be
surprising; Robb emphasizes the crucial role politics played in the
formation of the Act. Publicity, job satisfaction, genuine concern about
rights in land, and legitimacy, all were factors employed in making and
remaking land tenure changes in Bengal (p. 370). Perhaps of most import,
however, was the impact of a convoluted mixture of 'custom' and
Eurocentrism: '... [T]he contribution of indigenous ideas was large and
independent, but remained, in regard to state policy, one of
establishing conditions upon which imported concepts had to work' (p.
332). In part because of this paradox, the Bengal Tenancy Act still has
social and political ramifications at the local level in north India
today.<p>

<i>Ancient Rights and Future Comforts</i> is a dense book. This is not a
criticism; it deals with a dense subject. As such, Robb deserves
congratulations for his ability to imbue the reader with a sense of the
purpose and results of the Bengal Tenacy Act that is not overwhelmed by
specifics and obscurities. This book deserves a welcomed place alongside
the earlier classic studies of agrarian and revenue law in colonial
India.
