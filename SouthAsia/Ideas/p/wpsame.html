<P>This essay explores the contours of the deep historiographical gulf
produced by postmodernism and deconstruction as this gulf appears in
south Asian historiography.<a name="R01"></a><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>
(1)</SUP></A> In particular it examines two recent works whose central
focus is the relationship of knowledge to power in British India.  Both
works under consideration look to Edward Said and Michel Foucault for
theoretical insights, yet their respective understandings of the way
knowledge sustains imperial power (and how power structures knowledge)
are fundamentally incompatible. They do not disagree that knowledge and
power are historically linked, but rather on the specific trajectories
of knowledge and power in the colonial Indian setting. Nevertheless,
theirs is a profound disagreement, not amenable to reconciliation in my
view. Rather than attempt to delineate a middle ground, I test the
assertion of fundamental difference between European and Indian
cognition that is present (but undeveloped) in one of the works and that
underpins postmodernist-deconstructionist scholarship on colonial India
generally. I do this by examining the suggestive relationship between
the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the English ambassador to his court in
1615, Sir Thomas Roe.

<P> One important result of the entry and, some would say, triumph of
postmodernism and deconstructionism in Indian historiography is the
dethroning of caste as an analytic concept. Long held to be the
fundamental structural dynamic of Indian society (and hence the key
marker of civilizational difference from the West), caste - and all that
it implied <a name="R02"></a><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> - is
increasingly understood as little more

<P>[++page 390 William Pinch]

<P>than the intellectual product of a Eurocentric imperial sociology of
knowledge, or "Orientalism" for short. Ron Inden asserted in 1990 that
"virtually all of the hegemonic accounts of India, beginning with Mill
and Hegel, have made caste into the central pillar of their constructs.
Caste, they have held, is the type of society characteristic of India,
the institution that distinguishes it from the other civilizations of
Asia as well as from the West."<a name="R03"></a><A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>
(3)</SUP></A> The European representation of caste, it was further
argued, was not restricted to European philosophical discourses but had
a measurable effect on Indian society itself. Nicholas Dirks thus
observed that "colonialism seems to have created much of what is now
accepted as Indian 'tradition,' including an autonomous caste structure
with the Brahman clearly and unambiguously at the head."<a
name="R04"></a><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> While most historians
would scarcely go this far in putting an imperial cart before the
hierarchical horse (and Dirks himself quickly retreats from that
ordering),<a name="R05"></a><A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> few
today would fail to acknowledge the intimate relationship between state
and status in understanding changing social relations, and theories of
social being, in India.

<P>The postmodernist dethroning of caste is not as revolutionary in
south Asian historiography as one might have thought. In large part this
is because much of the empirical and theoretical groundwork for
historicizing the concept of caste was done by social historians
themselves (with the help of anthropologists) working in the 1960' and
1970s, some of them working in these very pages.<a name="R06"></a><A
HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> But another and, for our purposes, more
important manifestation of the increased profile of postmodernism and
deconstructionism in south Asian historiography has been the rise to
prominence - some would say hegemonic dominance (especially in the U.S.)
- since the early 1980' of the "subaltern studies collective."<a
name="R07"></a><A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 391]

<P>The initial interpretive thrust of the subaltern approach was that
understandings of the recent south Asian past, particularly with respect
to the rise of colonialism and nationalism, were both the product and
propagator of "elitist" paradigms, whether British imperial or Indian
nationalist.  Indeed, not only were most if not all historical
narratives elitist, the very evidence upon which those narratives relied
was tainted by its proximity to, if not outright participation in,
networks of power. In the view of Ranajit Guha, the doyen of the
subaltern collective, a subaltern narrative free of elitism required
both a radically subversive rereading of the tainted evidence and a
politically combative historiographical posture.<a name="R08"></a><A
HREF="#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>

<P>The rise of the subaltern studies collective contributed to a
significant shift in historiographical debate on modern India. The focus
on subaltern resistances to the colonial-nationalist state called into
question a variety of historical narratives, particularly those of a
"Bengal Renaissance" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries and of nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. These narratives were increasingly perceived as overly
focused on the thin veneer of relatively benign Indian contact with
European ideas, individuals, and institutions, to the neglect of massive
processes of social, economic, and cultural immiseration below. A
subaltern history of national consciousness gradually emerged, within
and without the pages of <EM>Subaltern Studies</EM>, which positioned
itself against both colonialism and nationalism and focused on the ways
ordinary people - particularly low-level bureaucrats, peasants, tribals,
untouchables, and women - came to terms with uncompromising colonial
statism and an equally uncompromising Gandhian-Nehruvian nationalism.
<a name="R09"></a><A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Fundamental to
much subaltern historiography was the notion that there was not one
colonial India but two: one inhabited by aloof if not outright cruel
British officials abetted by a narrow Indian elite, the other inhabited
by Indian subjects struggling in mute silence with their varying degrees
of subjecthood, or subalternity. A "British India" existed only insofar
as comprador "<EM>babus</EM>" made the daily passage from the one India
to the other, and suffered the psychocultural traumas that went with
that passage.

<P>Relatively few attempts were made to challenge this new
historiography directly, especially on the ground of the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries - the period of maximum British power,
increasing Indian subjugation, and rising national consciousness. Some
would question the degree to which the subaltern was unable to speak,
others would argue that the subaltern approach is theoretically
ill-equipped to perceive the complexity and relative autonomy of

<P>[++page 392  WILLIAM R. PINCH]

<P>religious consciousness as an agent of meaningful social and
political change from below.  <a name="R10"></a><A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP>
(10)</SUP></A> However, a parallel historiography of British India had
begun to coalesce in the late 1970s that, though not geared as a
critique of the subaltern collective, would over time challenge its
historiographical bifocalism. This "early modern" school understood the
transition to British rule in India in terms of Indian social, economic,
and political processes that were well under way in the late seventeenth
century. In this view the British were drawn into subcontinental
dominance, if not in a fit of absent-mindedness, then as a result of an
Indian commercialization of politics.  <a name="R11"></a><A
HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> In short, it was argued that
successful trade in late Mughal (eighteenth-century) India depended on
access to political power, and political power was heavily dependent on
subcontinental mercantile and financial networks to make revenue
collection viable. In injecting themselves into politics, Company
traders were simply behaving according to the rules of the
eighteenth-century Indian political economy. This argument had two
important implications: first, that there was much social-historical
(and not simply symbolic and political-cultural) continuity between
Mughal and British India; and second, that the British should be treated
as a south Asian social group if we are to arrive at a more nuanced
understanding of the eighteenth century.  <a name="R12"></a><A
HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>

<P>These arguments were met with considerable rhetorical scorn, though
not with conclusively invalidating evidence, by the subaltern school.
The suggestion that the piecemeal conquest of India by the British was a
process set in motion by Indian forces was read as an attempt to
depoliticize colonialism, to suggest that "it never happened."  <a
name="R13"></a><A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Where is the room
in the "early modern" account, it was asked, for the military
superiority of British forces against ill-equipped Indian armies, not to
mention the callous and conniving manipulation of Indian ruling lineages
to serve the cynical imperialist designs of faceless
gentlemen-capitalists in London? The assertion that the British should
be understood as a south Asian social group struck some as particularly
offensive in light of the official and unofficial racism that marked the
consolidation of British power from the 1790s onward. The postcolonial
politics of postmodernism required that modernism be the unambiguous
product of colonial rule. For those in the subaltern fold,
discontinuities outweighed continuities and difference obliterated
similarity: the rise of the totalizing-yet-alienating state, the
disruption of a public sphere con-

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 393]

<P>necting rulers and ruled, and, most pointedly, the gradual
incorporation of marginal populations into an agrarian empire and the
increasing impoverishment of agrarian society -- all were deemed the
product of British rule.

<P>By the early 1990s, then, the new fault lines were becoming clear.
The subaltern approach emphasized (and sometimes claimed to speak on
behalf of) a cultural history from below of political disruption enacted
from above - often emphasizing the latter to the relative neglect of the
former. The centrality of colonial and nationalist politics meant that
subaltern histories rarely penetrated back in time before 1757.  <a
name="R14"></a><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The "early modern"
approach emphasized a history of social, economic, and cultural
continuities, with a focus on the common interests and actions of
Britons and Indians in the joint production of British India despite
obvious political inequalities between Britons and Indians. For this a
social-historical understanding of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was deemed crucial for any consideration of the nineteenth
century.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">II

<P>In 1996 the two schools met on roughly the same historical turf, over
the issue of imperial knowledge of India from about the mid-eighteenth
to the late nineteenth century - in other words during the emergence and
consolidation of British rule. A close examination of the works - Cohn's
<EM>Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge</EM> and Bayly's <EM>Empire
and Information</EM> - reveals in greater detail the contours of the
historiographical rift produced by postmodernism and deconstruction.

<P>Both authors are well known to students of south Asian history. Cohn,
an American and the senior of the two scholars, was trained as an
anthropologist in the 1950s and quickly established himself in the
following decade as one of the prominent voices in bringing history and
anthropology into productive dialogue.<a name="R15"></a><A
HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> His initial work was focused on
social change under colonial rule, particularly among the Chamars of the
Banaras region. The greater his penetration into Indian social arenas of
change the more he felt a need to disentangle the British colonial
sources that tended to structure modern historical understanding. He
turned his attention to anthropological-historical study of the Indian
Civil Service, and out of this grew his larger concern with the
political discourses of British knowledge about India itself. Bayly, a
British scholar, was trained in the 1960s and 1970s as a historian and
did his early work on the social history of nationalism in the north
Indian town of Allahabad. This led to an examination of north Indian
urban history prior to the rise of nationalism, resulting in his major
study of the transition to colonial rule, <EM>Rulers, Townsmen and
Bazaars: North Indian Society in the Age of British Expansion,
1770-1870</EM> (Cambridge, Eng.,


<P>[++page 394  WILLIAM R. PINCH]


<P>1983). Since then his attentions have been divided between the social
and cultural history of the British empire worldwide and more focused
considerations of specific themes in early modern south Asian history.


<P>Cohn describes in <EM>Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge</EM> how
ways of knowing were deployed by the British in colonial India to
further the imperializing project. Each of his chapters, save for the
introduction, is a stand-alone piece that follows a representational
field from its pre- or early-colonial beginnings to its high colonial
peak. The final chapter, on the political meanings of cloth and
clothing, ends with Indian nationalist reactions to British
symbolizations and lends the work a sense of closure if not conclusion.
The arguments are familiar, in part because the volume serves as a venue
to bring together Cohn's articles since the late 1980s for the
convenience of a wide readership, but mostly because the themes are
prominent ones in "post-Orientalist" scholarship since the late 1970s.<a
name="R16"></a><A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Thus chapter one on
language ("The Command of Language and the Language of Command"), which
examines the shift from Persian to Urdu/Hindustani as the administrative
language of the nineteenth century, shares with Ranajit Guha a concern
with linguistic strategies of displacement, distancing, subordination,
and control as fundaments of British imperial domination.<a
name="R17"></a><A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The second chapter,
on the British manipulation of Indian legal codes to satisfy a British
need for manageable structures of rule and revenue extraction,
intersects with (and provides a historical context for) Lata Mani's work
on the British use of sati (suttee) as an occasion to "Anglicize" Indian
tradition.<a name="R18"></a><A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The
third chapter, on the transformation of Indian objects into artifacts,
antiquities, and art as a process that reflected a British desire to
symbolize imperial conquest in controlled spaces in Britain itself (what
might be called a trophy-case pathology), shares with Richard Davis an
interest in the biography of art objects, most famously Tipu Sultan's
tiger.<a name="R19"></a><A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Finally,
in the last chapter Cohn examines the politics of clothing in a series
of arguments that presaged work on the same subject by Emma Tarlo;<a
name="R20"></a><A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> he argues that the
British not only undermined Indian symbolic codes associated with
clothing and adornment and replaced them with their own, simpler
hierarchy of meanings, but that these discursive practices were
challenged by Indian nationalist innovations in dress.

<P>Whereas Cohn sees invented knowledge schemes as emblematic of the
colonizing mission in India, Bayly focuses on the importance of received
knowledge


<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 395]


<P>in the making of empire. He argues, first, that the British relied
heavily upon late Mughal techniques of information collection and
dissemination in their rise to subcontinental dominance - indeed, that
the depth and breadth of those techniques determined to a remarkable
degree the geographical boundaries and functional characteristics of the
British empire in India by 1850.  (One can see here a possible parallel
to his earlier argument, from <EM>Rulers, Townsmen and Bazaars</EM>,
that an eighteenth-century "commercialization of politics" dictated the
process whereby the British grasped the reins of subcontinental power.
Crucial to the present work is an informational market that pervades and
structures the commerce in politics from the earlier work.<a
name="R21"></a><A HREF="#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>) Bayly then turns
to a wide-ranging discussion of how the fluid and open, indeed
transactional, "information order" of the eighteenth century was
subverted by British intelligence manipulation and hoarding. Gradually
over the course of the early nineteenth century, older techniques and
networks gave way to new, more scientific modes of information
gathering, the inadequacies of which resulted in the British failure to
detect the strength of anticolonial sentiment among sepoy troops,
landlords, and princes leading up to the Mutiny-Rebellion of 1857. For
Bayly, then, while the emerging colonizing discourses of the nineteenth
century may well have reflected a British desire to control and
inferiorize India, the historical significance of those discourses was
that they themselves contained inferior information from the perspective
of an imperial intelligence-gathering system. More simply, by
misrepresenting Indian society they contributed to "information panics"
and weakened the imperial state.<a name="R22"></a><A HREF="#N_22_"><SUP>
(22)</SUP></A>


<P>Because they are concerned with different levels of knowledge
production in the colonial setting, the arguments of Cohn and Bayly may
not appear to stand in direct opposition to each other. If we penetrate
more deeply, however, we begin to perceive the ways in which each author
is uneasy with the other's arguments -- ways that reflect the south
Asian historiographical divide described earlier. Cohn sees the colonial
state as the main author of politics and political meaning, if not the
sole agent of Indian social and economic change;<a name="R23"></a><A
HREF="#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> consequently he thinks the place to
look to understand the history of British India is the global colonial
arena itself, and especially the culture of that arena and the way it
generated knowledge. Thus knowledge of languages, the "first step" in
the translation-conquest of India, enabled "the British to classify,
categorize, and bound the vast social world that was India so that it
could be controlled. These imperatives, elements in the larger colonial
project, shaped the `investigative modalities' devised by the British to
collect the facts."<a name="R24"></a><A HREF="#N_24_"><SUP>
(24)</SUP></A> These British "investigative modalities" -


<P>[++page 396  WILLIAM R. PINCH]


<P>historiographic, observational/travel, survey, enumerative,
museological, and surveillance - therefore occupy center stage in Cohn's
analytical framework.


<P>Bayly, by contrast, sees local processes of social, political, and
economic change as the primary forces in south Asian history. Indian
arenas are therefore crucial to the production of vital political
information - and whole vocabularies and languages with which to
understand that information. He argues as well for the persistence of
those arenas (and the social groups that inhabit them) through the
nineteenth and into the twentieth century despite serious atrophy due to
imperial neglect. Though he does not use the term, Bayly makes it clear
that Hindu and Muslim polities had developed their own
utilitarian-bureaucratic "investigative modalities" well prior to the
seventeenth century. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, four
overlapping Indo-Islamic informational "idioms" had emerged: a "purely
empirical idiom" (formal knowledge of geography, resources, statistics);
"spiritual anthropology" (that ranged from accounts of religious sects
to catalogues of folkloric genres); "moral ecology" (embodied in a
political-cultural fascination with "marvels"); and "genealogy"
(concerned with racial, familial, religious, and other pedigrees). These
"informational idioms" may have reflected at times a more "holistic" or
"humoral" understanding than later European "investigative modalities,"
but they were no less "essentializing" and "othering" - indeed, Bayly
suggests that the European essentializings of "the Orient" depended to a
large extent on the substance of these earlier representations.<a
name="R25"></a><A HREF="#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>

<P>Bayly urges his readers to examine the local pragmatics of
knowledge-production and consumption by Indians and Britons, and
cautions repeatedly against the view that the British were able "to
`construct' Indian society independently of the agency of its social
formations and knowledge communities ."<a name="R26"></a><A
HREF="#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> "Our understanding of 'colonial
discourse'," he argues,


<P>must reflect the pervasiveness of Indian agency, of the Indian
intellectual challenge, and of Indian cultural vitality. Curiously, the
introduction of the "knowledge is power" theme of Francis Bacon and
Michel Foucault into Indian historiography, alongside the behaviourist
concept of "hybridisation," has sometimes served to marginalise Indians
and their knowledge as thoroughly as the most hidebound colonial
administrative history ever did.<a name="R27"></a><A HREF="#N_27_"><SUP>
(27)</SUP></A>


<P>We might take this to be a critique of Edward Said, but Bayly is
careful to point out that his own arguments concerning "orientalized"
knowledge are "perfectly compatible with Said's position" in
Orientalism. Rather, the critique is leveled at Said's "followers"
working on India, Cohn (and Inden and Dirks) prominent among them.<a
name="R28"></a><A HREF="#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Another way of
stating this is that Cohn uses Foucault in a


<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE +++page 397]


<P>manner in keeping with the dominant mode of subaltern historiography,
to examine state power through its authorship of colonial discourses
(and, as with many such narratives, the subaltern is only seen through a
glass darkly<a name="R29"></a><A HREF="#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>).
Bayly, by contrast, uses Foucault in a subversive way (though perhaps
more in keeping with Foucault himself), to argue that "the emergence of
systems of knowledge could equally well reflect the weaknesses of power
and legitimacy, or situations of intense social competition."<a
name="R30"></a><A HREF="#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>


<P>Upon deeper inspection, then, Cohn's and Bayly's accounts of the
British empire in India turn out to be profoundly incompatible: deep
disagreement about the relationship between power and knowledge produces
markedly divergent subjective foci, which themselves produce
noncontiguous narratives about British India. It might seem that the
noncontiguity of the narratives means that they could be blended into
one account, thus: the rise of the British empire in the Indian
subcontinent depended on the workings of Indian knowledge communities;
the increasing political purchase of colonial discourses unconnected to
those Indian knowledge communities, though it reflected British imperial
self-confidence, also weakened British imperial power. But this blended
narrative does not (and cannot) do justice to either Cohn's point of
departure or his point of closure. Cohn's larger agenda, his point of
closure, is to offer a critique of post-colonial investigative
modalities - or more precisely, the ways in which the modernist (late
and post-imperial) social sciences, particularly history, anthropology,
and political science, have propagated an oppressive evolutionary
understanding of the non-West inherited from the high-colonial past.<a
name="R31"></a><A HREF="#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> His point of
departure is that Europeans and Indians possessed fundamentally
different ways of perceiving and knowing the world around them prior to
the rise of colonial rule, despite their cohabitation of the same
physical space, and that British colonial rule enabled the European
episteme to rule the day. Without this narrative framing, Cohn's history
would simply be about ironic epiphenomena - a description of British
conversations about power wholly unconnected to Indian
cultural-historical reality. With the proper framing, Cohn's history has
cultural-historical weight as a history of both imperial Britain and
subject India.

<P>Thus while Cohn's and Bayly's works share superficial similarities,
there is profound disagreement. Happily, this fact is captured by the
artwork chosen by the authors to adorn the covers of their respective
books: Bayly's image is Charles Doyley's "An European gentleman and his
moonshee or native professor of languages," from <EM>The European in
India</EM> (London, 1813); Cohn's is F. G. Atkinson's "Our Magistrate,"
from <EM>"Curry and Rice" on Forty Plates</EM> (London, 1859). Both
works are candid portrayals by Britons of British officials interact-

<P>[++page 398  WILLIAM R. PINCH]

<P>ing with Indians, but there the similarities end. Doyley's image
(used by Bayly) pictures two men seated at a writing table in a library,
one a European practicing his Persian script, the other an Indian (the
"moonshi" or language instructor) reading from a Persian or Urdu text as
if in dictation. In the background on a reading stand is a book by John
Gilchrist, the well-known linguist and author of <EM>A Grammar of the
Hindustani Language</EM> (Menston, England, 1796).  Atkinson's image
(used by Cohn) depicts a British magistrate on horseback lecturing
suppliant though sturdy peasants while on "tour" through the
countryside. Slightly in the background to the right stands a
well-dressed Indian, also deferential to the Briton; his sword and
weight would mark him out as the local landlord. The magistrate appears
to be resolving a dispute as if by cajoling and decree. Knowledge and
power are the themes of both artistic representations, but in the former
knowledge travels in one direction while power travels in the other (one
might even suggest that the power is destabilized as a result), while in
the latter the trajectories of knowledge and power both emanate from the
Briton on horseback.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">III

<P>Which image captures better, or more fully, the British in India?
Perhaps no single image can do full justice to the totality of the
imperial, colonial experience - to both the pleasures of Orientalist
learning and the pain of colonial violence. But both images point to a
dimension of British-Indian history that is underdeveloped in each work,
namely, the dimension of personal contact and mutual understanding (or
misunderstanding) between Britons and Indians, Cohn touches on this
question with his assertion that seventeenth-century Europeans and
Indians perceived the world in fundamentally different ways. But the
assertion is left dangling and, as we shall see, is contradicted by his
later discussion. The question of essential cultural difference between
precolonial India and Europe is not territory into which Bayly is
willing to make a detailed foray. In part, this is because the object of
his study is the <EM>social</EM> history of Indian knowledge
communities, in Part because he tends to disaggregate "India" (and
"Europe") into their component parts before generalizing broadly (a
lesson taught three decades ago by Cohn himself).<a name="R32"></a><A
HREF="#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> Bayly does suggest, however, that
"India was not qualitatively different from other societies with
emergent public spheres."<a name="R33"></a><A HREF="#N_33_"><SUP>
(33)</SUP></A> If nothing else, this would indicate some serious unease
with Cohn's assertion of fundamental

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 399]

<P>difference. The assertion of difference - and its corollary,
discontinuity-is one that underpins much postmodernist scholarship in
anthropology and history; hence it is worth examining in greater detail
here.

<P>According to Cohn, "Europeans of the seventeenth century lived in a
world of signs and correspondences, whereas Indians lived in a world of
substances .... The British in seventeenth-century India operated on the
idea that everything and everyone had a 'price.' . . .  They never
seemed to realize that certain kinds of cloth and clothes, jewels, arms,
and animals had values that were not established in terms of a
market-determined price, but were objects in a culturally constructed
system by which authority and social relations were literally
constituted and transmitted." By contrast, "Hindus and Muslims operated
with an unbounded substantive theory of objects and persons."<a
name="R34"></a><A HREF="#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> This contrast has a
seductive appeal for historians of India because it draws upon a
well-known if at the time controversially anti-British argument by the
early twentieth-century theologian-historian F. W. Buckler about Mughal
imperial symbolism and authority.<a name="R35"></a><A
HREF="#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> It is also reminiscent of another
anthropologist-historian's compelling account of a fatal cultural

According to Cohn, Roe "read the political world in which he found
himself in terms of his own systems of meanings," meanings that did not
mesh with Mughal political ideology and practice. The latter were
grounded in "a widespread and older theory of kingship, found in Central
Asia, Persia, and India, in which 'the king stands for a system of rule
of which he is the incarnation, incorporating into his own body by means
of symbolic acts, the person of those who share his rule.'"<a
name="R37"></a><A HREF="#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> The
misunderstandings that ensued resulted for Roe in "a thousand
indignities" - being forced to pay endless bribes, being unable to
communicate effectively with the Mughal emperor and his subordinates,
and being cast into one embarrassing social and political situation
after another.<a name="R38"></a><A HREF="#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>
The literary scholar Kate Teltscher has expanded on this theme to argue
that "Roe reads the signs of an Eastern court through the conventions of
English theatrical representation. Equipped with the wrong cultural
script, Roe turns a compliment into an insult."<a name="R39"></a><A
HREF="#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>


<P>Roe is emblematic, for Cohn, of "the [European] idea that everything
and everyone had a 'price.'" But was Roe really such a bumbling rube, a
ruthless capitalist ontologically overwhelmed by material value, unable
to see past his nose for vulgar trade, and paralyzed by an inability to
imbibe courtly corporeal ritual and its symbols of substance? The image
does not sit well with Philip Mason's description of Roe as "a
gentleman, a courtier, a former Esquire to the Body of the Queen, a
friend of Prince Henry and his sister Elizabeth of Bohemia."<a
name="R40"></a><A HREF="#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> Admittedly, Mason
was of an earlier generation of historians of British India, given to
moments of nostalgic celebration when describing <EM>The Men Who Ruled
India</EM>. But the contrast makes clear that we need a fuller picture
of Roe, and of the Mughal court, if we are to test the assertion of
difference between Mughal India and Elizabethan-Jacobean England - and
between India and Europe generally.

<P>Roe was from a commercial family of Kent that had risen in the world
in the sixteenth century. He was introduced to the Elizabethan court at
a fairly young age and served the elderly queen as a personal attendant.
His star continued to rise under James I: he was knighted in 1603 and
developed an extremely close friendship with the king's young children,
Henry and Elizabeth, and with Sir Walter Raleigh. These friendships,
particularly with Elizabeth and Henry, would loom large in the
trajectories of his life. In short, we might say Roe was

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 401]

<P>immersed in the late sixteenth-, early seventeenth-century English
court. How did he perceive this court, his knighthood, his royal
connections? No doubt they all advanced his career, but at the same time
they shaped his social and emotional world. An example is his devotion
to the princess Elizabeth, whose own fortunes were to plummet following
her marriage to the ill-fated Frederick V of Bohemia in 1613. She would
send Roe portraits of herself and her husband, would tease Roe about his
weight, and would confide in him "all the forlorn hopes and schemes by
which she hoped to bring about her family's restoration." For his part,
Roe would profess to "have not one dropp of blood in my hart which I
will not shed for you," even though she had little if anything to offer
him in the way of material advancement.<a name="R41"></a><A
HREF="#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>

<P>It is true that Roe was immediately struck by the prominent role that
gift-giving and receiving played in gaining access to the Mughal
emperor's circle. But he quickly perceived the significance of those
gifts, not as objects with which to buy imperial favor, but as
extensions of the emperor's person on the one hand and as expressions of
the subordinate's own commitment to and participation in the emperor's
aura of power on the other. Indeed, Cohn himself notes that "Roe and his
small party . . . began to realize that the clothes worn - and
particularly the use of cloth and clothes as prestations in the Mughal's
court - had meaning far beyond any `practical use."' This understanding
was the basis of Roe's misgivings about gift exchange, because, as Cohn
infers, it "was the means by which authoritative relations were
established and would, in the eyes of the Indians, make Roe into a
subordinate or companion of the Mughals."<a name="R42"></a><A
HREF="#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> But not only in the eyes of Indians:
Roe had eyes too, and he himself inhabited a ritual-political world. He
was invested already, ritually and emotionally, in the English court and
its European connections, primarily by way of his early service in
attendance on Queen Elizabeth, his knighthood at the hands of James I,
and especially his attachment to the younger Elizabeth, Queen of
Bohemia.  Enmeshing himself in the ritual web of the Mughal court would
have meant, for Roe, compromising or at the very least blunting those
earlier meanings.

<P>Roe arrived at the Mughal court, then at Ajmere, in late December
1615. He immediately obtained from Jahangir "leave to vse the Customes
of my Country, which was freely granted:" Roe was pleased with his first
meeting, and later remarked that the emperor "dismissed me with more
fauour and outward grace. . . then euer was showed to any Ambassador,
eyther of the Turke or Persian, or other whatsoever. "<a
name="R43"></a><A HREF="#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> Despite his
misgivings, Roe eventually allowed himself to


<P>[++page 402  WILLIAM R. PINCH]


<P>be drawn into Jahangir's intimate courtly circle. But he did so, and
Jahangir allowed him to do so, in a way that reveals both the fluidity
and convergences of culture on both sides:


<P>I went to visitt the King, who, as soone as I came in, called to his
woemen and reached out a picture of him selfe sett in gould hanging at a
wire gould Chaine, with one pendant foule pearle, which hee deliuered to
Asaph chan [Asaf Khan, brother-in-law to Jahangir], warning him not to
demand any reuerence of mee other then such as I would willingly giue,
it being the Custome, when soever hee bestowes any thing, the receiuer
kneeles downe and putts his head to the ground (which hath been exacted
of the Embassadores of Persia). So Asaph Chan came to mee, and I offered
to take it in my hand; but hee made signe to putt of my hatt, and then
putt it about my neck, leading me right before the king.<a
name="R44"></a><A HREF="#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>


<P>This event, a modified initiation of Roe into the "cult" of the
emperor - a cult invented by the emperor Akbar, Jahangir's father, in
the late sixteenth century - occurred on August 17, 1616. As with his
knighthood, we cannot be certain how Roe experienced this ritual moment.
One could easily read the event through Cohn's lenses, however, since
Roe would later reflect on the price of the pendant: "This guift was not
woorth in all 30 <EM>li</EM>." At the same time, he was aware of the
honor bestowed upon him, remarking that "it was five tymes as good as
any hee giues in that kynd, and held for an especiall fauour, for that
all the great men that weare the kings Image (which none may doe but to
whom it is giuen) receiue noe other than a meddall of gould as bigg as
sixpence, with a little chayne of 4 inches to fasten it on their heads,
which at their owne Chardg some sett with stones and garnishe with
pendant Pearles."<a name="R45"></a><A HREF="#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A>


<P>Honor and money are at play in Roe's initiation, certainly. Yet there
is more here than meets the eye. To fully understand the layered
meanings of the event, we must broaden our range of vision. A month
earlier, Jahangir had engaged Roe (through his newly court-appointed
Jesuit interpreter) in an extensive discussion of European and Indian
painting. Roe recognized that Jahangir was an avid connoisseur,
immensely proud of his own painters' abilities yet impressed by European
techniques. He remarked in his journal that "I neuer recieued so much
grace and fauour from the King as at this tyme, which all men tooke
notice off, and accordingly altered their fasions toward me."<a
name="R46"></a><A HREF="#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Desperate to gain
favor with the emperor so as to bring to fruition his diplomatic
mission, Roe conspired with Asaf Khan (who, together with his sister Nur
Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was the main power behind the throne) to offer
as a present to the emperor a small portrait pendant of intricate
workmanship that Roe had brought with him from England. Asaf Khan showed
it to Jahangir who, delighted, called for his chief artist to ask his
opinion of its workmanship. The artist claimed to be able to match it,
whereupon the emperor and a skeptical Roe entered into a friendly wager.
Three weeks later, Roe was shown six pendants and asked to pick the
original. He was able to do so, but only after considerable difficulty.
They were


<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 403]


<P>"so like I was by candle-light troubled to discerne which was which;
l confesse beyond all expectation; yet I skewed myne owne and the
differences, which were in ante apparent, but not to be judged by a
Common eye." Jahangir was so pleased with Roe's appreciation of the
skill of his artist that he allowed the ambassador to pick one of the
copies for his own to take back to England, as proof that "wee are not
soe vnskillfull as you esteeme vs." By way of explanation, Roe showed
Jahangir a small portrait he had purchased of the emperor, on which he
had based his mistakenly low opinion of Indian painting. Incredulous,
Jahangir chided Roe for buying such things rather than asking for them
directly. After expressing his reluctance ("I held it not Ciuilite to
trouble him in such trifles") Roe finally requested a portrait for
himself.<a name="R47"></a><A HREF="#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> This was
on August 7, 1616; Roe was initiated into Jahangir's circle ten days
later.


<P>There is a great deal going on in these exchanges, both at the level
of personal self-interest and aesthetic sensibility. What must not be
lost sight of, however we read the politics of Roe's mission, is the
fact that the ambassador and the emperor were measuring each other using
their own languages of art appreciation in ways they could not in either
of their spoken languages.<a name="R48"></a><A HREF="#N_48_"><SUP>
(48)</SUP></A> Jahangir was as puzzled by the Englishman's professed
interest in lowly matters of trade as he was fascinated by the unusual
ritual and material culture he brought to the court. For his part, Roe
was anxious to gain access to the emperor and frustrated by the control
Asaf Khan and Nur Jahan seemed to exercise over him. In the end, as
always, it is hard to know Roe's thoughts on all this, and harder still
to know Jahangir's (who does not even mention Roe in his memoirs, and
barely mentions the English). But a September 2nd encounter with the
emperor would indicate the extent to which Roe's emotional world had
spilled over into Jahangir's.<a name="R49"></a><A HREF="#N_49_"><SUP>
(49)</SUP></A> It was the emperor's birthday, when he was weighed
against a variety of jewels, grains, butter, fruit, and the like. Due to
what was probably an orchestrated logistical mishap at the hands of Asaf
Khan, who was apprehensive at Roe's increasing favor in the eyes of
Jahangir, Roe missed much of the spectacle.  Later in the evening
Jahangir sent for Roe, who was in bed, to ask after a painting in Roe's

<P>[++page 404  WILLIAM R. PINCH]

<P>possession "which I had not showed him, desiering mee to Come to him
and bring yt, and if I would not giue it him, yet that hee might see yt
and take Coppyes for his wiues." Roe rose immediately and brought two
pictures. Jahangir, jewel bedecked and his birthday celebration in full
swing, "seemed astonished at one of them; and demanded whose it was. I
answered a frend of myne that was dead." Jahangir asked if Roe would
give it to him as a gift, at which Roe expressed some reluctance,
confessing that "I esteemed it more then any thing I possessed, because
it was the Image of one that I loued dearly and Could neuer recouer."
After Jahangir assured him that he too loved the picture and "would
better esteeme of it then the richest Iewell in his house," Roe relented
and answered that "I was not soe in loue with anything that I would
refuse to Content his Maiestie: I was extreame glad to doe him seruice,
and if I could giue him a better demonstration of my affections, which
was my hart to doe him seruice, I was ready to present it to him."
Pressed as to whether the woman in the portrait really existed, Roe
"assuered him ther did one liue that this did resemble in all things but
perfection, and was now dead." Moved, Jahangir replied that "hee would
not take yt: that hee loued mee the better for louing the remembrance of
my frende."  He would simply have copies made for his wives, and then
personally return it.<a name="R50"></a><A HREF="#N_50_"><SUP>
(50)</SUP></A>

<P>This preliminary foray into the courtly worlds of Thomas Roe suggests
that an early seventeenth-century European lived in a "world of
substances" as well as "signs and correspondences," and not simply the
latter to the complete exclusion of the former. This should not be taken
to mean that European and Indian understandings were identical. The
Mughal darbar and Elizabethan-Jacobean court were differently conceived
in many obvious and subtle ways-certainly in terms of their ritual
styles and the objects used to convey political authority and power, not
to mention their traditions of statecraft. But these were primarily
differences of detail, not of substance. The differences were
translatable. Most importantly, both courts were all too familiar with
the "cult" of the monarch, and the way that cult served to channel the
energy of courtly rivalries into the symbolic body of the sovereign, an
act of corporeal channeling that had the effect of drawing on religious
imagery and threatening religious orthodoxy in one stroke.<a
name="R51"></a><A HREF="#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> The phras-

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 405]

<P>es "Virgin Queen" and "<EM>Allah-u Akbar</EM>" (connoting both the
greatness of God and the divinity of Akbar) reverberated well into the
seventeenth century, even if the courtly cults surrounding them took on
new meanings and symbols.

<p><a name="sect4"></a>Back <a href="#top">to the top</a>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">IV

<P>The assertion that seventeenth-century Europeans and Indians
inhabited separate cognitive universes is, in a way, a projection back
in time of the historiographical bifocalism of the subaltern studies
collective. Ironically, it can have an unintended exculpatory effect,
insofar as it affords an understanding of imperialism on the grounds of
a failure to communicate. As it happens, such cognitive distancing is
not new. It has came into vogue in the historiography of colonial India
at different times and for glaringly political reasons, but with a
curious snowballing effect. Originally it served to allay imperial
anxieties about British venality in the rise to power by encouraging
nineteenth-century histories of one-sided British military conquest
rather than joint British-Indian political subterfuge.<a
name="R52"></a><A HREF="#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> After the turn of
the century it enabled Indian nationalist imaginings of a monolithic
evil empire against which a quasi-spiritual civilizational battle could
be waged. It was brought to bear by F. W. Buckler in the 1920s in a
critical analysis of the legality of British ritual behavior in the
Mughal court just prior to the Mutiny-Rebellion of 1857.<a
name="R53"></a><A HREF="#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> More recently, if
we accept Aijaz Ahmad's trenchant critique of theoretical developments
in the postcolonial world, cultural difference is used to shore up a
"Third-Worldist" literary-political separatism.<a name="R54"></a><A
HREF="#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>

<P>Theoretical assertions of difference have been made, then, in a
stunning variety of charged political contexts. However we handle our
own political dispositions in our historical research and writing,<a
name="R55"></a><A HREF="#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> the
presentist-political context of analytical assertions of difference must
be emphasized.  Jahangir and Roe demonstrate that cultural difference,
though real, should not be essentialized, or endowed with explanatory
depth <EM>sui generis</EM>. Significant about the interaction between
Roe and Jahangir is the degree to which the cognitive world of each
dissolved into that of the other. The ontological isolation of Europeans
and Indians (and its methodological consequences) would deprive us of
this observation, with all its necessary nuance and complexity; it robs
the text of context, result-

<P>[++page 406  WILLIAM R. PINCH]


<P>ing in an ironic "othering" of the subject, whether British or
Indian.<a name="R56"></a><A HREF="#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> An
analytical assumption of difference only serves to embed difference in
theory, which in turn reifies difference in method and argument. A total
history of the British in India must include Britons interacting
materially, biologically, socially, and emotionally with Indians (and
occupying the same cognitive world as Indians), and at the same time
enacting technologies of violence on the bodies and minds of Indians.
This may seem to reflect a tropological desire for narrative irony - if
not tragedy - not to mention a post-postmodernist desire to rehabilitate
those Orientalists hard-done-by in recent debates over knowledge and
power,<a name="R57"></a><A HREF="#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A> but in
fact it satisfies a philosophical (and commonsensical) mandate for
historical precision.

<P>There are important lessons here for the history of south Asia more
generally, not to mention the global history of cultural contact. Take
the history of religion, currently the most pressing historiographical
dilemma facing the Indian body politic. To understand the social history
of Islam and Hinduism (and even Christianity) in the subcontinent we
must focus our attentions not on prominent <EM>ex post facto</EM>
assertions of Muslim distinctiveness from Hindus (and vice versa), but
on the many cultural convergences that have occurred in practice within
a variety of social arenas - whether courtly, domestic, military,
literary, artistic, architectural, commercial, informational, even
monastic and religious.<a name="R58"></a><A HREF="#N_58_"><SUP>
(58)</SUP></A> In short, we must understand them as part of the same
history, not two (or three) separate histories connected only by
violence and trauma - as religio-political demagogues in the present
would have it. More broadly, as Bruce Trigger has noted, the obvious and
sometimes fatal cultural dissonances of early contact between peoples
should not obscure longer processes of "cognitive reorganization" that
shape meaning on the overlapping margins of cultures.<a
name="R59"></a><A HREF="#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> Arguments over
essential difference and essential sameness, relativism and
universalism, should give way to historical discussions of how sameness
<EM>and</EM> difference produce global cultural interaction.

<P>[SAME DIFFERENCE IN INDIA AND EUROPE ++page 407]

<P>Roe and Jahangir seem to have understood each other well, despite and
because of their difficulties in and obvious failures of communication.
Was Roe typical of Europeans, let alone Britons, in India? And was
Jahangir typical of Indians? Roe was an aristocrat, schooled in the
universal language of the court. He may have been typical of a class,
but it was a very small class.  Jahangir was even more unusual. He was
an emperor, and thus unlike any person in India. In his own estimation,
"No one is a relation to a king" - a lament uttered in 1605 at the
outset of his reign while ordering the pursuit unto possible death of
his own son Khusrau, not unlike Queen Elizabeth's despondent observation
at the end of her reign in 1600 that "Affection is false."<a
name="R60"></a><A HREF="#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> Though Jahangir
(and Elizabeth) and Roe were not themselves typical of Indians and
Europeans, it may be argued that one feature of their relationship was
emblematic of all human relationships.  Their initial deep
incomprehension about the other's cognitive world impelled each to seek
a language in which to achieve a mutual understanding. Their
incomprehension was grounded in geo-cultural distance and deepened by
contrasting political objectives; their arrival at mutual understanding
was the outgrowth of proximity, fueled by basic human curiosity, and
achieved by means of fortuitous cultural convergences. The tension in
their relationship was not simply a function of one party being European
and the other Indian. It was a productive tension that animated, and
animates still, all social relations.<a name="R61"></a><A
HREF="#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A> This fact must be captured in any
historical theory that seeks to understand cultural contact and its
political consequences.<a name="R62"></a><A HREF="#N_62_"><SUP>

The discussion of "orientalising" (150) concerns the production and
dislocation of knowledge produced in and for Tipu Sultan's Mysore: "The
information and the texts were not in any sense false; they were
generated locally and not from a colonial literary matrix. It was the
loss of context which occurred as they were appropriated by Calcutta and
Haileybury and then returned, abstracted, to the subcontinent, which
constituted the 'orientalising'."  <a href="#R28">Back</a>

sufficient merely to add up in an aggregate fashion the characteristics
of various social categories, e.g., `the western educated,' 'the
Bhadralog,' `the displaced landlords,' or `the social reformers,' and
assume that there has been a uniform process by which such groups or
categories in the society have been formed and that this process can be
inferred from a few characteristics of groups which can then be
correlated with their social, economic and political behaviour." This

to a word, a phrase, or an object, which could be determined and
translated, at best with a synonym that had a direct referent to
something in what the English thought of as a `natural' world.
Everything had a more or less specific referent for the English.  With
the Indians, meaning was not necessarily construed in the same fashion.
The effect and affect of hearing a Brahman chant in Sanskrit at a
sacrifice did not entail meaning in the European sense; it was to have
one's substance literally affected by the sound. When a Mughal ruler
issued a farman or a parvana, it was more than an order or an
entitlement .... Rather, they were a sharing in the authority and
substance of the originator." The general argument stems from the early
twentieth-century work of F. W. Buckler. See also 55-56, 114.  <a
href="#R34">Back</a>

<P><A NAME="N_35_">35. </A> Drawing on a novel theory of Indo-Persian
ritual incorporation, Buckler argued that East India Company officials
illegally asserted symbolic independence from the Mughal emperor in the
1840s, and thereby were really to blame for the Mutiny-Rebellion of
1857. Buckler, "The Political Theory of the Indian Mutiny of 1857,"

Borofsky, "Forum on Theory in Anthropology: Cook, Lono, Obeyesekere, and
Sahlins," <EM>Current Anthropology</EM> 38 (1997), 255-282. The
differences, of course, abound. Whereas Cook and his crew represented
the first European contact with the Hawaiians, Europeans had been
arriving on Indian shores for over two centuries by the time Roe
appeared on the scene. More fundamentally, Hawaii and Europe are
separated by two oceans and a continent. India and Europe are part of
the same landmass, and indirect contact between the two is as old as
history itself. As Sahlins notes repeatedly in<EM> How Natives Think:
About Captain Cook, For Example</EM> (Chicago, 1995), south Asian (and
particularly Sri Lankan) responses to Europeans after 1498 have little
if any resemblance to or relevance for European-Hawaiian contact in the
late eighteenth century.  <a href="#R36">Back</a>

As will become clear, l find these characterizations to be overstated
and unable to stand up to the evidence of Roe's own journal account.
Certainly Roe noted the theatrical quality of Mughal courtly culture -
after all, the Mughal emperors spent much of the year on the move,
living in tent cities - and he was put off by some of the rituals of
abasement to the emperor. But it is incorrect to conclude on the basis
of this that his "whole conception of the Mughal court is shot through
with a sense of unreality" (20), and that he denigrates the Mughal court
so as to reinforce "a sense of European superiority" (22).  <a

<P><A NAME="N_48_">48. </A> This argument can be expanded to suggest
that cultural exchange through portrait painting had framed Roe's entire
experience of the ritual spectacle of the Mughal court. For example, to
celebrate the nauroz (new year's) festival in March of 1616 (soon after
Roe's arrival at Ajmere), Jahangir had arranged for the wall decorations
near the throne to include portraits of James I, Queen Anna, Sir Thomas
Smythe (then Governor of the East India Company), and Roe's "my lady
Elizabeth" of Bohemia. We do not know if these portraits were decorating
the wall when Roe was initiated, but it would appear that they were a
common fixture at the court. Roe mentions them again in March of the
following year, and a Mughal portrait painted in 1640 depicting Jahangir
and his son Prince Khurram (the future Shah Jahan) in late 1617 features
the English paintings prominently on the wall behind the throne. See
<EM>King of all the World</EM>, 97 (fig.  39), and <EM>Embassy of Sir
Thomas</EM>, I, 143; Q, 394. Jahangir had received these wall portraits
from the failed diplomatic mission of the Company trader William Hawkins
a few years earlier.  <a href="#R48">Back</a>

<P><A NAME="N_50_">50. </A> Though it is thought
that the pendant portrait was by Isaac Oliver, the identity of the woman
is a mystery. It seems unlikely that it was the princess Elizabeth,
since she was alive and well at the time. Foster, the editor of Roe's
memoir, suggests that she is Roe's recently wedded wife, but this person
in fact survived Roe himself and died in 1675 (<EM>Embassy of Sir Thomas
Roe</EM>, I, 254-255, footnote 1). Foster nevertheless speculates
unconvincingly that Roe wished to keep his marriage secret. In any case,
what is more significant is the fact that Jahangir actually seems to
have worn one of the copies he had made; he is pictured wearing such a
pendant in the 1640 Mughal portrait (<EM>King of all the World</EM>,
202-203 [fig. 123]).  <a href="#R50">Back</a>
