<P><b>Preface </b>

<P> This book is about the life of Dil Das, a North Indian 
villager who was born in the lower ranges of the Himalayas. 
Although Dil Das spent most of his life as a peasant farmer 
raising buffaloes and selling their milk, and was poor by 
almost any standard, most of the stories he told were not 
about everyday life, but about great adventures. Shooting 
tigers and leopards with kings, princes, and politicians; trekking 
into the high Himalayas with missionary families; traveling to 
Nepal to join an American friend in building and running a 
luxury resort in a wildlife refuge; and endless tales about 
friendship and hunting that seemed to have nothing to do with 
culture as such, but a great deal to do with the history of 
colonialism. What I have set out to do in this book is make 
sense of this very local, very personal history of colonialism 
and the relationship therein between culture and a biography 
of encounter. As such, this book is about the problematic, 
intimate interface of difference in the postcolonial world. 
It is about the meaning of friendship between Anglo-Saxon 
Protestant missionary men and a low-caste Hindu peasant, 
people who, if left to their own devices, would be regarded 
as coming from worlds apart, even though they spent 
most of their lives together. 

<P>Since I am a son of a missionary, and a long time friend of a 
low-caste peasant, as well as an anthropologist who has conducted 
field research in the village where Dil Das was born, this book is 
also about the problematic interface of ethnography and colonial 
or postcolonial encounter. It deals directly with the moral  
ambiguity of writing and living in a field of power where, despite  
intimacy, self and other are not equal; where the legacy of 
colonialism relentlessly undermines the praxis of friendship, and 
where a condition of friendship makes anthropology, if not 
impossible, at least morally violent. This book is, therefore, 
about the limits of friendship and knowledge; about the way in 
which missionary lives defined a structure of power in which Dil 
Das lived, through which he spoke, and, I think, as a consequence 
of which he died. This book is, [<i>++Page xii  <b>Preface</b> 
</i>]

 therefore, about both the heroics of representation and the 
tragedy of encounter. 

<P>As I recorded Dil Das's stories, and in subsequent reflections 
on his life, I came to realize that it was impossible to make 
sense of him, to write his story that is, in terms of any standard  
ethnographic categories. One could read his life in purely 
ethnographic terms, and extract from it pieces which, when fit 
together, would make sense in terms of peasant life in North 
India, caste hierarchy in North India, social change in North India, 
or some other phraseology of social science. But this is 
not the point. That some might blithely engage in such an endeavor  
is the point of my contention, for Dil Das simply did not clearly 
stand for any discrete social reality -- regional, national, 
historical, or ethnographic. He defied classification, and my 
efforts at classification seemed to undermine precisely that which  
made him human. Moreover, as I experimented with various methods 
of representing his life, it became clear that I could not 
extricate myself from the text without doing a great deal of 
violence to his narrative. In telling stories about himself, Dil 
Das was telling stories in which I was directly implicated, not as  
an ethnographer but as a family friend. 


<P>Because Dil Das tells his story to, through, and with 
missionaries, a word is in order on this category of person. In 
North India in general, and the town of Mussoorie near Dil Das's 
village in particular-but also probably everywhere -- there are 
missionaries and there are missionaries. Some are blinded by faith  
and preoccupied with their own spiritual convictions, but there 
are others who, while deeply motivated by their beliefs, are more 
concerned with resolving worldly problems. They have profound 
faith in the prospect that, in the end, the human spirit will 
prevail. Among missionaries such as these there is little talk of 
salvation, as such, and even less preaching per se, but there is a  
deep, undying faith in basic human goodness. Most of the 
missionaries Dil Das encountered and befriended were of this kind,  
some more radical than others, but all involved in social work and  
reform of some sort. And so there are few if any religious 
undertones to the stories he tells. There is no search for God. 
There are, however, very strong humanitarian overtones. 

<P>And it is here, despite the virtue of goodness and faith in 
human kindness, where I see a problem of moral ambiguity and 
political impropriety. I see a problem in the work of social 
reform, development work, and various kinds of community service 
that are predicated on the universality of human experience in a 
starkly differentiated, hierarchical world where inequality and 
injustice are constantly reproduced. I take it on faith, following  
Nietzsche and Foucault -- as well as Marx -- that we create our 
own history, but we do not live the history we create. And so the 
larger consequences of our actions are hardly ever manifest in the   

[<i><b>Preface</b> ++page xiii</i>] 

specific goals of our intent. As good-intentioned, liberal, often 
radical humanists, those of us implicated in the stories Dil Das 
told are fundamentally "nice people," if such a normal category is  
able to exist in a world whose postmodern logic makes 
self-definition virtually impossible. However, there is also 
something fundamentally wrong with the consequences of our 
actions. 

<P>Had Dil Das been the target of a successful evangelical 
project, it would be easy and perhaps reassuring to squarely lay 
the blame and clearly define the criteria of condemnation. Had he 
been obviously exploited by landlords or alienated through the 
interests of venture capitalism, one could voice any number of 
clearly articulated protests, and chart a clear course of action. 
Had he only been an outcast, and simply been made to suffer the 
stigma of oppressive untouchability, it would be easy to envision 
an alternative world of justice and equality. But when inequality 
and injustice are intertwined with friendship, and when extreme 
differences in wealth, power, and status are, in some sense, the 
criteria of intimacy, rather than its undoing, one is dealing with  
a very different animal. This animal appears tame and docile 
enough -- even friendly -- but is, in fact, more dangerous in 
spite of itself, and for that very reason. I can only ask those of   
this species who are explicitly implicated in this book to realize  
that my intention is not to blame or "bad name" anyone, but to in 
some way come to terms with a problem of moral justice for which I  
feel directly responsible; a beastly problem of justice which 
elides the civilizing rhetoric of human virtue. 

<P>What I have written is based on Dil Das's memory, Dil Das's 
imagination, and my own situated knowledge. Contrary to what 
anthropology requires, and what good judgment demands, I have made  
absolutely no attempt to corroborate anything Dil Das said about 
other people. I am sure that much of what he said is true. I am 
also sure that he fabricated a great many of the stories in which 
many of his friends figure prominently. While I make no apology 
for what I have written, I must apologize to those people in Dil 
Das's life -- Ernie Campbell, Ray Smith, and John Coapman in 
particular, Dil Das's boyhood friends and fellow hunters; to 
Robert C. Alter and Ellen Alter, my parents, Stephen Alter and 
Andrew Alter, my brothers, and by extension my whole family; to 
Ratnu, Sheri, Rukam, and Tara, Dil Das's brothers; to Azad and 
Sunder, his nephews; to Abloo, Tulasi, and Jankhi, his uncles; and  
to his last wife Rani Devi and daughter, Gura. I have no doubt 
that John Coapman, Ray Smith and Ernie Campbell in particular 
would remember the things they did with Dil Das in very different 
ways. 

<P>With regard to my own situated knowledge, I fully concede that 
I have, in some sense, appropriated Dil Das's voice and have 
translated a heroic autobiography into a biography that seeks to 
communicate more 

[<i>++page xiv  <b>Preface</b></i>] 

than just a life story. If Dil Das had had his way, for example, 
the title of this book would be simply <i>Tiger</i>. But that 
would have led to entrapment and capture, to a fiction of untamed 
freedom, or, worse still, to extinction. The story I have written 
is, therefore, a story of half-truths, partial knowledge, and 
inevitable distortions. In this sense it is based on and 
reproduces hearsay rather than eyewitness. As such, following the 
epigraphs from Alberuni and Barthes, it suggests a different way 
of seeing more truly whole realities. 

<P>The structure I have imposed on Dil Das's narrative is 
completely contrived from start to finish. Therefore, it is 
particularly important to present, at the outset, the research 
method I designed to produce Dil Das's narrative, a history of my 
analysis of the narrative text, and a brief genealogy of my 
thinking on the subject as a whole. 

<P>During the summer of 1985 I spent three months at my family's 
estate in the Himalayan town of Mussoorie, and at Dil Das's home 
seven kilometers away in the village of Pathreni, recording the 
stories Dil Das told about himself. I told him that I was 
interested in recording his life, and then captured everything he 
said on tape. I also kept a journal of what else we did, which 
included going on hunting trips, attending weddings, participating  
in ritual events, dropping in on friends, and walking to town to 
pick up supplies. 

<P>Dil Das's style of narration was enigmatic to say the least. It  
was often very difficult to know when he was telling a story -- as  
opposed to just talking -- and virtually impossible, at times, to 
disentangle beginnings, middles, and ends. He would often indicate  
when he wanted the tape recorder on, and was always aware of the 
machine's presence. So it is possible to say that Dil Das's 
discourse, no matter how rambling and disengaged, was always, or 
at least almost always, consciously and thematically structured. 
Nevertheless, I recorded long passages that, when transcribed 
literally, read like a rambling collection of words, half 
sentences, and exclamations and made little sense. Many of the 
more readily comprehensible tales are pithy, devoid of context, 
and frankly anecdotal. And yet, at times, Dil Das told very 
coherent stories that are easier to understand and locate within a  
biographical framework. Even so, these biographical fragments are 
often so full of intimate (as opposed to local) knowledge that 
they would be virtually incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with  
the larger context of our fused lives. 

<P>In response to my stated goals, Dil Das told me the story of 
his life, but each story was clearly a unit unto itself -- or else  
a meandering flow of consciousness -- and there was no discernible  
chronology or logical progression to the tales he told. 
Significantly, however, the stories were narrated while we were 
either sitting in his home or walking through the mountains. It 
was, more often than not, the basic geography of the  

[<i><b>Preface</b>  ++page xv</i>]  

forest around the village of Pathreni that gave the narrative a 
degree of coherence. It was our happenstance encounter with 
people, places, and things that triggered Dil Das's memory and 
thereby evoked a narrative structured by random nouns of the 
present rather than by history, life, or identity. When Dil Das 
told a story, I grunted, nodded, and otherwise showed that I was 
following the conversation, but I did not speak. Again, contrary 
to good ethnographic method, and perhaps even good manners, I did 
not ask questions or seek clarification. When he was not telling a  
story, we rarely if ever talked about the project. 

<P>Transcribing Dil Das's narrative was extremely difficult, and 
the exercise has contributed to my skepticism about the 
relationship between knowledge and truth. Although Dil Das was a 
master storyteller, it was difficult to produce a meaningful 
translation of stories that seemed caught halfway between memory 
and speech. To be sure, I could have sat down with Dil Das and 
clarified certain points. I could have asked him any number of 
things in order to start making sense of what he said while he 
spoke. But I wanted him to come as close as he possibly could to 
writing and that required a much higher degree of strategic 
silence than dialogic engagement; all of which may seem 
counterintuitive, but then again participant observation is 
precisely ambiguous on the critical point of communication. 

<P>I divided the 30 hours of narrative into 185 more or less 
cohesive tales. I translated each cassette tape, and then worked 
over each story numerous times in order to capture the meaning and  
flavor of the original telling. I then read through all the 
stories, in conjunction with my journal, in light of my memories, 
and experimented with various methods of classification. Early on 
I realized that chronology was not a very useful mode of 
organization. To follow the sequence of Dil Das, who told 
particular stories on the basis of what geography brought to mind 
-- a rock here, a vista there, a <i>chan</i> (hamlet or cow shed) 
in the valley -- was simply too enigmatic. In the end I organized 
the stories thematically. Then I went back to the original 
narrative text and merged the shortest, least coherent tales into 
congruent longer ones, and cut out a large number of redundancies.  
This left me with roughly one hundred stories, about 80 percent of  
which dealt with hunting. 

<P>My original goal in recording Dil Das's narrative had been to 
present Garhwali peasant culture through the eyes of one man, and 
so even in the early stages of translation, working in 1985 I was 
still not fully aware of the effect of Dil Das's commentary on my 
life and our shared past. I was, however, painfully aware of the 
fact that his story of hunting was not very useful, or noteworthy,  
as a document of culture. After Dil Das died in 1986, I had 
reached a point from which I could see no return, and not much 
future, so I put the project away [<i>++page xvi  <b>Preface</b>
</i>]  

I started rereading the stories again in 1992, this time from a 
completely new perspective. Rather than look for culture, I saw 
that Dil Das was talking against culture in order to produce what 
I am calling a hybrid history of encounter. From this viewpoint I 
could make sense of the narrative precisely in those terms which 
had earlier seemed to render it useless -- his ambivalence toward 
dairying, his obsession with hunting, and above all his 
celebration of friendship. I have used these thematic categories 
to organize Dil Das's life story, but I have not selectively 
included stories in order to exaggerate the significance of 
certain themes. 

<P>Much as I would have liked to, it would be impractical to 
publish all the tales Dil Das told. I have therefore included 
about half the stories, primarily those which are least enigmatic 
and most coherent, while still keeping the basic thematic ratio of  
the original collection intact. The stories, therefore, are chosen  
on the basis of their own merit to provide a focused biographical 
synopsis. These are a representative sample of what I collected, 
and many of them are stories Dil Das told over and over again. 

<P>However, given the fact that my family and I figure in a 
significant number of the stories Dil Das told, I have chosen to 
include most of these and exclude those stories that refer to 
characters who appear far less often. This limits the number of 
personal names that come into play, and provides coherence, 
critical focus, and continuity to Dil Das's story of encounter. It  
should be abundantly clear that I have chosen to write about 
myself and my family for no other reason than because Dil Das 
chose to bring us into his narrative. 

<P>In translating Dil Das's life story into some kind of 
comprehensible, public knowledge I have strategically played with 
the context of meaning, played with what both Dil Das and I could 
take for granted. I have done this in order to entertain, to make 
sense, and also work out -- in an autobiographical way -- where 
exactly I stand in relation to the subject of this biography. On 
one level, though, I am just doing what Di1 Das always did -- 
spinning a good yarn in order to have some fun, make some sense of  
things, enjoy life, and pass the time. By extension I am 
fulfilling an obligation by writing a book I had promised to 
write. But it is a book that also, I hope, broadens the appeal of 
these stories, defines their context, and gives them permanent 
form -- a kind of immortality about which I have ambivalent 
intimations. But as Dil Das often pointed out, "whatever else is 
said about anyone, good must be said about him. Something, 
anything good must be said on his behalf. Then, even when he dies 
he will stay alive."

[<i><b>Preface</b> ++page xvii</i>] 

<P>This book is composed of four parts, whose titles are taken 
from the poet Tulsi Das's epic <i>Ramacaritmanas</i>. Part I, Bal 
Kand, the Book of Childhood, focuses on childhood memories of 
hunting in and around the American community of Landour, the 
village of Pathreni, and the hill station of Mussoorie. Part II, 
Aranya Kand, the Forest Book, deals with the time in Dil Das's 
life when he and John Coapman traveled and hunted together. Part 
III, Shram Kand, the Book of Labor, concerns the relationship 
between hunting, hard work, and the transactions of dairying in a 
petty-capitalist economy. Part IV, Uttarkhand, seeks the 
confluence of caste, class, colonialism, and friendship. Part I 
deals with boyhood adventures, Part II with a kind of forest 
exile, Part III with a return home to reality -- if not Ayodhya 
per se -- and Part IV simply with the perils of Himalayan life. 
Throughout it is a battle with demons and a search for something 
lost, as well as a devotional hymn of sorts. Parts I, II, and III 
each contain three chapters. The first chapter in each part is my 
reflections or background on some aspect of Dil Das's story. The 
second chapter in each part is a collection of stories told by Dil  
Das as I have translated them. Each part concludes with a short 
essay by me. In Part IV, Chapter 10 is in Dil Das's voice, and 
Chapter 11 is my reflections on the themes raised in Dil Das's 
life story.

<b>Dil Das-Enslaved Heart </b></font>

<P> Dil Das was a poor, low-caste, Himalayan peasant who defined 
himself, heroically, as a hunter of animals, and as a close friend  
of the missionary children he hunted with. I knew Dil Das 
progressively well from the time I was about ten as the son of 
American missionaries working in North India, until his death in 
1986 when I was twenty-nine and he was about sixty. 

<P>Our families go way back, as they say -- almost three 
generations. My grandparents and parents knew Dil Das and his 
father as <i>dudwallas</i>: men who delivered milk to our 
community. I knew Dil Das and his family first when I was growing 
up in North India between 1958 and 1977, and then, from 1980 on, 
as an anthropologist. 

<P>Dil Das was born in the Garhwali village of Pathreni about 
seven kilometers to the east of Mussoorie, a resort town or hill 
station, which gained prominence and jaded notoriety as a place 
for elite recreation and gay entertainment during the era of 
British imperialism. He was the son of an illiterate, untouchable 
basket-weaver who migrated south to the Himalayan foothills from a  
village near the source of the river Ganga. I was born in 
Mussoorie, in the Landour Community Hospital. My parents were 
among the American missionaries, who, for the past seventy years 
or so, have been, in various ways, associated with Woodstock, a 
Christian boarding school at the east end of town. Because 
Woodstock, and the people who went to Woodstock as teachers and 
students, came to play a central role in Dil Das's memory of 
himself, I must begin the story of a Garhwali villager by 
describing a rather strange permutation of Western lives. 

<P>I grew up in the curious, postcolonial environment of Landour 
where the culture was, until the late 1970s, equal parts North 
American mid-western Christian and British colonial. Woodstock, 
which largely defines this culture, was, for all practical 
purposes, an American prep school where one was far more likely to  
read Chaucer, Shakespeare, Whitman, and Poe than the great Indian 
poets like Valmiki, Mira, or Tulsi Das be- [<i>++Page 4  <b>Bal 
Kand / The Book of Childhood</b></i>] 

fore being graduated to attend college in the United States -- 
anything from Baptist bible college in the South to Ivy League 
university in the Northeast. 

<P>Academic conformity notwithstanding, it is hard to describe 
this environment exactly, because it was not what we thought it 
was. Imagine 350 predominantly white middle-class Protestant 
missionary children -- and a large minority of elite, Westernized 
Indians -- both groups born and raised in small out-of-the-way 
places and trying to be, in some way, and with various degrees of 
consciousness, American, while at the same time either unclear, 
critical, or simply confused about what being American meant. Who 
we were (and are, I suppose) is not so much people caught between 
two worlds, as people who are condemned to conceive of ourselves 
in terms of something that we are not; reluctant Americans who 
played basketball, joined the Boy Scouts and went trekking, 
listened to Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, and the Beatles, crowned May 
queens, and danced around the May Pole. We read Hemingway while 
taking Christian Endeavor retreats to a place called Satya 
Narayan, which means "God's Truth," and learned Christmas carols 
in languages our friends "at home" spoke in order to entertain 
grandparents who lived far away. We wore Levis and T-shirts, bell 
bottoms, tie-dyed <i>kurtas</i>, and Nehru jackets. And yet 
whenever I visited America (and even now after twenty years) it 
seems like a foreign country. It is all the more alien because it 
is supposed to be, in some fundamental way and despite extreme 
emotional ambivalence, home, that place that Woodstock sought to 
define but simply could not be because of where it was. Its 
location, 280 kilometers north of Delhi on the first range of the 
Himalayas, to be exact, was, less precisely, in a highly 
mythologized India. We imagined ourselves to be strangely yet 
concretely part of this India by virtue of birth and language on 
the one hand, and environment on the other -- that which is born 
from the epic, utopian union of Father Land and Mother Tongue. 

<P>As an international school, Woodstock prided itself over the 
years on its multicultural environment. Growing up in this 
environment I took for granted that this pride was well founded. 
We did, after all, come into close, long-term contact with people 
whose "culture" put our own into critical perspective. For many of 
us English was not our first language. But looking back, it now 
seems that we had somehow convinced ourselves that our unique 
cross-cultural perspective on things was characteristic of an 
unbounded global world view when in fact it was simply a measure 
of our idiosyncratic modern insularity. Our "exposure" to 
different things was fairly complete. Along with the ritual 
priests at the Kedarnath temple, the lines of beggars at Rishikesh 
come to mind, as do the shepherds with their massive, barb-studded 
steel-collared <i>bho- </i> [<i><b>Dil Das -- Enslaved Heart</b> 
++page 5</i>]  <i>tiya</i> hounds, who herd flocks of sheep and 
goats down out of the alpine meadows into the lower valleys not 
far from the school. But "difference" as such was never really 
allowed to break down the fundamentals of a culture which, despite 
the input of people from all over the world, was strictly defined 
by a Christian world view and incipient First-World modernism. 

<P>Leaving aside, if I may judiciously employ Dil Das's profanity 
of choice, the narrow minded input of "sister-fucking 
evangelicals," perhaps there are some for whom Woodstock's liberal 
humanism has provided a global perspective, an international 
identity nervously compatible with the transnational nature of 
postmodernizing culture-and it is here where I would like to pay 
my debt. But it is also, and despite its best intentions, a 
provincial parochial place that has given birth to a form of 
shallow, sentimental Orientalism in which India, as a romantic 
ideal, fills a deep void left by our emotional ambivalence about 
being people without an identity. This Orientalism is not exactly 
the same as that which evolved in the purely imperial imagination 
and colonial experience of men like Sir Richard Burton or T. E. 
Lawrence. Our image of self and other was scaled down. It was less 
magically epic and more mystically intimate, but still implicated 
in the production of monumental difference. 

<P>Many of us who went to Woodstock enjoyed hiking, and the 
environment of the Himalayas is well suited to this form of 
recreation. Treks to particular mountains, springs, lakes, and 
rivers -- Nag Tibba, Smith's Hole, Deodital, and the Aglar -- 
would follow trails which, because they were meant for more 
practical and less leisure purposes, often led to and from 
villages. And so I suppose it is not surprising that these 
villages became, for us, part of a timeless, picturesque, natural 
landscape, named, to be sure, and populated by people whose names 
were often known, but experienced anonymously in purely aesthetic 
terms. In wood smoke and cow dung, carved wooden pillars and slate 
roofs, homemade water pipes and women'sjewelry, even the wrinkles 
on an old man's face, or his calloused hands spinning wool into 
yarn, there was a curious melding of sensuality, knowledge, and 
intimate strangeness. In the 1970s we would have called it funky 
(which is, as one of my teachers rightly pointed out, a good 
"ethnographic" term). The everyday things of the people in these 
villages evoked, in those of us who lived in another world not far 
off, a sense of mystical intimacy with difference. There was also 
a sense in which this funky experience of the rustic, "grungy" 
character of the villagers came to represent, I think, some kind 
of basic Christian desire for that which was essentially good and 
uncorrupted in everyone. Not in so many words, of course, for that 
would break the spell, even for those of us who had critically 
secularized a faith we could not lose, but I think 

 [<i>++page 6  <b>Bal Kand / The Book of Childhood</b></i>] 

 there was something about "camping out" in a humble cow 
shed-along with the ox and the ass, if you will -- which, by 
bringing a search for self and God together in the imaginary, 
exotic space of village India, undermined the history of 
industrial progress -- the spirit of capitalism, if you will -- 
with a kind of passionate, discursive humanism, while giving to 
the obliquity of our Western, or Westernized lives, a certain 
meaningful significance. 

<P>On the surface Woodstock school and Pathreni village are worlds 
apart in every way, and yet it is in terms of Woodstock and his 
encounter with "alienated" Protestant missionary children that Dil 
Das tells his story. It is in this way that I, among others, am 
implicated in his narrative. And, symmetrically speaking, as an 
anthropologist with an incriminating past, I have implicated Dil 
Das in my own narrative by having chosen to tell my stories, both 
intellectual and personal, through an encounter with him and other 
Garhwali villagers. 

<P>But narratives are never whole realities, nor do stories always 
capture the truth. Sometimes narratives make reference to a 
reality about which nothing or very little is ever said, even 
though it is regarded, by all concerned, as being of fundamental 
importance. In Dil Das's case this unspoken fact of life -- a 
cultural fact of immense importance, to be sure -- was the absence 
of a son. He tried for many years to ensure that his name would be 
carried on. He only gave up hope for good when his third wife was 
diagnosed with cervical cancer, the same disease that had killed 
her two predecessors. But while holding on to hope, and then when 
giving it up, Dil Das did not speak about his failure. In fact, 
being without an heir was of so much significance that it did not 
need to be articulated. It simply was the single most important 
fact of life in an otherwise fictional domain of experience. It 
stands, therefore, in some sense, as the signified -- the 
eyewitnessed but unspoken -- of all the signifiers that follow. 
Much of what Dil Das did can be explained from this point of 
reference, for without a son he was both the object of pity and 
self-recrimination, but also more or less free to live for the 
moment, and for himself, rather than required by convention to 
invest in the future. However, the absence of a son also made Dil 
Das into a storyteller, a raconteur reflecting on the past rather 
than one looking to the future. And perhaps in telling stories to 
me he was talking to a son, of sorts, and also perhaps thereby 
constructing a legacy. 

<P>Dil Das knew, of course, that I was going to write a book about 
our conversations -- his stories about me and mine about him. He 
had, I think, a great deal of fun telling these stories. And there 
is no denying the fact that he also derived -- as have I -- a 
great deal of satisfaction, and a feeling of enhanced self worth, 
from the project of writing as a whole. But he did not know, 
fully, how he would be written and read. And so, [<i><b>Dil Das -- 
Enslaved Heart </b>++page 7</i>]  behind the heroic bravado and 
pure joy of "having lived a good life," as he put it, there is in 
Dil Das's voice, I think, a deep sense of self-doubt end pain -- 
born of being poor and outcaste, of having not produced a son, of 
having been widowed three times, and of having wandered too far 
from home -- that compelled him to spin a good yarn and take so 
much pride and pleasure in being something he was not quite. For 
my part I do not fully understand the implications of having 
written Dil Das out of a framework of pure friendship and into the 
ambiguous complicity of a text that promises more than simply a 
new perspective on us and them, me and him, being here and being 
there, by looking closely at the intimate questions of self-doubt 
that are born of encounter. 

<P>Dil Das was more than willing to narrate his life experiences 
since he prided himself on being a master raconteur. However, what 
gave him license to speak, as it were, was the fact that he was 
"unemployed" during the summer of 1985, and was not looking for 
work. His income came from a contract he had to deliver milk to 
the kitchen at Woodstock School, and he subcontracted this to his 
younger brother in exchange for a regular stipend. In any case, 
Dil Das was never too concerned with the routine of work and 
labor, and had, as we shall see, a rather ambivalent attitude 
toward his role in the peasant economy. All of which is to say 
that he had both the time and inclination to talk at great length 
with me about his past. 

<P>One of the reasons I originally wanted to record Dil Das's life 
was that he seemed to clearly represent a certain configuration of 
power. I have said that he was inherently impossible to classify, 
a point that I will explain momentarily, but he did, on the 
surface, appear to fit neatly into a network of labels generated 
by colonial and postcolonial discourses alike: intellectual, 
linguist, secular humanist reformer, Marxist, and post-structural 
cultural critic. These labels seemed to fix his identity in terms 
of the larger workings of the empire and its academic, 
administrative, national heirs. In these terms Dil Das was a 
Pahari, a person from the hills and mountains of northern Uttar 
Pradesh. By virtue of the language he spoke-among friends, family 
and neighbors-he was also a Garhwali. As an Auji or Baijgi, he 
belonged to a caste of drummers and musicians who also weave 
bamboo baskets. By virtue of this caste group's position in the 
hierarchy of other such groups, Dil Das was also an outcast; a 
stigmatized untouchable. Officially, therefore, he was a Harijan; 
a "child of god" in the apologetic nomenclature of modern, secular 
India and a Dalit in the Ambedkarite language of opposition to 
this nomenclature. Because of where he lived and what he did, as a 
tiller of the soil, he was a poor peasant who owned a small parcel 
of unproductive land. Consequently, he was a member of an 
exploited, disenfranchised underclass -- a classic subaltern. 
[<i>++page 8  <b>Bal Kand / The Book of Childhood</b></i>] 

<P>Given the weight and specificity of these myriad labels, one 
must legitimately ask what I mean by claiming that Dil Das defies 
classification. I mean that Dil Das resists these modes of 
classification. He tells a story that dismantles this 
configuration of power, a story of self against society while 
caught in a web of normative social facts. Ignoring the terms of 
caste and class, stigma and poverty, language and place, Dil Das 
called himself a <i>skikari</i>: a hunter. For him hunting was an 
obsession, an all-consuming passion that defined his identity. 
Significantly, he shared this obsession with a number of young men 
from the American missionary community in Landour, in particular 
Ernie Campbell and Ray Smith, but above all others John Coapman 

<P>I do not know when Dil Das first started hunting. It must have 
been when he was a young man, around 1947. However, it is very 
clear from the stories he tells that he soon began to identify 
closely with the young men from Woodstock School who came to the 
forest around his village to shoot pheasant, <i>kakar</i> (barking 
deer), <i>gkoral</i> (mountain goat), and leopard. To a degree in 
fact, but most significantly in Dil Das's memory, hunting merged 
his and the missionary boys' identities, and thereby superseded 
and rendered irrelevant all differences of class, caste, 
nationality, religion, and language. The intimate experience of 
hunting together radically decentered the prevailing structure of 
power and provided a means by which Dil Das could redefine himself 
outside the framework of normal classification. 

<P>The curious thing about hunting is that it seems strikingly 
incongruous to the encounter of missionaries and peasants, neither 
of whom are, in any sense, typical hunters. The political economy 
of hunting does not seem to make sense in terms either of an 
agrarian mode of production or a calling to save souls. Quite 
apart from blood sport as such, as a vocation, as a mode of 
production, and as a way of life, hunting is not particularly 
loaded with cultural meaning in twentieth-century North India. 
That is, it does not so much define a specific category of person 
as an arena of passion and infatuation. Precisely because of this, 
however, it does provide an alternative framework for 
self-perception and the construction of identity. Which means that 
when the sons of missionaries hunted with the son of a peasant in 
the lower Himalayas between 1940 and 1984 they were able to merge 
their self-images through hunting on neutral ground. 

<P>It is important to keep in mind that both peasants and 
missionaries were marginal actors -- albeit to different degrees, 
and with different allegiances -- in the drama of empire building, 
and that their encounter, as bunters in the jungles of northern 
India, was categorically different from the epic drama of colonial 
and precolonial blood sport: "the sport of kings:" Hunting of this 
sort among the imperial elite was an activity [<i><b>Dil Das -- 
Enslaved Heart</b> ++page 9</i>]

 conducted on a massive scale with scores of elephants, beaters, 
gunbearers, scouts, cooks, porters, and valets. In 
pre-independence India, hunting was transformed into a fine art of 
excess in which the size of the bag -- four tigers, five swamp 
deer, twelve boar, fifteen pheasant, eight peafowl, and two dozen 
rock pigeons, for example -- had to keep pace with the scale of 
the expedition in a kind of frenetic leisure parody of 
subsistence. Along these lines, blood sport may be understood as a 
direct extension of imperial conquest, a kind of overt enactment 
of covert intentions, a ritualized and often dramatic penetration 
of the jungle to "bag a trophy"-to possess in that most final of 
all ways, by killing. Whatever else blood sport may be, it is, 
essentially, heroic to the point of self-parody; a leisure 
activity that underscores, and allegorically engenders, the moral 
economy of colonialism. 

<P>Despite what might be called the innocence of encounter in Dil 
Das's memory, it is, ultimately, the power-saturated significance 
of "the sport of kings" with which he must come to terms in his 
own narrative. He and his missionary compatriots hunted in the 
shadow of an imperial allegory that, in part, defined colonial 
identity at large. The freedom from structure and class while 
hunting in and around Mussoorie and Pathreni was meaningful, in 
the context of postindependence India, precisely because of the 
legacy of the colonial allegory. And the mutable space Dil Das and 
his friends had created always ran the risk of being subverted by 
the terms of this more literal metaphor of power. Moreover, as an 
adult, Dil Das hunted with rajas, maharajahs, and various members 
of the colonial and postcolonial elite. He became enamored of 
blood sport, and his own story is -- ironically and tragically -- 
constructed in terms of this imperial allegory of power. He tells 
his story within the rubric of "the sport of kings," and this 
raises the problematic question of where, in the end, does Dil Das 
-- the hero of his own narrative -- stand in relation to the 
colonial drama that inspired him. The missionaries with whom he 
hunted on the fringes of the empire were able, for the most part, 
to make their escape into nostalgia by leaving India and going 
"back home" to the United States. There they were able to retell 
-- or strategically forget -- the myth of complicity from a 
perspective that could ignore the implications of what they had 
done. Dil Das, in contrast, had no choice but to stay, and the 
complicity that had animated his narrative as it fused with 
theirs, became a half-story of tragic heroism and enslaved 
imagination. Until his death in 1986 he remained caught between 
memory, allegory, and the harsh reality of peasant life. He ended 
up telling a story about himself that promised escape, encoded 
enslavement, and bespoke, consequently, the tragedy of encounter.

<P> "School had just reopened, and all of the children had come 
back up to Mussoorie from the plains where they had been for the 
winter holidays. Back then there were many 
<i><a href="#sahibs">sahibs</a></i>* who came hunting in our 
jungle, but Ray Smith was different. He was a hunter; a real 
hunter." 

<P>"In those days I was young and did not know very much. As I 
have told you, [Ernie] Campbell was my guru. When I went hunting, 
it was with his gun, his ammunition, and his planning. I didn't 
even know which gun was which. I would just go and pick one out of 
the cupboard and hunt. These are great things I am telling you; 
things to think about. But anyway, Ray Smith and I hunted together 
and he wanted me to tell him if I ever heard of a chance to shoot 
a leopard." 

<P>"It is the village children who know where leopards are. They 
tend the cattle and the sheep and goats and come across leopards 
in the jungle. We were waiting for news of a fresh kill so that we 
could make plans. And we needed to get word in the morning so that 
we could be at the site by evening of the same day." 

<P>"One morning, on my way into town, one of the village children 
who knew that I was interested in these things gave me the word 
that a cow had been killed by a leopard over near Kimoi. I had to 
deliver milk, so I went on into Landour. But after quickly 
finishing my work I carne back to Ray Smith's house in order to 
tell him and make plans. He wasn't there, but the <i>memsahib</i> 
[madam], his mother, showed me a place to rest, and I slept until 
noon."

*The term <i>sahib</i> can be translated as an honorific title

relationship marking relative class status. Although used casually

someone like Ray Smith, who was at the time a senior in high 
school, it evokes a colonial relationship in spite of what may or

------------------------------------------------------<p>

[<i><b>Woodstock School</b> ++page 11</i>]

<P>"Finally, after school had finished, Ray Smith came and we 
began to talk and make plans for the hunt. It was getting late, so 
we took the carbine apart and put it in a bag to hide it from the 
forest guard and then headed out for Jaunpur. I dropped off my 
milk containers at home, and then we set off again toward Jhak and 
Panch Ram's <i>chan</i> [hamlet or cow shed] by way of Masrana. I 
guess it must have been one of his cows that was killed. Anyway, 
we set out from there in search of the kill wondering what would 
happen if we actually shot the leopard." 

<P>"Down in the valley below Jhak there is a cremation ground, and 
nearby we found where the leopard, or what we thought was a 
leopard, had pissed. The piss was warm, so the leopard must have 
been just in front of us. It must have gotten scared when it heard 
us approaching. We went on slowly, up the slope of the mountain to 
a ridge where there was an oak tree and some bushes. I saw 
something moving in the bushes and could just make out half of a 
body and what I thought must have been a leopard's tail. Ray Smith 
could see it too, but said to me that he thought it was a 
<i>barasingha</i> [a "twelve-horned" deer]. I said, `I don't know; 
I'm not sure; barasingha aren't usually found in these mountain 
jungles; they aren't usually found in my jungle. But, in any case, 
shoot the damn thing and we'll find out!' So we went on up slowly 
and reached the ridge. The bushes in which we had seen the animal 
were not very far away; maybe as far away as that than over there, 
about fifteen meters. From the top of the ridge we could see down 
below where a buffalo was grazing across the stream, and where a 
ravine ran up the opposite slope past some chans. Had we not 
approached very slowly and quietly the leopard -- or what we 
thought was a leopard -- would have heard us and run off. We were 
very careful:' 

<P>"Now, what we thought was a barasingha in the bushes turned out 
to be what we thought was a leopard! Whatever it was, it had now 
turned in our direction and was moving slightly. It was dusk now, 
about 6:30 or 7:00, and getting dark, but there was still just 
enough light to shoot. Taking aim, Ray Smith fired, and the 
carbine went `Phutt!' And then right away he fired again, and hit 
the leopard -- or what we thought was a leopard -- in the chest. 
Much to our relief it fell down. We were thrilled!" 

<P>"Now, in those days I didn't know what I now know. It was on 
that day that I first learned the English word `tiger,' for a 
leopard is a leopard, but this thing we had shot had stripes! I 
said to Ray Smith, `OK, let's lift it up and carry it home.' So I 
bent down and tried to lift one end, but it wouldn't budge. I 
didn't have enough strength to even move it an inch. `OK,' I said, 
`let's hide it over there behind those bushes, and then we'll go 
home for help.' So that is what we did, and we left the gun behind 
too and ran back toward the school." 

<P>"At Bhataghat we met a forest guard, but we said nothing and 
just ran [<i>++page 12  <b>Bal Kand/The Book of Childhood</b></i>] 

 on until we got back to the school. Then we went to Palisades, 
down below Taftan, and told the sahib -- Ray Smith's father -- 
what we had done. After telling everyone what had happened, we 
returned by way of the Tehri road to retrieve the tiger. We 
brought some coolies with us, and a <i>dandi </i>(a sedan chair) 
to carry the tiger in. John sahib, Campbell sahib, and Smith 
sahib, Ray Smith's father -- all the important men -- also came 
along. They brought torches and their big rifles." 

<P>"Now, what I had done was to place leaves along the path so 
that we would not forget our way back to the place where the 
tiger-we-hadthought-was-a-leopard was. We got as far as Masrana 
when Campbell sahib asked if we really knew where we were going. I 
told him that we were following the leaves. When we got close to 
the spot I said that we should be careful in case the tiger had a 
mate. I told Campbell sahib to take the lead since it was a very 
narrow path and we could not go side by side. He said, `Hey, what 
are you doing, trying to get me killed? You go first. This is your 
doing, after all!"' 

<P>"When we got within range, I took a shotgun and fired a round 
of bird shot into the tiger to make sure it was dead. I shot 
twice. It was then that I told them that I did not know what it 
was that we had shot. It was not an animal from our jungle. 
Campbell sahib and the others said it was a tiger. They told us 
that we should not have shot it, but then they said it would be 
all right; that they would take care of any problem with the 
forest department. Campbell sahib said that we should learn our 
lesson well. It was only because of the carbine that we were 
alive. `Otherwise,' he said, `they would be there collecting our 
bones and not those of the tiger!' " 

<P>"That day there was such a commotion about our having shot a 
tiger that the whole school was shut down. Everyone from Mussoorie 
came to see the tiger and take our picture. Then we began to skin 
it. But what was to be done with the skin since it was illegal to 
kill a tiger? We tried to take it down to Buddhoo Moochi's house 
in Dehra Dun and get him to do the tanning, but all he could say 
was, `What is this? Where did you shoot it?'" 

<P>"Now, there were two officials from the forest department there 
as well, and they began to ask the same questions. I said, 
straight out, `We shot it in my village, where else!' But we had 
no permit, no license, you see, and so we got into trouble. In the 
end the case was taken all the way to the chief conservator of 
forests in Naini Tal. I don't know exactly what happened, but I am 
told that it was only the person who owned the rifle who was held 
accountable, no one else." 

<P>"It was all out in the open. It was a public issue and we did 
not try to hide. Our pictures were taken with the skin, and 
everyone knew who had shot the tiger. Something must have been 
done to resolve the case, however. A fine had to be paid, but it 
was all out in the open. We did not try to hide anything."  
[<i><b>Woodstock School</b> ++page 13</i>]

<P>"The skin of the tiger was kept at the old skating rink for 
some time. I saw it there. One day my friends came to see it, too, 
one of whom was a sardar, a Sikh gentleman. We had a drink 
together and got to talking about the tiger. He said he knew about 
these things and wanted to see where the shot had gone into the 
body. He started looking in the stomach area, but I told him the 
bullet went into the head. But he kept on saying that he knew all 
about tiger shooting and where the bullet must have gone. I told 
him not to talk as though he knew more than he did." 

<P>"Now, my friend, the skin was rightfully ours -- Ray Smith's 
and mine -- and I told everyone who wanted it that they could not 
have it. It was ours. We had shot it. Many big men came to try and 
get their hands on it, but I told them that I was the one they 
would have to talk to. They offered ten thousand rupees. They 
wanted to buy it as a trophy to decorate their homes. In the end 
it was sold; sold by the forest department to someone who knew the 
conservator, I guess. It was rightfully ours, but they sold it for 
ten thousand rupees. And then when they came to carry it away, I 
told them they would need four men to lift the skin, but they 
didn't listen. I said they had better listen to me. I said I 
wouldjust keep talking until they listened. They could not ignore 
me. In the end they lost; all the big sardars I mean. Vinod from 
Hamer and Company [a local shop] was also there. He understood 
what I was saying. He was with me. He understood that I was a 
hunter and that the skin was ours." 

<P>"Now, from that day onward I was a hunter. From that very day, 
mind you. Campbell sahib instructed me; he taught me what I know, 
and he told me that hunting was a dangerous business. But from 
that day I have become addicted to hunting. It is my life." 

<P>* * *

<P>"Ray Smith and I had walked and walked and got all the way to 
Jaunpur; you know the place north of Landour, across the Aglar 
River around Nag Tibba. We pitched our 'camp' in some long, flat 
fields. Then we went down below the lowest field about thirty or 
forty meters and I saw a <i>kakar</i> [a "barking" deer]. But we 
had been walking all day, and I was tired, so we sat down and I 
had a smoke before saying anything. When I was finished I said, as 
though I had just seen it, `There, a kakar has came out of the 
bushes.' Ray had a .22 rifle with him. He fired and hit the deer, 
but it was only wounded and still moving. He always kept one 
cartridge in the chamber and another held between his teeth. He 
did this so that no time would be wasted in reloading. That was 
his style; our style. You can tell people this when you write my 
story. If you see Ray you can remind him. Anyway, he reloaded and 
killed the deer with the second shot." 

<P>"After shooting the kakar, we came back up and visited an old 
man

[<i>++page 14  <b>Bal Kand /The Book of Childhood</b></i>] 

 whose acquaintance we had made. We had stayed with him and he had 
fed us. We had nothing with us except one old sleeping bag; no 
food. We said, thanking him: `You have fed us and we have hunted 
in front of you.' Then I took the deer and presented it to the old 
man. He said, `What am I supposed to do with this?' I said, 'Eat 
it. We cannot take it back to Mussoorie with us.' The old man was 
all alone, poor fellow." 

<P>"Well, the old man was pleased, so he took out some <i>sur</i> 
[a fermented beerlike drink] and gave it to us to drink. We sat 
through the night and cooked the kakar and drank sur. In the 
morning we left and walked up along the ridges as far as Kyari 
village. When we got to the village we told the people we were 
hungry. So what did they do? They got out sur for us to drink. 
They also brought out food, so we ate and drank .... You see, all 
along the way we got food and liquor. We didn't have to worry." 

<P>* * *

<P>"When I was young, probably about my nephew Beeji's age, seven, 
maybe eight years old, or possibly younger, I went with my mother 
to her natal village up beyond Uttarkashi. I remember the road 
even now. There was a rope bridge across the river. 

<P>"Once, many years later, Ray Smith and I went up to a village 
near there where it was reported that a leopard had killed a cow. 
We were going to try and shoot the leopard. However, when we got 
to the village we discovered that the cow had already been eaten, 
and it was too late to sit up over the kill." 

<P>"Since I knew the road, and it was not far, I went on up to my 
mother's village; up where my mamu lives above Uttarkashi. Later 
on Ray Smith and I went up to the fish hatcheries, past the forest 
office on the road to Agora. As we had stopped there to make our 
camp, the forest officer came out and asked us to provide him with 
some meat. I told the officer that the sahib was sleeping. I could 
not wake him and ask, but that since we did have a license we 
would most likely be able to do as he requested." 

<P>"The next morning we went up to the steep slopes above the 
forest office. There we saw three very big ghoral [mountain 
goats]. We had Campbell's old carbine -- who has it now? Mark 
sahib, I think. Yes, that is right. Anyway, Ray Smith fired and 
the goats fell right at our feet! We did not have to move an inch 
or do a thing!" 

<P>"It was getting around the time we had planned to leave. We had 
decided that since the people there at the hatcheries had been so 
helpful we would shoot some ghoral and provide them with meat. 
Just as we were packing up our things and getting ready to go, 
however, the forest guard came and started acting very official. 
He asked us what we thought we were doing shooting ghoral without 
his permission. I said, 

[<i><b>Woodstock School</b> ++page 15</i>] 

 sarcastically: `OK, friend, so this is your game. Yesterday 
everything was fine, but now you have developed an attitude. So 
what's up?'" 

<P>"Now, in those days everything was cheap, even bribes, so I 
offered him a ten-rupee note. But what did he do; he grabbed the 
gun and took it into his house! So I went up to his door and once 
again offered him ten rupees, and also said he could have the 
ghoral we had shot. He would not listen." 

<P>"He was inside making <i>khichari</i> [a mixture of lentils and 
rice], and the rifle was leaning up against the wall in the 
corner. I was standing at his door, you see, and tried to slowly 
sneak in to where I could grab the gun. But then he got upset 
because I had shoes on in his house. Then again I offered him ten 
rupees, and ten more in addition to that, but he would not listen. 
Finally he leaned over to poke the fire and blow on the coals, and 
while he was not looking I jumped, picked up the gun, and whipped 
around. Then I said, while he was still standing there surprised, 
`See here, one shot was fired at the ghoral and there are still 
fourteen left in the clip. Don't move or I'll shoat you in the 
chest!' I fired a warning shot just to emphasize the point." 

<P>"Well, the sahib heard all of this and got worried. He said 
that we had better get back to Uttarkashi. But then we decided not 
to since the forest guard was not about to try anything. He was 
left speechless! Even so, he was bold enough to ask us for the 
inside organs and the head of the goat. I told him to forget about 
it; we were going to take the ghoral up to Deodital and eat it 
there:" 

<P>"We divided up the load between us and started out. I was 
strong. We walked up to those chans just below the bridge where 
there are people from Agora and Kasur. We wanted to cut up the 
goat to make it easier to carry. I tried to get help from a woman 
who was inside one of the chans, but she was afraid and would not 
come out to help us. Then a boy came by and I told him not to be 
afraid. I told him we needed help skinning and butchering the 
ghoral. So the boy helped us and we took three legs on up into the 
mountains with us, leaving the rest for the people in the chans to 
divide among themselves." 

<P>"After walking for hours we arrived at Deodital. We arrived at 
the lake and cooked and ate the three legs. We also met a number 
of other people from the school up there. I guess they had come 
hiking to enjoy the view. Later we went hunting again -- in those 
days I did not even know the meaning of the word tired!" 

<P>"It was very cold up there. We were hunting <i>kastura</i> 
[musk deer]. We managed to kill one, but kastura are very small, 
and there were twenty of us altogether and not enough meat to go 
around. So this is what we did, we decided to tell everyone in the 
camp that we had shot a <i>langur</i> [monkey]! We butchered the 
musk deer out of sight and then brought [<i>++page 16  <b>Bal Kand 
/ The Book of Childhood</b></i>]   the meat back to camp. We 
cooked it and ate, and told everyone that we had decided to eat 
monkey meat because we were hungry. The coolies who were with us 
would not touch the stuff! There was an old man, however, who said 
to himself, `Now I know that Dil Das would never eat a monkey.' He 
knew what was going on. But when he took me aside and asked, I 
insisted that we were eating langur. I said it was a monkey and 
that he was welcome to help himself. When he asked how it was that 
I was able to eat the meat, I told him that it was just a matter 
of necessity, and that you have to do what you have to do. We 
bantered on like this for some time, and then he finally said, 
'No matter, I too will eat some monkey.' He figured it out, you see." 

<P>"Bahadur was our cook. His uncle lives there at the toll gate 
now, and he used to work at the school with Fleeting. Well, 
Bahadur had hung the butchered musk deer up in a tree and I told 
the men that they were all fools; if they would only go and smell 
the meat they would realize that it was not monkey. I told them to 
go and sniff the meat and judge for themselves, but no one would 
tell them outright that it was not a monkey we had shot!" 

<P>"In those days there was nothing but a small temple up at 
Deodital; nothing else .... No bungalow near the lake .... The fun 
we had back then is not to be had now. What a forest. But cars go 
right up there, you see; almost right to the lake." 

<P>* * *

<P>"One time the Smith boys, my uncle Abloo, and I went on a 
hiking trip. The bays were all very young then, probably not much 
older than Beeji; about twelve or thirteen. We were going up 
toward Kathling, the glacier behind Tehri, and Smith sahib and 
memsahib had asked me to look after their children:" 

<P>'Along the way we stopped and Abloo bought a basket of 
<i>cholu</i> fruit [small sour plums] from some kids for a couple 
of rupees. I told him not to, but he did anyway. He ate the whole 
thing and, just as I suspected, he got sick with cholera. We were 
on our way up to Gansali and stopped in a rest house at Ghanti 
along the way. We got as far as Ghanti by car, and planned to walk 
on from there. So the next day we started out. Up at Gansali now 
there is a bridge and a town, but back then there was nothing. We 
had to go all the way down the mountain to Ganga ji [the Ganga 
River], to find a place to make some tea." 

<P>"Well, we were walking up to Gansali and got as far as Sankhari 
when Abloo started to get very sick. I stayed back with him and 
told the Smith boys I would meet them on ahead at the pilgrim rest 
house. After I got [<i><b>Woodstock School</b> ++page 17</i>]  
Abloo settled down I went on. What else could I do? I gave him a 
tin of fruit to eat in case he got hungry. I tell you, that day 
was a bad one for me. I was supposed to look after the children 
but had to take care of my uncle. So I went on up the trail to 
catch up with the children. When we got up to Gansali we found 
that there was just a pilgrim's guest house, a mill, and a few tea 
shops -- nothing else. Even so, we got settled in. I made some 
<i>khichari</i>, fed the kids, and then told them that I had to go 
back down and take care of Abloo. I told them not to move until I 
got back. I had to travel at night and the distance and terrain 
was like from here to Rajpur, about ten kilometers up and down. 
Twenty, round trip." 

<P>"Now, I thought to myself that the place was very strange and 
unfamiliar, but that if I wanted to make it safely I would. I 
could. So I kept going and going until I came near to Sankhari. 
Near the village I saw that my uncle was coming along the path 
toward me and said to myself, Ah, he is not dead!' I was relieved. 
I had thought to myself on the way down that if he had died I 
would have just thrown his body into the Ganga and that would have 
been that. It took us a long time to reach one another, but when 
finally we met along the path I saw that he was crying. I told him 
not to worry; everything would be all right. I picked up his bags 
and started to carry them back up the path to Gansali, back to 
where I had left the boys." 

<P>"When we got there I asked some people to provide us with a 
coolie to carry our things on up to Gangi. I had friends up there 
and we could leave our loads with them and then go on up to 
Kathling, to the glacier. Well, a coolie was found, and I told him 
that I would give him food and tea as payment. He agreed, and we 
went on up. As we got higher and higher it began to get cold. All 
along I kept giving Abloo medicine and he improved somewhat. We 
got as far as Dhokari, where I found a friend of mine. I told him 
we would be going hunting further up, so he decided to come along. 
He had a muzzle loader and kept everything he needed in the collar 
of his woolen jacket; his powder, shot, and cotton -- 
everything." 

<P>"As we got further up, Abloo's health got worse again. Then my 
friend from Dhokari took out some medicine he kept in his collar 
and gave it to uncle. Soon he felt better. That night we found an 
overhanging rock and all of us climbed under it and fell asleep. 
In the morning we got up and made some tea. Then there was the 
question of food. What were we going to do? I told everyone to 
wait and that we would be able to get some where we were going. 
Now, the trail from there was all covered with snow but was marked 
by a path of stones which had been placed on top of the snow to 
show the way. We walked and walked until finally we got to the 
glacier. We tried to make some food there, but there was 
[<i>++page 18  <b>Bal Kand / The Book of Childhood</b></i>]  no 
wood to start a fire. All we had were some paraffin pellets, and 
with these we made some coffee. We ate some cookies, a little 
popcorn, and puffed oats and this served as our meal." 

<P>"After a short time we started back down to Gangi, but along 
the way Abloo's knees gave out and he could not walk. Even though 
I was carrying a load I had to carry him as well. There was 
nothing else to do. I put him on my shoulders and carried him. 
Now, if Ghanti had been as far away as Landour from here, about 
five kilometers, it would not have been a problem. But it was a 
long way. Ghanti was two or three days' walk away. I had my load 
and I had to carry my uncle. So we walked and walked. But then I 
realized that the children's school was going to reopen soon and 
that we had to hurry back. I told them we would have to walk at 
night as well. Finally we got back to where the bridge is now and 
I told everyone that I would go on and make arrangements for a 
car. This was after the second day and Abloo was feeling a little 
better. He was able to walk slowly. Even so, I told them all to 
wait for me there." 

<P>"I walked on to Ghanti and made arrangements for a bus. There 
were no cars. I bought six tickets and told the driver to wait for 
us, but that if we were late to wait only ten minutes before 
leaving. I went back quickly and we all made it back down to 
Ghanti in time." 

<P>"Now, I was very tired and when we got into the bus I told the 
Smith boys and Abloo to take the seats but to leave me the aisle. 
I had a bag with me which I put down as a pillow. I said, `You may 
put your feet on me. I don't care. Just let me go to sleep!' I lay 
down and went to sleep and didn't wake up until Agrakhala, on the 
road to Mussoorie beyond Tehri, but below Chamba, where there is a 
police station. I got off to buy some food and saw a policeman 
standing nearby. He turned out to be a friend of mine. He asked 
where I was coming from and I told him the whole story -- the 
children, the cold, the lack of food, and my uncle's sickness. He 
invited me in to have some tea. I said, 'Never mind the tea, but 
if you have anything which will relieve my tiredness I will take 
it.' I asked him for some liquor, you see. It was not easily 
available, and there was nobody else there who would be able to 
provide it. No sir! Now, had I been in Mussoorie or Dehra Dun I 
could have made arrangements, but not there. But I told my friend 
the policeman I was dead tired. So he said, `Sit, sit,' and gave 
the others tea. Then he took me aside and brought me into the 
police station. He brought out a bottle of kacchi, and he, another 
policeman, and I drank it together. I thanked him and then we went 
on our way" 

<P>"When we got to Dehra Dun I bought a quarter bottle of liquor 
but didn't drink it. I didn't eat anything right away, either. 
There was one man on the bus with us then who wouldn't eat any 
meat or drink any liquor. I told him he would die of hunger and of 
weakness if he did not. 

<br>[<i><b>Woodstock School</b> ++page 19]</i> 

<br> But all he ate were some <i>jalebis </i>(sweets). That was 
all. So I drank the liquor and ate some meat and rice. Then we 
started off on the road to Mussoorie, and by the time we got to 
Kulukhet, to the municipal toll gate, I was feeling very strong 
again. At Kulukhet I had many friends; they are our people there, 
you know, people from the hills. There are villages nearby and 
kacchi is easily available, you see. The Munsi there gave me a 
shot of liquor; you know him, the toll collector. Well, by the 
time we got back up to Mussoorie everything was fine. I was 
feeling good. So I took the children back home. I could have 
stayed, but I told the memsahib, Mrs. Smith, that I was very tired 
and would go straight back to the village." 

<P>"Three days later I came back up to the school and told both 
sahib and memsahib the whole story. They agreed that I had 
suffered greatly. It was only because I went along that the 
memsahib had agreed to let the children go, you see. If I had not 
gone along they would not have been allowed to go. And the 
children were all behind me as well. They were the ones who wanted 
me to go with them." 

<P>* * *

<P>"I had gone to Kulu, over in the mountains beyond Simla in 
Himachal, with Taylor sahib, his wife, and their children. They 
were on vacation from school. At that time there were military 
people in the valley, and so there were restaurants and places to 
buy meat. We, of course, wanted to go hunting, so we asked around 
about guns and ammunition. Now, back then I didn't know very much, 
but I was worried. You see, there were Buddhist lamas in the area, 
and I was worried about what might happen if they found out we 
were hunting. After all, the children were with us." 

<P>"Anyway, when I returned from Kulu I fell ill with a fever. At 
home my mother had made <i>dehi</i> [yogurt]. I was eager to eat 
some, but she told me not to as it would make my fever worse. Dehi 
is a cold thing, you see. I did not get better for a long time. I 
still had a fever, so I came up to the Landour Community Hospital 
to get a diagnosis. There was a doctor back then named Chapman, 
and I went to the hospital to be examined by him." 

<P>"I remember that he gave me as much tomato salad and dehi to 
eat as I wanted, as much as I wanted! This was in October and 
November. Then he told me I had tuberculosis and sent me off with 
a letter of explanation to the hospital in Ludhiana where I could 
receive intensive treatment. Dr. Fisch and Dr. Garst were there. I 
went with my father, but then told him to leave me and go on back 
as the expense of staying would be too great. I had to have 
injections and many other things. So I went to Ludhiana and stayed 
a long time. I stayed a long time in the Punjab."
