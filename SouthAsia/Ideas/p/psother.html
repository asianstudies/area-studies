<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><i>This essay reviews some of the
new literature on the transition to sustainable rural development (SRD). By considering
various accounts of environmental degradation, its links with poverty and
aspects of the agenda for SRD, the essay notes an ambiguity regarding the role
of the state, which is held, in this literature, as culpable for environmental
degradation, as well as given a substantial role, implicitly or explicitly; in
making the transition to SRD. This ambiguity is shown via an analysis of the
treatments written from historical, socio-cultural and political economy
perspectives, from which the essay draws the theme of state-class relations,
arguing a central position for these relations in SRD r agendas. The essay
concludes with an argument for a move to create a framework of analysis which
takes into account not only public policy but also political economy and
popular politics. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>A global agenda for sustainable
development has been in the making for at least the last quarter of a century.
In that time, despite significant successes, the degradation of the natural
environment has continued apace. The fact that ideas and their implementation
have lagged behind the process they aimed to arrest, if not to reverse, has
maintained a sense of urgency in the sustainable development literature, and
with good reason. High levels of rural poverty persist, and substantial numbers
(in some countries the majority) of people do not have secure access to food.
With populations increasing, and political trends not moving towards a quick
redistribution of wealth at the global and local levels, more rather than less
food needs to be produced. Rural development programmes in developing countries,
for a variety of reasons, have either failed, or had modest success, or, where
they were more successful, have run against their own limits. In many cases, it
is precisely where more food is needed more urgently that ecosystems seem at
their most fragile and thus less capable of meeting projected increases in
needs and demand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Long-standing systems of
sustainable agriculture, such as forest and bush fallow, wet rice cultivation
and integrated crop-animal husbandry, have failed to keep up with rapid increases
in human populations and incomes, Ruttan ('Sustainable Growth in Agricultural
Production: Poetry, Politics and Science', in Vosti and Reardon) points out. He
notes that the concern with sustainability is justified because developing
countries will demand more food until the middle of the next century, due to
growth in population and changing consumer demands and preferences. Future
sources of productivity growth are not apparent, and while techno-fixes such as
advances in molecular biology and genetic modification are advanced as
solutions, the truth of their claims is currently being fiercely contested. In
any case, the scarcity of phosphate fertilisers and fossil fuels will still
remain a constraint. De Haen ('Environmental Consequences of Agricultural
Growth in Developing Countries', in Vosti and Reardon) similarly argues that
co-evolutionary processes are no longer adequate to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>meet current and projected food
demands. In many contexts, there are little or no new lands to be brought under
agriculture. Extensive production systems in marginal lands have caused soil
erosion. Intensification of agriculture for productivity growth requires
improved seeds, fertilisers, irrigation, etc., but they cause loss of biodiversity
and salinisation. This poses a question puzzling many of the authors under
review: how to increase food production when current technologies have
diminishing returns and increasing environmental costs? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>There has been belated recognition
of the fact that environment degradation and poverty are entwined in a downward
spiral, each causing the other, and so sustainable rural development (SRD) has
become important from the points of view of equity and social justice as well.
As Buttel [1991] has pointed out, sustainability provides a disguised way of
keeping social justice on the political agenda in a neo-conservative or
neo-liberal world. Downing and Parry ('Global Climate Change: Implications for
the Links between Sustainability, Growth and Poverty Alleviation', in Vosti and
Reardon) point out that these issues acquire added urgency in the context of
global climate change, which is expected to bring about changes in average
rainfall, weather, extremes, and, via increases in carbon dioxide
concentrations, on plant growth. This would make agriculture less predictable
than it already is, and would likely exacerbate poverty. These trends and
predictions establish the need for ideas and agendas for SRD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>It is because SRD claims to be more
urgent and more fundamental an agenda than capitalist or socialist development
- green as distinct from blue or red - that this article evaluates them as
another agenda of transition altogether; asking if, indeed, the various agendas
for SRD suggested by the writers avoid 'older' divisions. In the first part, I
shall outline and analyse the agendas for SRD outlined by these authors, paying
special attention to the forms of structural, institutional and technological
changes they recommend, and the agents and interests they assume or argue will
bring about these transformations. In the second part, I shall review the two
historical monographs (Hill; Ninan) and a volume on state-society interactions
over the natural environment (Madsen), to evaluate the various programmemes for
SRD presented before. After discussing SRD from a public policy and then a
political economy approach, I consider SRD as a possible political project, and
suggest elements of a theoretical framework to analyse SRD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>assignation of agency in the
process, and an identification of those who won or lost in it. The writings
under review do not present a uniform narrative, though they do seem to share
elements of populist renditions of environmental history, which have been
identified by Greenough [1991: 2] as 'the standard environmental narrative' and
as 'the new traditionalist discourse' by Sinha <i>et al</i>. [ 1997]. Chief
among them is the argument of many of the writers that factors exogenous to the
immediate context of resource use, such as the state and 'the larger economy',
have primary responsibility for environmental degradation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>For example, Jodha, Shepherd and
Tutweiler and Bailey all hold the external state responsible for degradation.
For the Himalayan and Hindu Kush mountain areas Jodha ('Agricultural Growth and
Sustainability: Perspectives and Experiences from the Himalayas', in Vosti and
Reardon) argues that state interventions aimed to articulate the hills with
national economies through physical infrastructure, market links and legal and
administrative processes to extract 'mountain niche products' such as
hydropower, timber and tourism services, but were marked by poor planning.
Subsectors of the hill economy, such as irrigation, animal husbandry, forest
use and agriculture, are treated as distinct from each other in government
policy, but are inter-related on the ground. Plans emphasise food
self-sufficiency, though livelihoods there historically have depended upon a
more diverse portfolio of strategies including trade and transhumance. While
his observations are accurate in their own right, he does not ask why hills are
articulated with the national economies in the ways they are, what forms of
power and sets of interests underlie such policies and plans, and if factors
endogenous to the hills, such as population growth rates or structures of
ownership and control over the forests on class or gender lines have any
negative environmental outcomes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Shepherd's critique of the Green
Revolution (GR) as an example of the failure of state-led rural development, is
more political than Jodha's. He points out that the technical intervention of
the GR was done explicitly to avoid the politically more difficult course of
redistributive land reforms. When implemented, GR exacerbated geographical
inequalities between the few nations where it has been a success and those
where it has been an abject failure, and, even where it has been more
successful, between regions of success and failure. Shepherd argues that GR
might have enhanced productivity in the short run, but increased poverty and
inequality, and has had high environmental costs, ultimately failing on the
twin tests of equity and sustainability. This reading of the GR is partial at
best, since Shepherd does not consider the explicit justification for the GR,
such as achieving rapid national self-sufficiency in food at a time when world
food prices and availability were fluctuating wildly. Also, Shepherd moves from
state </p>

and Bailey's ('Agricultural Growth and Sustainability: Conditions for their
Compatibility in the Rainfed Production Systems of West Asia and North Africa',
in Vosti and Reardon) explanation for groundwater depletion, soil erosion and
degradation in the West Asia-North Africa (WANA) region. Since the 1950s and
60s, states have subsidised feed supply to stimulate agricultural and livestock
production to meet increased consumer demand fuelled by the oil boom, and at
the same time imported food and feed. However, by the time the oil and regional
labour markets ebbed in the 1980s, reducing government capacity to import food
and feed, the area had not become self-sufficient in either. In the livestock
sector, states now struggle to achieve a balance between feed supply and
livestock numbers. Grazing lands face stress as herders use trucks to transport
their herds, traversing in days the rangelands that earlier pastoralists took
seasons to do. With the division of communal pastures into private property
under land reforms, a tragedy of the commons like situation has been developing
in the context of a heightened competition for feed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>This narrative assigns to the
state almost total agency in policy formation, and indeed this may be the case
in those countries where the state is authoritarian and isolated from social
actors. But this notion of the state or of state-society relations is not made
explicit in the narrative. If the converse is the case, and social groups do
find access to policy formation, then the narrative would have to include an
analysis of social power. Such an analysis of social power is attempted by
Lindberg ('When the Wells Ran Dry: Tragedy of Collective Action among Farmers
in South India', in Madsen), who shows in the case of Tamil Nadu that
government price policies supported profligate water use by rich farmers
leading to groundwater depletion, and that rich farmers as a class were
collectively able to bear upon the government to maintain such policies for a considerable
period of time. It would have been useful to know patterns of groundwater use
by other rural classes, and if they too changed with the relations of these
classes with the state, but this question lies outside the scope of Lindberg's

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>institutions such as temples. Regarding common pool
resources (CPRs), they point correctly to two elements leading to degradation:
villagers do not have secure tenure over them, and institutional loans are
seldom available to villages to undertake regeneration work. Similarly, Chopra
and Rao ('Institutional and Technological Perspectives on the Links between
Agricultural Sustainability and Poverty: Illustrations from India', in Vosti
and Reardon) argue that resource depletion is the product of inappropriate
price policies and property rights regimes, and inappropriate incentives:
villagers do not participate in state reforestation schemes because they prefer
other species, or are sometimes fenced out from reforested areas, giving them
no incentives to participate in their regeneration. State initiated poverty
alleviation programmemes rarely have eco-restoration as an essential component.
Similarly, Pingali notes for South-east Asia that without secure long term
rights to land, farmers have no incentives to plant perennials or trees, or to
undertake soil conservation measures. In fact, they might have incentives to
take an opportunistic short-term view of land development. Uncontrolled access
to public forest lands also create degradation: loggers open up the forests,
followed by farmers. From this focus on institutions emerge a number of
important but unanswered questions. Whitaker <i>et al</i>.'s linking of land
reforms to degradation suggests that a core part of the Indian agenda for
equity and social justice might be incompatible with environmental
sustainability. Chopra and Rao correctly point out that state-led poverty
alleviation and ecological regeneration ignore 'villagers' priorities, but do
not address the sources of the priorities which are in fact reflected in state
policies. In South-east Asia, it is be important to know if farmers with more
secure tenures actually undertake conservation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A structure of perverse incentives at the level of
the national economy is held by Reardon and Vosti ('Poverty-Environment Links
in Rural Areas of Developing Countries', in Vosti and Reardon, eds.) as a cause
of deforestation in Brazil's Amazonia province, where new settlers and forest
capitalists have incentives to clear land, but not to invest in regeneration.
Cunha and Sawyer ('Agricultural Growth, Sustainability and Poverty Alleviation
in the Brazilian Amazon', in Vosti and Reardon) concur that incentives to
promote settlement favour overuse of resources. These policy failures combine
with market failures, such as an inadequate understanding and valuation of
resources, producing a speculative rush on resources. This attention on
incentives is important in its own right, but the question needs to be asked
why settlers were sent to Amazonia in the first place, with its limited
infrastructure, low soil productivity and lack of access, and what that says
about their position in relation to the state and other claimants to land. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is done more explicitly in Celis <i

Poverty Alleviation and Sustainability in the Dry Tropical Hillsides of Central
America: A Guatemalan Case Study', in Vosti and Reardon) of degradation on the
basis of the interaction of an ecosystem with political-economic systems. The
Guatemalan hills have more than double the population density of the lowlands,
and grow most of the maize and beans in the country. Migrants forced out by
expansion of plantations producing for export markets add to the population
stress in the hills to cause heavy soil erosion. These factors interact with
the class nature of the state: a highly skewed distribution of land forces the
poor to fragile lands, but land reforms have not happened despite decades of
revolutionary movements. Such an entrenched system of close relations between
the state, local and international capitalists, one can draw the implication,
works against SRD. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Some explanations of degradation point to factors
over which the state has had only limited control. For the African semi-arid
tropics, Webb and Coppock ('Prospects of Pastoralism in Semi-Arid Africa', in
Vosti and Reardon) argue that pastoralism as a system is being eroded due to
drought, population growth and territorial contraction, leading to a heightened
conflict over resources. Population has risen faster than livestock numbers,
which is constrained by forage availability, causing declines in per capita
livestock holdings. As pastures are over-grazed milk production is reduced, the
purchasing power of pastoralists deteriorates, and there is capital loss
through livestock mortality. Territorial contraction has been the result of
expansion of cropping, resulting in the loss of grazing lands. These factors
interact with state initiatives such as irrigation schemes: most of Africa's
irrigation schemes have been located in areas which provide dry season
pastures. Facing heightened resource competition, many groups now commonly use
dry season pastures so far reserved for use during droughts. This leaves them
vulnerable during droughts, causing higher and faster mortality of livestock.
In many cases grazing lands are going through formal enclosures. In this
narrative, processes driving degradation are only marginally state-led, and
pastoralist groups are only marginally in state control. In so far as
degradation has primarily endogenous reasons, however, it is important to
investigate if 'pastoralists' are homogenous groups and, if not, whether the
behaviour of some sub-groups accelerates this process. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>developed countries, which led to the tripling of
world real interest rates twice since 1945, falling and unstable relative farm
prices, and labour displacing technical progress are key causes of global
resource degradation. Developing countries are price takers for interest rates
and product takers for technology mixes. The high interest rates of the 1980s
increased resource degradation by worsening structures of investment,
production and consumption. The share of agriculture in government spending fell
from 8 per cent in 1979 to 4.5 per cent in 1988, thus weakening a major policy
lever to reduce rates of degradation. State capacity in developing countries
was further weakened by other policies set by exogenous agents that provide
incentives for resource-degrading activities and reduce the capacity of public
decision makers in developing countries from taking countervailing action. For
example, EU, American and Japanese farm policies stimulate overproduction,
subsidise huge stock overhangs which further push down price, and fund research
which leads ultimately to more overproduction. Also, OECD policies to cushion
their farmers from world price fluctuations destabilise world prices. AS a
result, when prices are temporarily high, developing country farmers
overproduce even at the risk of environmental degradation. Without heavy
changes in developed country policies, Lipton argues that all the policy
changes by developing countries would be in vain. The shift of focus to the
international political economic context of agriculture in developing countries
is a crucial one, and one can easily agree with Lipton's implicit point about
the power of global capitalism to reduce the capacity of states in developing
countries to carry out ecologically sound farm policies. But that set contains
countries that are articulated with the international economy in very different
ways. A further disaggregation based on region, types of goods, size and
geo-political status, levels of current technology, strength of the state and
the relation of agriculture to other sectors domestically, is necessary to get
a clearer picture. Also, states and ruling classes in developing countries have
no agency in Lipton's framework in how their economies are articulated with the
international economy. That is clearly not the case. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Also considering the international political economy
context of environmental degradation, Siamwalla ('The Relationship between
Trade and Environment, with Special Reference to Agriculture', in Vosti and Reardon)
claims that trade and environment have no necessary relationship, and then
shows how states make use of international policies to produce domestic
economic and environmental outcomes. His case study shows that Thailand's use
of EC pricing policies to export cassava for feed was a veritable rural
development policy, and had a profound impact on Thailand's forest. A very easy
crop to grow, cassava lifted many Thai peasants from poverty. Since the state's
property rights in forests were not properly enforced, the expansion of the
area under cassava absorbed population growth, but had the effect of
accelerating deforestation. The cassava boom came to an end in the 1980s, when
the limits of the arable were reached, and when EC set an upper limit on feed imports
from Thailand. Similarly, Spencer and Polson ('Agricultural Growth and
Sustainability: Conditions for their Compatibility in the Humid and Subhumid
Tropics of Africa', in Vosti and Reardon) show that in Cote d'Ivoire, the
development of export-oriented cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, plantains,
palm oil and rubber has expanded the area under cultivation, as efforts to
intensify production failed. This has caused deforestation, the gains from
which have been short-lived and modest. While these examples are similar in
that they both produced environmental degradation, it is notable that in the
Thai case, cassava production did have a positive impact on poverty
alleviation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The degradation of the natural environment, in these
essays, is thus attributed to (a) aspects of the international economy, namely
asymmetrical relations between developed and developing countries and
incentives and constraints this opens for developing country policy-makers and
farmers; (b) the intended and unintended consequences of past state-led
policies of accelerated economic growth, either directly or through the system
of incentives they unleashed; and (c) factors such as population growth and
density in interaction with local topography and eco-systemic specificities and
wider political economic forces. I would stress that while these explanations
are valid in some cases to some extent, a more comprehensive framework would
incorporate the agency of states and social classes in creating and maintaining
the articulations that produce environmental degradation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Poverty and the poor are of central concern to many
of the authors under review who draw links between environmental degradation
and poverty. Lipton ('Accelerated Resource Degradation by Agriculture in
Developing Countries? The Role of Population Change and Responses to It', in
Vosti and Reardon) argues that population growth rates outstrip food production
and, as labour surpluses are created, push down wages and food entitlements.
Trying to escape or at least postpone Malthusian hell, the poor migrate to
sparsely populated but environmentally fragile area, leading to their
degradation. Jodha (op. cit.) argues that environmental degradation in the
Himalayas and Hindukush makes it difficult to carry out fertility-regenerative
farming and increases the food deficit period between seasons, forcing
outmigration by the poor. Pingali ('Agriculture-Environment-Poverty
Interactions in the Southeast Asian Humid Tropics', in Vosti and Reardon) notes
that poverty in deforested areas of the Philippines is significantly higher
than the national average. Whitaker <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>et al</i>.
(op. cit.) likewise link decreasing per capita productivity of soil and water
in the Indian semi-arid tropics and the fact that rural incomes are a fourth of
the national average. Cunha and Sawyer (op. cit.) argue that policies such as
expansion of cultivation in the rainforest have made at best a modest and short
term contribution to poverty alleviation. It is to counter these trends that
SRD agendas claim simultaneously to be poverty alleviation programs. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The arguments above tend to see the poor in
isolation from the rest of rural society. The interplay between the poor and
the rural rich is raised in Chakraborty's ('Linkages between Income
Distribution and Environmental Degradation in Rural India', in Madsen.)
discussion of the relations between environmental degradation and income
distribution more generally. He posits a twofold relationship: first, he shows
that income distributions are affected because degradation affects the poor
more than the rich. Second, he shows that the rural rich are exposed to new
opportunities to generate profits through resource use. The rural rich's access
to resources has been enhanced by state policies, and they have been able to
benefit most from the privatisation of communal grazing lands, and from new
urban demands for milk and meat. Faced with reduced access to resources, the
poor put pressure on already fragile commons. Government subsidies have aimed
to encourage the rural poor to buy livestock and stimulate regional integration
of milk markets, but a shrinking fodder base has caused increased pressures on
grazing lands. Rich and poor in Chakraborty's scheme relate to each other in
rural resource economies through three key structural asymmetries. First, the
rich appropriate resources at the expense of the poor. Secondly, the rich are
relatively stronger positioned in various </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>markets. Finally, as a smaller and better connected
class, the rural rich have fewer obstacles to collective action. These
asymmetries combine to produce insecurity of property rights for the rural
poor. Their access to resources, or incentives to take a long view in their
use, are both limited as a result. Also, as resource use forms only a small
part of their portfolio of activities, minor degradation of the resource base
affects the rural rich less severely than the poor. There are other relevant
structural asymmetries, for example a unidirectional flow of externalities, in
which richer and more powerful actors can inflict such externalities on weaker
actors who cannot reciprocate the flow. Finally, there is asymmetry in terms of
monitoring and sanctioning resource overuse. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Chakraborty presents a complex analysis of the
relation between environmental degradation and poverty by focusing on aspects
of structural power. But 'rich' and 'poor' are still ill-defined categories,
and one would need to know how this intersects with other rural classes and
social groups, including caste and gender. Another implication of Chakraborty's
work, which I will consider later, is whether SRD agendas consider the range of
structural asymmetries that produce poverty and environmental degradation.
Also, Chakraborty does not tell us if political projects of reversing power
relations in the countryside are possible given that the poor are structurally
less able to organise collective action, and where already ongoing, if they have
had a positive environmental outcome. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A further attempt to disaggregate 'poverty' is by
Reardon and Vosti ('Poverty-Environment Links in Rural Areas of Developing
Countries', in Vosti and Reardon) who are dissatisfied with the exclusive
concern with welfare-oriented measures pervasive in the literature. They argue
that different types of poverty reflect the lack of specific assets, and
therefore have specific impact on the environment. Likewise, they advocate a
typology of environmental change, since each type would have a different
relationship with poverty. In this connection, they suggest that poverty
measurements accommodate the notion of 'conservation-investment poverty'. They
find welfare oriented measures of poverty inadequate, since households which
are not poor on these criteria might still be too poor to make conservation
investments. Second, welfare poverty looks at individuals or households, not
'communities' that, according to Reardon and Vosti are the ideal units to
undertake such investments. Further, they ask if poverty alleviation is
adequate to redress environmental problems. Reardon and Vosti advance a new
conceptual framework that includes categories of assets held by the rural poor,
important especially if there is limited substitutability of assets. While the
suggestion regarding typologies of environmental change and categories of
assets is an interesting one, especially from the point of view of making
targeted policy interventions, it </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is unlikely that this will reverse the structural
asymmetries raised by Chakraborty. The choice of household as the unit for the
measurement of conservation-investment poverty ignores decades of gender-based
arguments that question the utility of that notion. If an aggregate like a
household or a community is to be the unit of measurement, would it not be as
useful to think of regions and countries too as being 'conservation-investment'
poor? Finally it is not clear if overcoming conservation-investment poverty is
a sufficient or even a necessary condition for achieving SRD. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cunha and Sawyer (op. cit) present an explanation of
the relations between regional poverty and environmental degradation. They
point out that Brazil's Amazonia province is disadvantaged in the context of
the national economy in terms of its inappropriate technology, distance from
markets, inelastic supply of inputs, and absence of external economies. Farmers
here have trouble attracting wage workers, as only those settle in the Amazon
who are very poor and face a critical shortage of alternatives. Sustainability
enhancing technologies are unavailable, and since it is not regionally
competitive, Amazonia is a low priority for research. Since it is land surplus,
there are few incentives for land-saving innovations or natural resource
conservation. Also, in the current scenario of state shrinkage, it is unlikely
that the government will stimulate demand for land saving technologies when
there is no demand for them. This study puts new questions to the notion of
conservation investment poverty: is the concept equipped to deal with the issue
of regional poverty? Even if it were able to measure it, it is not clear how
useful it would be given that Amazonia's poverty is a result of its
articulation with Brazilian political economy. The concept does not tell us how
new investment in conservation could be brought into a region with low demand
and low state capacity and interest to stimulate it. </p>

collectively argue that environmental degradation occurs due primarily to
external agents such as the state or the larger economy, that such degradation
exacerbates poverty and is in turn exacerbated by it. Since SRD agendas claim

first outline some of the agendas under review and then evaluate them on these

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:.25in'>Let us consider some
definitions. In Vosti and Reardon's ('Introduction: The Critical Triangle of
Links among Sustainability, Growth and Poverty Alleviation', in Vosti and
Reardon) rather minimal definition, SRD implies compatibility between
agricultural growth and conservation of the farmland natural resource base and of
the commons; issues of redistribution or equity are not central. For Jodha (op.
cit.), sustainability is the ability of a system to maintain a level of
performance, say for output, over time and to enhance the same if necessary:
the concern again is first with the productive capacity of the ecosystem.
Concerned with pastoral systems, Webb and Coppock (op. cit.) take
sustainability to mean both promoting food security and long term capacity of
the resource base to support pastoral activities, the first concern justified
on equity grounds, the second less so in light of their own review of the
relations between pastoralism and degradation. Chopra and Rao's definition,
that of successful management of agriculture to simultaneously meet changing
human needs, reduce poverty and maintain or enhance the quality of the
environment, correctly puts equal emphasis on growth, redistribution and
ecological sustainability. The most extensive definition of SRD is Shepherd's,
for whom, unlike the 'steady-state' arguments of previous decades, the new SRD
agenda is not about zero growth, but about the quality of growth, implying
ecologically sound, economically viable, socially just, humane and adaptable
agricultural systems, based on low external inputs, indigenous knowledge and
management, and using resource conserving and enhancing technologies. As this
sample of definitions indicates, at their core SRD definitions are based on a
balance between the productive and regenerative capacity of resources, to be
achieved to meet equity-oriented goals such as food security and poverty
alleviation, using participatory institutional and appropriate technological
innovations. It should be noted that there is no 'natural affinity' between
these goals; if anything, there are potential conflicts between one element and
the next. How do SRD agendas propose to address them? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd is the most favourably disposed of the
authors under review to key elements of the new international policy agenda,
such as structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) and trade liberalisation. He
argues that SAPS have much to offer rural societies and economies by reducing
state intervention which tie them in red tape, tax them excessively without
providing enough in return, and are 'urban biased'. SAPS for him can reduce the
power of elites who use the state to meet specific ends. He sees currency
devaluation and subsidies reduction creating better prices for third world farm
exports and making technology and equipment import more expensive, thus
favouring employment and sustainability. Shepherd argues </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that the post-Uruguay round trade scenario should
provide lucrative incentives to move towards organic agriculture for
environmentally aware farmers in developing countries that export agricultural
goods, though he admits that the only winners yet are producers of goods so far
suffering from high tariffs. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is curious that Shepherd holds faith in these
elements of the new policy agenda when he himself presents clear evidence
against such optimistic prognostications. He reviews the few full studies of
the environmental impact of SAPS which indicate that they encourage
environmental degradation directly and indirectly. They tend to increase
uncertainty for farmers, few of whom can change fixed factors at short notice,
say when subsidies are withdrawn. Also, export oriented policy changes benefit
agriculture only when export markets exist, and producers have some control
over prices, which is not the case currently. Instead of being alleviated,
poverty is exacerbated by reduced government expenditure in the short and
medium term, forcing the poor to environment degrading livelihood practices.
Shepherd is aware that the poor lack the endowments to make use of the
opportunities these changes open, and recommends that new strategies include
temporary safety nets and address the root causes of food insecurity, as well
as plans to remove distortions in the public sector, encourage the private
sector, diversify the agricultural base, and reduce dependence on a small
number of export products. One problem with this persistence with advocacy of
the new agenda in the face of evidence to the contrary is that it contains no
direct means of achieving the goals which have been placed at the centre of his
definition of SRD. Additionally, there is no consideration of the negative
impact of state shrinkage on achieving SRD's objectives. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd's other argument that international policy
requirements such as a reduction in subsidies will act as a disincentive to the
use of chemical inputs and fuel, and thus encourage sustainable agriculture, is
contradicted by Malton and Adesina ('Agricultural Growth and Sustainability:
Prospects for Semi-Arid West Africa', in Vosti and Reardon) who argue that the
decline in the use of chemical inputs can have short-term negative effects on
productivity and poverty. In the west African semi-arid tropics, the soil would
likely have enhanced productivity with increased fertiliser use, since it chiefly
suffers from phosphorous and nitrogen deficiencies. However, market forces have
increased prices just as SAPS have led to cuts in subsidies. Malton and Adesina
recommend an alternative fertiliser management practice, cheaper, more
efficient and economically sustainable, but the policy environment seems to
work against it since it takes the state out of precisely those sorts of roles.
The question of the political basis for such a change in the role of the state
will be taken up at the end of this essay. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>No uniform combination of technological and
institutional innovations has been offered by the authors under review, though
they form the larger part of the recommendations for achieving SRD. Again,
Shepherd provides the most comprehensive list of requirements these innovations
must meet: they must improve productivity of labour, capital and land without
degrading the natural resource base. These must be adaptable by small farmers,
not requiring radical changes by them, nor heavy initial investments. To avoid
the failure of past attempts at technology transfers, new technologies must be
developed with the maximum participation by farmers, including women. Let us
review some cases of such innovations and then consider some problems in
achieving these goals. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Interestingly, the move towards integrated pest
management (IPM) currently finding favour in development circles, would not
meet Shepherd's criteria for SRD. IPM is advanced as a panacea for many of the
problems associated with chemical inputs, but as Shepherd correctly notes it
requires a radical redesign of the entire farming system. Farmers need to be
able to predict the outbreak of diseases, consider pest management in making
other on-farm decisions, develop a better understanding of pest ecology and
population dynamics, as well as be able to calculate when to switch to chemical
controls in the event of continued damage. This signals potential problems in
the adoption of technological change. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The preference for institutions under 'local'
control is strong in many of the recommended innovations. Malton and Adesina
suggest new institutions such as the smaller scale village level irrigation
systems in the Sahel with more responsibilites to individuals and farmer
groups. While this move from larger to smaller scale systems is laudable from
the perspective of participation, the authors do not mention how local groups
coordinated with each other in water use, and whether the enabling conditions
prevailing in the Sahel are similar to those elsewhere. Webb and Coppock note
that after many decades when Hardin's 'tragedy of the commons' held sway over
policy in Zimbabwe, there is new emphasis on the creation of herders'
associations and grazing groups that regulate stock trees, rotational grazing
and overall rangeland use. An account of how such collective action came about
is missing in these case studies, and the question of agency is not explicitly
addressed. </p>

allocates forest land to shifting cultivators to clear, and gives them
tenancies or leases to the land. The Integrated Social Forestry Programme gives
cultivators 25-year stewardship contracts. These relatively secure tenures
provide incentives to be careful and prudent in resource use, but are possible
only where other more lucrative land uses are absent, for example in marginal
lands and upper slopes, and cover only 2.5 per cent of Philippine uplands so
far. In some cases, contract holders have not been able to assert their new rights
against absentee landlords, and in others, individual rights have not been
enough to reverse degradation when collective action is needed for it. Pingali
provides another example from southern Luzon, where a shift from annual
cropping of uplands to agroforestry, making use of markets for forest products,
resulted in reversal of environmental degradation. It is to be noted that these
innovations are limited by the power of other claimants of the resource, and by
the articulation of the local with larger economies. Pingali, unfortunately,
does not discuss the political process whereby the state became involved in
these innovations. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For drought prone areas, Tutweiler and Bailey
('Agricultural Growth and Sustainability: Conditions for their Compatibility in
the Rainfed Production Systems of West Asia and North Africa', in Vosti and
Reardon) recommend drought tolerant pasture or forage legumes, and a rational
rangeland use policy including price incentives for sustainable land use,
accompanied by a regulatory policy and the creation of cooperatives and other
appropriate organisations. Clearly, the implicit agency here is that of the
state: in providing incentives, monitoring use and organising collective
action. The recommendation to grow low-stress multiple use crops comes against
other problems. Whitaker <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>et al</i>
suggest traditional subsistence crops including so called 'coarse' grains and
legumes for the Indian semi-arid tropics, since they require little investment,
resist stress, fit with intercropping systems, and provide more fodder. A chief
barrier to increased productivity of these crops has been that farmers grow
them in low-potential land, keeping overall yields down, reserving the best
lands for marketable high value crops. For farmers to devote better land to
these crops, a change would have to take place in the valuation of various
crops, requiring a change in which markets for various crops operate. The
authors do not make clear how such changes can come about in the rural economy.

For South Asia's hill areas, he calls for a diversification and intensification
of agriculture, together with an identification of comparative advantages and
the formation of lead sectors, the provision of R&amp;D, infrastructure and
marketing services, the promotion of activities that complemented lead
activities, and planning that took local specificities into consideration. He
finally suggests the promotion of long term sustainability via biomass
productivity increases, resource regeneration and agribusiness. Jodha's
explanation of degradation is largely based on exogenous factors, and the
sources of innovation, though not specified, are in all likelihood also
exogenous. It is not specified how these initiatives would avoid the problems

These include pest-resistant beans, erosion control methods such as straw
barriers, contour barriers of sorghum and sugarcane and stone contour walls,
and in-ground silos and forage cones that store fodder for longer. It needs to
be pointed out that the chief constraint is endogenous: these innovations
require labour, while peasants tend to migrate in the low agricultural season
to earn wages in coffee and sugarcane harvesting. This raises a paradoxical
point: labour utilising technological innovation would work better where there
is yearlong secure access to employment, and are limited in areas of high
levels of poverty. This indicates a limit to the agency of 'the poor' in making
the most of new technologies. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A further constraint to sustainable enhancement of
productivity, as Whitaker <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>et al</i>
argue, is the poor understanding of agricultural systems so far by researchers
rind policy makers. Ruttan calls for more knowledge regarding the role of
technology in increasing substitutability between natural resources and between
them and reproducible capital. Pingali also stresses the role of knowledge in
SRD, especially since the impact of productivity enhancing technologies such as
HYV seeds has reached a plateau. None of the writers specifies how this
knowledge will be collected and by whom. If the recent history of agricultural
knowledge is any indication, it is being collected increasingly for private and
corporate interests and being patented. Indeed it is doubtful if public
institutions have the capacity to generate such knowledge in current conditions
of budget constraints and state shrinkage. </p>

Shepherd sees signs of a paradigm shift that would enable the transition to
SRD. This new paradigm, he argues, is not universalistic but more
experience-centered, </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>based on respect for cultural pluralism and
ecological sustainability. One sign of the new paradigm he sees is the
influence of rational-choice based new institutionalist approach to resource
use, which according to him is progressive in its support for local and popular
institutions, and in recognising the limits of government and external actions.
This is curious given the theory of universal rationality underlying the
approach. It would likewise be hard to agree with his claim that the
'industrial approach' to technological development has been replaced by an
organic/holistic approach with sustainable development replacing profit as the
implicit objective, and that centralised resource control is being replaced by
local community control, in light of the move towards capitalist agriculture in
many developing countries and concentration of holdings of land and other
assets. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another sign of the shift that Shepherd sees is the
global thinking about agriculture, which he argues is now more open to
non-economic social sciences which are more sensitive to gender, indigenous
knowledge, and alternative technologies. Likewise he sees moves in
institutional innovation which have become more open to local, indigenous and
participatory methods to meet new criteria of effectiveness, efficiency,
equity, and women's empowerment, and in new institutions which he sees emerging
to encourage farmers, farm workers, consumer and other interest groups to join
the policy debates on sustainable agriculture. Again, while there might be some
empirical support for his optimism here, there is at least as much reason for
scepticism. Recall that in both the McLibel case and in the more recent
'farmers' caravan', legal and extra-legal restrictions prevented a free
discussion of world food politics even in liberal Britain. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd sees signs of the paradigm shift in the
transformation of the 'development project' itself. Concerned with control and
the removal of uncertainty, the 'projectisation' of development worked against
local institution building, with its avoidance of local influence,
decentralisation, participation and empowerment. Official approaches to
development now routinely use logical framework analyses and participatory
rural appraisal, and incorporate socio-cultural, environmental and political
analyses. This, to Shepherd, indicates a willingness to admit uncertainties in
official development thinking. Likewise the 'mixed scanning' approach denies
that there is any fixed project cycle, and asserts that activities can happen
at any time in the process without necessarily following the sequence normally
implied. Signs that a shift is taking place at the level of international
institutions are evident to Shepherd in the FAO's thinking on farming systems,
which considers the interdependencies between the components both within and
outside the control of household members; identifies farming system zones; and,
within them, groups of households which share </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sufficient characteristics and interests to work
together. While it is true that changes have taken place in development
thinking and practice and have made them more inclusive, it is not yet the case
that power relations between developers and 'participants' have been reversed.
Also, since these changes require more participation and thus more time on the
part of the poor, they make demands on time they could spend on other
livelihood activities. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Further signs of paradigm shift for Shepherd are
moves towards decentralised decision-making and common-purpose organisation
such as joint forest management. He cites the example of Mali, where farmers
have access to public research bodies. However, it is not clear if
decentralisation and 'community' level bodies change or replicate already
existing inequalities within the groups. In many cases, as for example in
Aase's study of north Pakistan ('The Use of Metaphor in Himalayan Resource
Management', in Madsen), exclusion and domination persists under the name of
traditional community organisations, which are sometimes used by dominant
groups in villages to effectively privatise the commons. Water is a scarce
commodity there and those deemed earlier settlers claim rights over it to the
exclusion of newer settlers. In these situations, Shepherd suggests that
development workers, the 'new professionals', fight for the rights of the
commoners, if necessary by taking them through the legal system. Shepherd's
framework, where endogenous actors first undertake collective action and turn
to new professionals if need be, closely mirrors the explanations of new
institutionalists and their reliance on 'the political entrepreneur' as an
external facilitator of collective action, and is thus subject to a similar set
of questions. Who are the new professionals? What is their relation with
resource users? What are their motivations in taking these risks? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd is confident of the poverty alleviating
prospects of the new SRD agenda. Structural adjustment policies, he claims,
will reduce poverty by creating the right policy environment, but he does not
specify the direct links between SAPs and employment creation, nor does he
discuss any evidence of this relationship. Likewise, his claim that sustainable
agriculture would alleviate poverty because a greater share of the income will
accrue to labour, and more resources used as common property with equity
considerations does not specify any mechanisms through which the gains from
sustainable agriculture would be redistributed. Would it, for example, be the
same in countries where modes of extra-economic coercion, including the state,
are used to suppress labour mobilisations for higher wages? The same criticism
is applicable to his argument that nonagricultural employment in villages and
small towns, more possible under the new agenda, will push up agricultural
wages: it is not clear why the new </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>agenda has more promise to generate non-farm
employment, nor why that most political of contexts, the struggle for wages,
would be suddenly depoliticised in it. He has more grounds to support his
enthusiasm for 'white revolutions', accelerated cooperative dairy production,
which push up rural incomes, but counsels care to avoid crop-fodder
competitions, use crop residues more optimally, and maintain draught power
stock. Again, it is not clear under what conditions livestock holders will meet
these criteria: the evidence, for example, in Tutweiler and Bailey (see above)
has been that the balance between livestock and feed supply is very hard to
maintain, and potentially can cause overgrazing. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd's concern for the fate of the world's
genetic resources is at odds with his enthusiasm for the new international
policy agenda. He recognises that genetic diversity is fast coming under the
control of TNCs and that the International Board of Plant Genetic Resources
reflects the priorities of rich countries, which differ from those of
developing countries. The Convention on Bio-Diversity legitimised the process
of gene patenting for the future, but has not resolved the issue of the status
of already existing genetic material; it also allows private and corporate
ownership of patents but not state or community ownership of them. Arguably,
this peculiarity in the ownership of genetic material and intellectual property
rights associated with them can severely exacerbate already existing
asymmetries in the global system. The capacity of the state to protect
biodiversity, as Herring points out ('Nature, State and Market: Implementing
International Regimes in India', in Madsen), is weak even when the state is
committed to it and there is an enabling international policy climate. One
could argue that it is weaker still when international agencies are putting
pressure on states to contract TNCs to run gene banks. Faced with what has been
termed 'biopiracy', Shepherd can only suggest promotion of seed exchanges to
encourage gene sharing. In treating the politics of genetic resources as
separate from the new policy agenda, Shepherd misses the larger point: that
patenting of genetic material and indigenous knowledge is in fact integral for
global capitalist agriculture and is facilitated by new trade and intellectual
property rights regimes. If anything, the signs are of a transfer of rights and
profits from developing to developed countries, and there is little evidence
that this will alleviate poverty. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The agendas for SRD listed above mostly make policy
recommendations for institutional and technological changes without an explicit
assignation of agency, a problem I shall address in the conclusion. For now, it
is important to note an important contradiction in the position ascribed to the
state, seen so far as complicit in, if not directly responsible for
environmental degradation. It is for this reason that Shepherd lauds SAP
induced state shrinkage, and for his claim that it opens the space for private </p>

initiatives and reducing the basis of power of dominant classes and groups.
While there is no evidence to support the argument that state shrinkage
empowers weaker social groups, it is possible that shrinkage in public
expenditure has increased incidence of poverty while the new policy agenda
holds no guarantees for poverty alleviation in the long run. Besides, many
parts of the new SRD agendas - research and development, provision of credit
for conservation, secure tenancies and the imposition and collection of land
taxes, the control over inter-regional flow of environmental externalities
require more rather than less state intervention. A more comprehensive and nuanced
understanding of the state is necessary. In the next section I analyse the ways
in which states, classes and communities historically have interacted over
resource use. That leads to a discussion of SRD as a possible political
project. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have raised the issue of political economic
constraints on public policy, referring mainly to the ways in which relations
between classes, and between them and the state, act to produce environmental
degradation and to thwart the implementation of recommendations for
technological and institutional innovations. As noted above, while narratives
of decline are often state-centric, many SRD agendas still require a
considerable role for the state. The question this raises is: why should the
state, so far an agent of degradation, now become a handmaiden to SRD? To
address this issue of changes in the nature of the state and in state
interests, I now put the prospects of future transitions against the evidence of
past histories. I will specifically address the ways in which state-class
relations affected resource use in the cases of South Asia and Japan which are
explicitly dealt with in Ninan, Hill and Madsen. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In his excellent study of colonial Purnia district
in north India, Hill suggests that the subordination and transformation of
nature and the instituting of private property were key ideological
underpinnings of the colonial state, and, through the system of permanent
settlements, a key source of revenue as well. The chief problem for the state
in Purnia stemmed from its location on the Kosi river, known to be an erratic,
violently flooding, meandering river, causing huge instability in agriculture:
in a hundred years, the river shifted course a total of 73 kilometres, and not
in any one direction. The state attempted to survey the river and riparian land

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>policies to maximise welfare and revenues. Settling
the Kosi area was a problem, since frequent flooding on the one hand created <i>diara</i>,
temporary or new land, and, on the other, also carried sand on cultivable land.
In this dismal place, another problem was to maintain a labour supply for
agriculture, involving the formulation of suitable immigration policies as
well. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Frustrated by the river, the state also failed to
intervene decisively in local class relations. <i>Zamindars</i>, landlords
recognised in permanent revenue settlements, had responded to revenue demands
by increasing rents and frequently deployed physically coercive means on
tenants for collecting their dues. They made use of ecological and
institutional uncertainties to extract more rent: a common ploy was to keep
tenants under uncertainty by delaying the renewal of leases. State legislation
could afford no protection to tenants as long as the riparian lands remained
unsurveyed. Despite its intentions, the Bengal Alluvion and Diluvion Act of
1847, while providing abatements to those whose lands were covered by flood
sand, made no provision for those whose lands were washed away. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hill notes that this disease, swamp and wildlife
infested land was a 'punishment posting' for the bureaucracy, which was
therefore staffed by corrupt and inept officers. Since most administrators
wanted quickly to be posted out of there, there was little continuity in the
local state which, Hill points out, was never more than a conspicuous presence.
Few in local administration had knowledge of the local conditions, and their
ineptitude and ignorance was used productively by those with local power to
maintain and extend their control over the peasantry. Rampant corruption in the
local state, trans-border crime, and Purnia's involvement in the political
tussles taking place in Nepal further reduced state capacity. When attempts
were made to extend control, such as the Anglo-Nepal war of 1812, local
landlords were not supportive of the colonialists. In fact, Gurkhas were able
to cross into Purnia, and cut and carry standing crops, dealing a heavy blow
both to British morale and to revenue. Moreover, since many dacoits and
landlords had a symbiotic relationship, the latter did little to assist the
local state in their capture. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The colonial state, in Hill's account, also had incomplete
control over agrarian class relations, and was unable to rupture the
exploitative relations landlords had with their tenants and labourers.
Landlords seldom lived up to their responsibilities to the state of clearing
jungle land and eradicating wild animals to promote cultivation. State efforts
to get more lands cleared for cultivation, for example by giving out land
tracts to invalids from the army failed. Invalids could not work the land which
was repossessed, then auctioned by district administration, mostly to absentee
landlords. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>since occupancy of that duration was likely to be
disrupted by the annually flooding Kosi. The occupancy requirements of the Act
led to situations where tenants, hopeful of secure tenures, paid rent on lands
that had been submerged. Also, since the Act required tenants to pay whatever
rent had been agreed upon, it gave landlords incentives for rack renting.
Revenue officers were to assume that rent was fair until proven otherwise, a
difficult task given the abject forms of subordination to which tenants were
subjected. Landlords were also able to use the police for their own purposes.
Hill notes that none except 'bad characters' wanted to become a policeman.
Village watchmen were usually lower caste, and often under the complete control
of local landlords. Since landlords ruled through a complex network of
intermediaries, these individuals too were able to create their own pockets of
power and wealth, even more so when landlords began spending more time away
from Purnia. The emerging independent class of middlemen was a further obstacle
to plans for revenue and administrative control. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Given the problem of migration and therefore of
labour availability, specific low rent forms of tenure were used in Purnia to
encourage the clearing and settlement of new lands. However, once the lands had
been settled, and especially if such land was in the control of intermediaries,
then new rents would also be added on. From the mostly Santhal settlers,
fleeing dispossession of their land in South Bihar and the Santhal Parganas
these tenures were the only way they could have access to land. Indeed,
desperate for land, Santhals would sometimes pay landlords for a chance to
clear the land, hoping for occupancy rights. Santhals became the tenants at
will or landless labourers of Purnia agriculture, at best retaining no more
than 50% of their production. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another class of cultivators, indigo planters, had
tremendous power owing to their interactions with the state. Perhaps among the
few British to know the district well, and sometimes able to get their
daughters married to colonial officers, they used the state to consolidate
their informal access to state power. This also provided them with protection
for the <i>zirat</i> system, which involved producing exclusively for the
factory, and for contracts in which they offered tenants seeds and tools for
planting indigo, which then could not be sold on the open market. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Hill does not set out to address the impact of state
failure and class relations on the environment in Purnia, but his narrative
does raise some important questions for the SRD agenda which, among other
things, calls for state shrinkage, equity, tenancy reforms and community
control. Here we find that a state with minimal capacity strengthened the power
of dominant classes over land and labour rather than weakened it, as predicted
by Shepherd. Despite its stated intentions, the state failed to alleviate the

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of poor tenants, landless and migrant labourers
through legislation. The sort of community control one sees in Purnia was exploitative
in every way, and can hardly find a place in an SRD agenda. Even when not
pursuing some collective class interest, landowners' individual strategies to
maximise power, rents and landholdings frustrated the state absolutely. A major
gap in Hill's study is his neglect of class relations on the river itself.
Also, while keeping in mind that it is a monograph, there are no indications if
Hill's conclusions are generalisable to other places in colonial India, or are
peculiar to Punia alone. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gilmartin ('The Irrigating Public: The State and
Local Management in Colonial Irrigation', in Madsen) provides another example
of limited state control over resources in colonial India, in the case of
irrigation channels in the Punjab. Concerned with recording already existing
rights rather than creating new ones, the state wanted to revive the
institutions through which users seasonally cleaned small inundation channels,
and mobilised labour required to maintain the larger systems, and if possible
to keep their operation in 'public' (though not yet state) control. However, a
constant problem was that powerful users claimed extensive rights based on
precedence. In the Shah Nahr, upper irrigators monopolised the water supply.
The state intervened, and diluted many rights of share holders, recording them
instead as forms of customary usage. Using the pretext of 'community control',
the state approved of unpaid labour to clear some canals, even though it was
often mobilised by large share holders using their power in local canal <i>panchayats</i>
(decision-making bodies) to coerce their tenants and labourers. Ultimately,
realising that this way of implementing 'public control' basically gave a free
hand to powerful resource users, a state more capable than in Purnia was able
to abolish the system altogether. This variation in state capacity between
Purnia and north Indian irrigation systems points to another lesson for SRD,
namely that success of state interventions such as tenancy reforms depends
largely on the social articulations of the local state: while the state in
Purnia was never able to control locally dominant classes, in Punjab it was
able to implement policies that went against the interests of the large
landowners. </p>

upon its forests and wildlife with alacrity. Its rapid conversion of forests
and wildlife into cash, seen as amoral selfishness, triggered accelerated use
by others. The current state, and specially the Forest Department, is seen as
having a voracious appetite for trees, and is held responsible for
environmental degradation. Gold's account portrays the state under a ruler
popularly seen as eccentric as able to conserve and protect the natural
environment, but neglects to incorporate a fuller analysis of state interests
in nature and its relations with various social groups. It also shows the
compatibility between feudal state power and conservation, raising the question

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Aase (op. cit.) provides an example of the way in
which rural resource users invoke the memory of state authority to create new
property rights in a Sai village located in Shinaiki, in the acephalous area in
north Pakistan. In the absence of centralised political authority, village
councils have effective power. Though under the nominal control of the Dogra
kings of Kashmir, this region became exposed to the external state only with
the opening of the Karakoram highway in 1978 and the construction of
hydro-electric power plants. Aase shows how a history of domination becomes
productive of a new kind of property. Even though an area opened to cultivation
as a result of dam building was closer to one village, another village further
away was adjudged to have a better claim to it since it fell within its
porterage responsibilities under Dogra rule. This is important to remember in
the context of calls for changing property rights: their legitimacy may be
located in historical precedence rather than any principle of sustainability of
equity. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gooch ('A Community Management Plan: The Van Gujjars

reducing the access of the rural poor to resources under the agendas of
sustainability and conservation in her study of the Rajaji wildlife reserve in
northern India. Official plans classified <i>van gujjars</i>, transhumant herders,
as outsiders and restricted their access to the reserve, thus disrupting their
livelihood strategies. State officials saw <i>gujjars</i> as having once lived
in harmony with nature, but having recently turned into agents of deforestation
and destruction of wildlife. According to the forest department, this is
because they have grown in numbers and have stopped migrating, and their best
option would be rehabilitation by the government. There are no symptoms in this
recent example of any paradigm shift: the state continues to see the poor as an
obstacle to conservation and wants to keep them out. </p>

caused massive ground water depletion in the state. When the state tried to put
an end to the subsidies and to collect arrears, a militant Tamil Farmers'
movement, speaking mostly for the beneficiaries of state agricultural
development policies, became an important actor. The state unleashed
repression, followed by disconnection of electrical supply from non-paying
farmers. Apart from these direct assaults, the AIADMK promised lower rates and
concessions for small farmers. The farmers' movement was split along class
lines and therefore weakened. Nevertheless, it was successful in first lowering
the electricity rates and later in getting it for free. While the explanation
of groundwater depletion is tied to the relations between the state and rich
farmers, Lindberg does not address the issue of changes in water use as state
actors made new alliances with other agrarian classes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Knudsen ('Deforestation and Entrepreneurship in the

states have over the natural environment, pointing out that the fines for
forest offences listed in Pakistan's forestry legislation are too low to be a
deterrent. Working plans set harvesting targets which are too high, resulting
in low regeneration. Even <i>guzara</i> forests which are sometimes listed as
communal are only under the nominal control of the community. Crude felling
methods which cause considerable collateral damage are tolerated. Instead of
doing away with forest contracts as a system, the state replaced contractors
with the Forest Development Corporation, which continued to sublease to
contractors. Knudsen does not specify if, at the core of deforestation, it is
the state's lack of technical knowledge or of capacity, or whether contractors
are part of the class basis of the state, and therefore can flout rules with
impunity regardless of environmental outcomes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>These studies of state-society interactions in South
Asia show that the local capacity of the state varies in terms of control of
resources. While in Gold's case this variation is explained by personal

explanation of differing state control over nature lies in varying state
relations with classes and other social groups. It is thus crucial for SRD

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>landowners lifelong usufruct but no transfer rights.
New rights were created in the twelvfth century for those who opened up
woodland, which later developed into hereditary rights. Facing low land
availability, the state encouraged land reclamation, giving ownership rights to
those who reclaimed it. These rights of the state to forests were balanced with
a sense of prudence in forest use. From the eghth century onwards, the state
passed decrees against overuse of timber, in some cases to protect water
sources. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Forests were also a direct source of state revenue.
Taxes were charged on village and private forests, and an officer appointed
explicitly for this purpose. The multiple uses of the forests themselves made
more revenue available: there were taxes on collecting firewood, fodder, green
manure and timber, plus for making charcoal. State collection of revenue from
rice cultivation also had an impact on forest use, through the expansion of the
arable by felling forests, the use of <i>sugi</i> wood in terracing, and the
use of green manures. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Increasing warfare in the late Tokugawa period
pushed up the demand for metals and metallurgy, requiring timber to fire the
smelters. Fuelwood and charcoal were also required for the production of sea
salt. The growing importance of forests was matched by increasing concern for
them, and forest overseers were appointed. This concern with timber prompted
the state to extend its power and control over river navigation to regulate the
timber trade. To control the supply of lumber, the state initiated regulation
of lumber markets, requiring traders to obtain contracts and authorisation. In
forests where logging was permitted, new restrictions were placed on the
quantum of cutting, as well as on species mix, with permission required for the
felling of key trees. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Feudal governments also controlled local village
forests, closing access to parts of them for regeneration of certain species.
They required village communities to report on forest stocks on the basis of
which to make forest policy. There were strict penalties for non-compliance:
one village in an area was made to monitor forest use by others, and was paid
for this. If the village failed, they had to pay for the damage, sometimes
twice the market rate for that sort of timber. Sometimes, death penalties were
imposed on forest offenders. Apart from these institutional changes, two key
technological innovations were introduced in the eighteenth century: rotational
cutting, and twenty year cutting cycles in coniferous trees were both aimed at
providing sustainable harvests. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rights. Institutional changes included the
introduction of contract forestry, in which village communities provided land
and labour, merchants the capital. Another institutional innovation, in which
government or private lands were leased to villagers for afforestation with
proceeds shared according to the terms of contract, became widespread by the
end of the eighteenth century. Also, in some cases, village community or
government lands were divided among households to create new individual
incentives for afforestation. Together these changes caused a move from
unregulated exploitative forestry at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
to extensively organised plantation forestry by the end of the eighteenth
century. These changes supported the coinciding interests of two dominant
classes, feudal lords and merchants, and also responded to peasant rebellions
against restricted access to forests. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Meiji restoration of the nineteenth century
explicitly aimed to make Japan into a modern industrial capitalist country, so
forests were articulated with other sectors of the national economy in new
ways. A centralised, modernizing state abolished and took over feudal control
over forests partly also to undermine feudal power. Forest taxes were
simplified and regularised across fiefs, and made payable in cash. A new
classification of forests was introduced, and 'official forests' expanded to
include those forests used only for gathering, without any spending of other
labour or capital in their upkeep. Municipalities as new administrative units
took over many hamlet forests. Government forest land selling schemes transferred
forests to landlords and timber merchants. Also, since new taxes were levied on
private forests many peasants sold them to other private owners, resulting in
the concentration of forest holdings. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In addition new Forest, River and Erosion Laws, jointly
known as the Three Laws of Flood Control were introduced, tying forest use to
conservation objectives. New 'protection forests' were created, protecting from
all sorts of 'natural' disasters. A Forest Police was empowered to evict
encroachers and farmers illegally on national forest land. The Japan Timber
Standards of 1926 was designed to cut down transaction costs in timber trade by
simplifying the classification of marketable timber. Under new rules village
forest boundaries were demarcated anew, but community rights were so seriously
affected that in the 1890s there was a series of protests throughout the
country leading to arson and looting, neglect of afforestation, and in extreme
cases to burning of imperial and national forests. As a result, new
proceeds-sharing institutions were introduced. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Thus forests now became a sector of the modern

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>natural forests increasingly became 'man-made',
coppice forests became high value-timber growing forests. In other words, as
the state changed and reflected new constellations of interests, the nature of
forests as a resource itself changed. The state attempted also to motivate
non-state forests to follow its lead. The Forest Law of 1907 required large
private forest owners to make forest use plans. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In 1920 the state promoted afforestation in
municipal forests by providing credit and proceeds-sharing. Forest cooperatives
were set up in the 1920s as a medium through which to transmit state
priorities, and subsidies offered to those co-operatives which supported the
flood control plans. In the period after the Second World War, forests were
exempted from the extensive land reforms were passed under American occupation,
despite support from farmers' association. They had been fiercely opposed by
forest landlords, the ministry of agriculture and capitalists. Two
justifications were offered: one that tenancy relationships in forestry were
not as politicised as in agriculture, and two that the shift from the regime of
private ownership might make protection arrangements uncertain, especially for
flood and erosion control. Incentives were also given for afforestation, in the
forms of proceeds sharing between tree planters and land owners. However, most
of the afforestation took place in small holdings, as the beneficiaries of land
reforms invested farm surpluses in silvicultural activities. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the Japanese case as compared to South Asia,
state ownership and control over forests seems to have been more total. States
were involved in directing forest use both towards conservation and revenue
maximisation, with the result being not so much deforestation as a changes in
the species mix. The state also was the source of most of the
institutional-technological innovations, such as land rights to those who
cleared it (in contrast to Purnia), licences for timber trade, contracts, and
even the death penalty to function as a negative incentive. State-led
afforestation measures were responsive to peasant rebellions and included
profit-sharing arrangements. The class nature of the state is evident from
Ninan's forest history: at each stage of state formation, ascendant classes
were able to use the state as an instrument to weaken previously dominant
classes. The evidence of a strong and repressive state following revenue
maximisation and, later, capitalist development, while managing to avoid
deforestation, once again raises the question of the political-economic forms
of the transition to SRD. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As this discussion of the state-class relationships
shows, patterns of resource use are functions of relations between classes and
other social groups, and between them and the state. It could be said that a

environment that a weak state, but this statement also is problematic, since
state capacity varies over time, space and issue area. If topography poses a

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>capacity, as in Purnia, Herring (in Madsen) points
out, using the example of trade in wildlife and timber in India, that the
incomplete control that states have over markets, and on the process by which
economic value is created, restricts state capacity even when the state's
declared intent is conservationist. States are not able on their own to
decommodify aspects of nature, and are unsuccessful in removing them from
circulation in the market, as illegal trade in flora and fauna worldwide has
shown. Centralised control does not translate to the everyday acts of
monitoring and sanctioning, of surveying and stock-taking that state actors
pursuing conservationist and preservationist agendas need to perform. Stated
intent in international fora does not eradicate rampant corruption at lower
levels of the state. In the event that the centralised state has asserted its
authority, such as in the case of the wildlife sanctuaries in the Indian
north-east or wetlands in the north, there have been backlashes ranging from
local mobilisations to nationalist and subnationalist demands. States seem to
have fragile, or at least contested, authority, incomplete knowledge and
control over factors that militate against prudent resource use, shrinking size
and financial base under SAP, and to be under the control of dominant groups
and classes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Public policy recommendations made by several of the
authors outlined earlier seem likely to be frustrated by concerns of political
economy and power relations discussed above. A key question in considering SRD
as a political project is how the necessity for the state can be reconciled
with its declining, uncertain and contested powers. Another, given that the
only generalisable conclusion so far has been that state policies and degrees
of success in their implementation are tied to class relations and the power of
social groups, is to delineate the sorts of politics that would tend to move
state action and capacity towards the SRD agenda. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>actors in developing countries to effect domestic
policy changes within these countries, but there is no evidence to show that
such agency is possible within given political institutions. Where fora exist
to give developing countries a voice in international trade, such as at the
WTO, the North American argument that environmental concerns are barriers to
free trade has won the day, posing serious constraints on the achievement of
SRD. The patenting by American and European companies of genetic materials and
knowledge in plants grown in the developing world has raised the spectre of
biopiracy. SAPS, which Shepherd lauds for favouring SRD, are not just neutral
instruments, but have a more direct negative effect on the poor, and
stabilisation packages are roundly despised in many countries as symbols of
global inequity. While the authors under review are concerned with food
security and poverty alleviation, the Rome Conference refused to recognise the
right to food as a fundamental human right. Further, if one sees the progress
made in the post-Rio period, the expenditure and concerns of the Global
Environmental Facility clearly reflect the priorities of powerful countries.
Livelihoods in arid and semi-arid lands has been a major concern for many of
the writers under review, but a global conference, the current yardstick of the
seriousness with which issues are considered in international environmental
diplomacy, has not yet taken place on desertification. Alternative frameworks
and political projects for achieving SRD therefore must address the structures
of international political economy directly. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>New global-national articulation of resource
economies must be another focus of understanding and political action. By this
I mean the ways in which, facing opportunities or constraints from the global
economy, states change their natural resource use policies. This includes
legal-administrative changes, such of those in Mexico where the state had
planned to scrap the constitutional provision for redistribution of land to
communal holdings, or those of Indian states which are passing a flurry of
'land acquisitions acts' which would make it easier to use agricultural land
for non-agricultural purposes, seen as a bait for foreign investors. Contrary
to Shepherd's claim that the new international policy agenda favours SRD, it
would seem from these examples that it favours specifically capitalist
development, with sustainability a goal only accidentally met if at all.
Another type of relationship worth understanding is the one between the Costa
Rican parastatal agency INBio and Merck, in which Merck funds conservation in
return for potential monopoly rights over Costa Rican biodiversity and
indigenous knowledge about it [Meyer, 19961. This case again reveals the
chances and limits of achieving sustainability within capitalist development. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of SRD agendas discussed here. The recent 'farmers'
caravans' that traveled through Europe represented coalitions that included
farmers from developing and developed countries and protested against the
increasing corporate hold over genetic material such as seeds, though it is not
clear if they also represented all classes of rural producers. The World
Federation of Fishworkers likewise has had success in changing fishing laws in
many countries by linking local with national and global collective action.
Similarly, the global coalition against the Multi-lateral Agreement on
Investment, arguably against the interests of developing countries by providing
unhindered mobility of capital, was able to get it off the agenda. SRD
frameworks and political projects must consider what makes such coalitions
possible and what accounts for their success. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At the next level, SRD seems to require a
fundamental change in the nature of state interventions in resource use. As the
historical perspectives have shown, such state action usually does not have
conservation as its main aims, and when it does, it is not concerned with
poverty alleviation. SRD needs an environmentally enlightened state which acts
competently in the interest of the poor. This leads to two sets of questions:
what leads the state to reach environmental enlightenment, and what would it
take to have the state act consistently in the interests of the poor? As to the
first question works such as Grove [1995] seem to suggest that a major reason
might be powerful scientists responding to and operating within academic
networks, but not that involved with the political economy of resource use.
Clearly, that relationship between state and science cannot be replicated in
many developing countries today, faced as they are with institutional collapse
or at least decline. Besides, the entire model of science as a separate from
society is under attack, not least from votaries of participatory sustainable
development. Another way could be for states to learn from enlightened
international agencies and NGOs, but there is considerable opinion that this
flow of funds and ideas is uni-directional and reflects the interests of donors
and experts rather than some objective agenda, nor is the process without
tension. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The question of state competence or capacity is one
which has not been addressed by most of the essays making policy recommendations.
The state's capacity, for example, to subsidise conservation investment,
assumes that there is no opportunity cost to such expenditure. Likewise, the
recommendation that new land taxes be imposed on the rural rich assumes state
autonomy from them, or state willingness to act against the interest of one of
its key allies. The 'strong hands, weak fingers' analogy that Herring refers to
points to a structural problem with state capacity in terms of enforcement. The
sort of state that can impose an ecologically and socially sustainable agenda
would require autonomy from ruling classes, and </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>alliances with the poor. This would require a change
in the nature of the state in most developing countries, and a realignment of
social forces. How such coalitions can come about and what their relationship
would be with other social groups and the state must be of central concern in
SRD agendas. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As for the relations between the state and the poor
and marginalised, the evidence is not strong that states have kept the
interests of the latter at the core of their policies, that they have had much
success, or where they have had success, it has come about through democratic
means. Some examples are on offer of the politics of subordinate groups, but it
is not clear that sustainability is at their core. Hill discusses a sense of
lurking popular violence against the existing arrangements of access to and use
of resources. From joining the national movement and the Kisan Sabha, Santhals
and other Purnia tenants, sharecroppers and landless labourers by the 1960s had
moved towards Maoism through the Naxalite movement in pursuit of some
resolution of the land question. When the state asserted its authority by
creating and then policing wildlife reserves, Herring shows that the Bodoland
movement in the Indian north-east took up arms against the state since this
meant their access to lands and forests were going to be curtailed. Ninan
points out for Japan that large-scale rebellions by the peasantry against
restrictions on their access to forests were usually followed by institutional
change, such as proceeds-sharing contracts. SRD theoretical frameworks and
political projects must take into account the ways in which mass politics of
this kind changes the relations between social groups and the state, and
sometimes leads to institutional change. As essays in Brass [1995] demonstrate,
farmers' movements in countries such as India want more rather than less
subsidies, and more environmentally damaging inputs to pursue capitalist
agriculture. SRD agendas should be cautious in equating rural political
movements with environmentally positive outcomes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>SRD agendas in many cases rely heavily on 'local
community participation', and this requires an analysis of the full political
significance of these terms. The cases reviewed here, such as those of Purnia,
Punjab and Pakistan for example, show that 'communities' were unequal and
characterised by exploitative relations. If the empowerment requirement of the
more extensive SRD agendas is to be met, a reformulation of the community would
itself have to be a prerequisite. SRD frameworks should include processes
including social movements through which communities are altered, or through
which new collectivities are formed. Cases of user-groups successfully managing
resources must likewise unravel the articulations between them and the state.
Likewise, 'participation' is potentially a deeply political process, since it
aims to transfer the control over resources and decision-making to groups which
have so far been excluded from such control. But it is not clear from the
essays what the unit of </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>participation should be. The use of 'households' in
most of the essays in Vosti and Reardon persists despite decades of research on
gender within the household. In other cases, 'local communities' are offered
without discussing its internal configurations. There are of course positive
examples. Gooch provides details of the community forest management plan put
forward by the <i>van gujjars</i>, which highlight their intimate knowledge and
long history of interaction with the forests and wildlife to make claims to
rights in the Rajaji National Park. They assert that they too are of the
forest, and want training and employment in the park so that they can become
involved in curbing illegal activities in the forest and in forest
regeneration. Their blueprint for democratic control over the forest and of
institutional cooperation with the Park authorities has received wide acclaim.
But in other cases, treating households and communities as a whole can hide and
exacerbate domination based on class, caste gender and age lines. Besides, as
Ghai and Vivian [1992] point out, it is relevant to ask whose project communities
are participating in, and whether they share the SRD agenda in whose
implementation and design they are encouraged to participate. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shepherd suggests 'new professionals' and
'development workers' who will work in radically-new ways, such as PRA, to interact
with 'local communities', and take them through the legal system to pursue
their rights and environmental sustainability. Certainly, there are numerous
examples of NGOs that have done exemplary work in this regard. But there is no
generalisable conclusion regarding their role, much less about their
relationship with the groups on whose behalf they work. Secondly, there is no
discussion on the motivations of these agents. When the emphasis of new
institutionalism is so much on the incentives created by new institutions for
poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, it is hard to imagine
what incentives these agents might have. As for technical change, including
finding location-specific solutions, it is equally hard to imagine how existing
institutions can carry out the requisite research in a period of low
expenditure on agricultural research, or where new institutions will come from.

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The articles under review do have a sense of the
sorts of changes that would facilitate SRD, but the priority of policy over
politics is ultimately frustrating to the agendas themselves. The question is,
will the sorts of institutional and technological changes recommended here lead
to the structural changes needed for the transition to SRI)? One would have to answer
that question in the negative; indeed, many of the recommendations would need
structural changes as prerequisites for achieving desired results. Further
research should focus on the formation of collective identities, the changing
articulations between social groups, states and the international system, and
the process by which an agenda for policy reform becomes a mass demand for
political transformation. </p>
