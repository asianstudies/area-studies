The vast unwieldy categories of caste in South Asia were classified for some purposes into four
broad groups: priest (brahman), warrior (kshatriya), merchant (viashya), and servant (shudra).
Beyond these groups were various communities of outsiders classified in the late nineteenth
century as "untouchable" or "outcaste." Historians of nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century
South Asia have placed enormous importance on the British Census of India as creator, fomenter,
and sustainer of a new politics of caste advantage. With their Victorian mania for precise
classification, colonial census officials created a complex taxonomy of all Indian society organized
around precise definitions of caste. Within the fluid and ever-changing boundaries of South Asia's
communities, everyone had to be placed somewhere by the government.<p>

In the early secular, democratic years of independent India, the politics of community and caste
continued unabated, although transformed by the attempts of successive governments to conduct
affirmative action programs for communities now designated as "backward" or "depressed." The
complexity of identifying "backward" classes was evident it's the first report of the government's
Backward Classes Commission in 1953, which identified 2,399 castes in need of special
government help. A subsequent report issued by the Mandal Commission in 1980 expanded the
list to 3,743 representing over half the population of India.<p>

William R. Pinch focuses on the struggle for social and political advantage by low-caste peasants
in the eastern Gangetic plain of North India (now included in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh).
Although Pinch directs his arguments primarily to specialists in South Asian social, political, and
religious history, a Victorianist interested in arguments about imperialism and postcolonialisin will
recognize the revisionist implications of this study. <i>Peasants arid Monks</i> is a "post-subaltern"
study of peasant militancy. Instead of depicting peasants as locked into struggle with hegemonic
superiors of the British colonial state and their allies among collaborationist Indian elites, Pinch
treats peasants as autonomous historical actors drawing on a variety of rhetorical resources to
redefine their position in colonial Indian society. Although lie takes the importance of the census
for granted, his search for alternative sources of influence has the effect of demoting the
importance of the colonial presence in nineteenth-century Indian society.<p>

Pinch argues dial the struggle for caste advantage was not entirely a creation of British
colonialists. Before arid during colonial rude, Shudra peasants had found alternatives to the
rigidities of the caste structure in traditions of militarist monasticism based on the 

[<b>++page 677</b>] 

teachings of egalitarian gurus. A new strategy appeared in the nineteenth century with the
articulation of alternative religious genealogies supplied to subordinate peasant groups. Mw
advent of cheap printing in Hindi appears to have given an advantage to new Voices, pews"
intellectuals who created new religious genealogies and whose authority supplanted dot of the
monastic and temple gurus who had traditionally appealed to lower status Hindus. According to
these narratives, the Shudra peasants of the eastern Gangetic plain were not Shudras at all, but
Kshatriyas of military lineage. The low-caste peasants of north India woe drawing on Indian
sources, some but not all of them mediated through colonial scholarship, to forge a new and
aggressively egalitarian politics of social and caste advantage.<p>

Pinch traces the late colonial politics of peasant militancy into the post-independence period,
where "backward" caste status suddenly became an advantage ratter than a disability. Having
taken the trouble to show that they were not "depressed,' Shudra peasant representatives found
themselves arguing for special post-independence government programs to aid them because they
were "depressed." The irony was even grater for untouchable Indians, who were outside the
formal structure of caste altogether. Having struggled to shed their stigmatized status in the
colonial period, they found it necessary to reclaim it in independent India. Many untouchables
became Christian, and Indian Christians are now struggling for political reasons to reclaim their
stigmatized status. Although mentioning scholarly works on untouchables, Pinch neglects the
parallels between low-caste peasant politics on the one hand and untouchable political movements
on the other. The Chamar (lather worker) caste in particular lived side by side with the low-caste
but not untouchable peasants who populate this study, and Pinch cites the scholarship on the
Chamars without extensive commentary on what appear to be rather obvious parallel political and
religious changes.<p>

An important and carefully argued work of revisionism, Pinch takes us beyond the analysis of
colonial orientalism, and beyond the Saidian unmasking of the culture of colonial rule, to a search
for Indian sources of Indian social change. Reflecting current interest in political and religious
rhetoric as engines of social change, he focuses on public argument and politically charged
narrative as a means of understanding social history.<p>
