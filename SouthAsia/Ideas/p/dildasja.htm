<p>Joseph S. Alter <b>Knowing Dil Das</b>: <i>Stories of a Himalayan Hunter.</i>
216 1999<br>
<p>ISBN: 0-8122-3524-X Cloth $39.95 
<br>ISBN: 0-8122-1712-8 Paper $17.50 
<p>"This book will become a classic. It has passion, compelling stories, sober
reflection, and an incredibly artful structure that carries the reader
along. Most important, like all great anthropology, the story speaks to the
issue of what constitutes the human spirit. There is wisdom in this book,
and for that rare gift I am grateful to Dil Das and Joseph Alter."--Paul
Stoller, author of Sensuous Scholarship<p>Dil Das was a poor farmer--an
untouchable--living near Mussoorie, a colonial hill station in the
Himalayas. As a boy he became acquainted with a number of American
missionary children attending a boarding school in town and, over the
years, developed close friendships with them and, eventually, with their
sons. The basis for these friendships was a common passion for hunting.
This passion and the friendships it made possible came to dominate Dil
Das's life.<p>When Joseph S. Alter, one of the boys who had hunted with Dil
Das, became an adult and a scholar, he set out to write the life history of
Dil Das as a way of exploring Garhwali peasant culture. But Alter found his
friend uninterested in talking about traditional ethnographic subjects,
such as community life, family, or work. Instead, Dil Das spoke almost
exclusively about hunting with his American friends--telling endless tales
about friendship and hunting that seemed to have nothing to do with peasant
culture.<p>When Dil Das died in 1986, Alter put the project away. Years
later, he began rereading Dil Das's stories, this time from a completely
new perspective. Instead of looking for information about peasant culture,
he was able to see that Dil Das was talking against culture. From this
viewpoint Dil Das's narrative made sense for precisely those reasons that
had earlier seemed to render it useless--his apparent indifference toward
details of everyday life, his obsession with hunting, and, above all, his
celebration of friendship.<p>To a degree in fact, but most significantly in
Dil Das's memory, hunting served to merge his and the missionary boys'
identities and, thereby, to supersede and render irrelevant all differences
of class, caste, and nationality. For Dil Das the intimate experience of
hunting together radically decentered the prevailing structure of power and
enabled him to redefine himself outside the framework of normal social
classification.<p>Thus, Knowing Dil Das is not about peasant culture but
about the limits of culture and history. And it is about the moral
ambiguity of writing and living in a field of power where, despite
intimacy, self and other are unequal.<p>Joseph Alter teaches anthropology
at the University of Pittsburgh. He is the author of The Wrestler's Body:
Identity and Ideology in North India.
