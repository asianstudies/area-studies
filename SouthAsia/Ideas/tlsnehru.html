<hr>

The half-century celebrations of India's Independence in August 1947 
rightly highlight the career of Jawaharlal Nehru, who, as India's first 
Prime Minister until his death in 1964, was the main architect of the 
new democratic nation-state. Far beyond the domestic confines of 
the subcontinent, he was a towering figure of the emerging post-colonial 
world, and stands beside his great mentor, Mahatma Gandhi, and 
China's Chairman Mao among the great Asian leaders of the century. 
He was a complex yet compelling personality, whose career encompassed 
many creative ironies. As a radical nationalist, he struggled to bring 
down the British Raj in India, then transformed himself into an 
administrator and statesman, inheriting many of the structures 
and personnel of the imperial regime he had so opposed. An 
old Harrovian and graduate of <a href="http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/">
Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, he spent nine years incarcerated 
in the Raj's gaols for his nationalist activities; yet bore British people 
no ill will for this treatment, and subsequently as Prime Minister 
mixed easily with British politicians and aristocrats, helping to 
transform the British Commonwealth by securing India's continued 
membership of it after she had become a republic. He was a patrician 
and an intellectual, yet became a skilled populist politician and a 
great electoral campaigner in the world's largest emergent democracy.<p>

<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/uvalib-forward/http://www.oup.co.uk/">Oxford University Press</a> has 
published two books on Nehru in time for the August celebrations, 
one a reprint of a 1995 collection of essays by the eminent Indian 
historian, B. R. Nanda, former Director of the Nehru Memorial 
Museum and Library in New Delhi, and a new biography by 
Stanley Wolpert, a senior American historian, notable for his 
studies of other Indian leaders, including Nehru's great adversary, 
M. A. Jinnah, founder of Pakistan. Both authors are experienced 
professionals in their field, but no two books on the same 
subject could be more unlike.<p>

             Nanda's is a cautious book, meticulous in its use of 
archival sources and careful in its judgments, though the 
author's sympathy with his subject is clear. The essay 
format enables Nanda to engage profoundly with different 
aspects of Nehru's life and career more easily than in a 
chronological study. Three essays, most unusually, discuss 
Nehru as a writer. Alone of all his contemporaries, Nehru 
was a serious intellectual, an avid reader and an author 
of considerable depth, with a beautiful English style. Long 
years in gaol helped his literary development. His writings 
included an autobiography, a study of Indian history and a 
collection of carefully crafted letters to his daughter, Indira, 
and later to the Chief Ministers of the States in the new Indian 
Union. Nanda devotes other essays to Nehru's relations 
with a range of notable contemporaries - his father, Motilal, 
his mentor, Gandhi, and his angry contemporary, Subhas Bose. 
He also focuses on Nehru's beliefs, particularly his understanding 
of religion and of socialism; and on issues or episodes which 
were crucial or controversial in Nehru's career - his role in the 
eventual partition of the subcontinent, his ideas on economic 
planning and on foreign policy, particularly the stance of 
non-alignment in world affairs. We are left with the picture 
of a human dynamo, who drove himself relentlessly, who 
was passionate about freedom, equality and social justice, 
who tackled the immense problems his country faced at 
Independence in a way even Gandhi did not; yet one 
whose policies led his country into administrative malaise 
and near-bankruptcy after his death.  Perhaps more 
seriously, so great was his political stature and so 
mercurial his temperament that he failed to raise up 
and nurture political successors who could carry forward 
his vision and manage the increasingly turbulent politics 
of the subcontinent. Nanda claims to write for both students 
of India and the general reader. Yet this remains a 
professional's book, and an important one: for the general 
reader, there is no background on the nature of Indian politics 
or of British imperialism which would set the carefully 
reasoned arguments in a necessary context.<p>

             Wolpert's biography raises even more serious 
questions about readership. Totally in contrast to Nanda's 
measured style, judicious judgment and careful use of 
sources, Wolpert's is a chatty, rambling study, replete 
with literary and rhetorical devices and neat throw-away 
lines which undermine its historical credibility. It is  biographical 
in shape, but is grossly imbalanced, with only the last 
ninety pages dealing with the vital years of Nehru's 
premiership. It is too long and detailed for the general 
reader but seriously deficient for the genuine scholar 
student of India. Its length depends on copious quotations 
from Nehru's letters and other writings rather than on 
the fruits of original research or interpretation. Evidently 
the author was unable to gain access to new family or 
official sources, and had to rely on the published 
<i>Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru</i> and numerous 
biographical studies and personal reminiscences.<p>

             The racy narrative style precludes serious analysis - 
either of Nehru himself or of his changing position in the 
politics of India. Among the most obvious issues are the 
nature of the Indian National Congress before and after 
1947, particularly its socio-economic base and its relationship 
to the different regions of India; and the nature of Indian Islam, 
the reasons behind Jinnah's emergence as a "Muslim 
leader", and the build-up of support for the idea of Pakistan. 
(Significant new scholarship on these issues receives no 
mention at all.)   
<img align=left src="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Img/nehrufam.gif"> 
Without this, Nehru's role as a nationalist politician 
and his peculiar position as Gandhi's "heir" but without 
a serious local power base (in contrast to many of the 
Congress grandees such as Vallabhbhai Patel) are inexplicable. 
We are told that in the 1950s Nehru enjoyed "unlimited, 
indeed, virtually unchallenged power over the Indian 
republic". But why, then, was he unable to achieve after 
Independence so many of the things which he held dear, 
and indeed vital for the emergence of a new India - the 
eradication of "communalism" and the growth of a secular 
ideal of the new India, the transformation of the administrative 
services inherited from imperial masters, radical social reform 
and redistribution of material resources? There is cursory 
mention of economic planning, but nothing on the struggles 
to achieve land reform, or the issues of caste, the eradication 
of untouchability, the status of women, or the struggle to 
galvanize Indian agriculture. For Nehru, such issues were 
central to his life and to describe that life without attention 
to them is to diminish him greatly. But to address them would 
involve analysis of his ambiguous political position in an 
increasingly complex political context, where the constraints 
of India's federal structure, of the nature of Congress as a 
party, and the conservatism of much of Indian society limited 
his real power to change affairs. Ultimately, they wore him out.<p>

                    Wolpert bases his study entirely on personality. 
He over-credits Nehru with power and influence as an individual, 
but also structures the account of his life round his personal 
relationships in a way that is at times gratuitously distasteful. 
Running through the study is a strand of psychological 
"analysis" founded on virtually no evidence. The assumption 
is that Nehru was a covert homosexual who dared not face the 
truth about himself. Instead, Wolpert seems to argue, he 
compensated for his unsatisfactory marriage with a series 
of relationships with women, the most notable of whom was 
of course Edwina Mountbatten, the last vicereine. Casual 
asides and innuendoes are plentiful in this context. But 
Wolpert does not establish what difference these relationships 
made to his public life. More important is the treatment of 
Nehru's relationship with the woman who was to be central 
to India's public life in the two decades after his death - 
his only child and daughter, Indira, mother of the ill-fated 
Rajiv and Sanjay. Wolpert uses to good effect the letters
which passed between them during their prolonged separations, 
and shows how she developed from a sickly student into a 
powerful woman, confident enough to leave her husband 
and establish her- [begin <b>Page 8</b>] self as her father's 
hostess and constant companion. Where Wolpert errs is to 
argue (often by assertion rather than from hard evidence) 
that Nehru was "grooming" her for succession. There is 
little in Wolpert's text or elsewhere to suggest that this 
was so: rather the contrary - for Nehru refused to undermine 
the democratic process by which his party should select 
his successor.<p>

                    Nehru deserves serious scholarship and the 
skills to communicate his ideals and significance to a 
wider audience: his vision of a new India and a new 
world order, his struggles, his successes and failures are a 
window on to the making of the twentieth century, in particular 
the formative processes of colonial nationalism, 
decolonization and the creation of new states and national 
identities out of the experience of imperial rule. Nehru's 
life and writings are potentially so accessible that they 
are a valuable point of departure for scholars and 
non-specialist readers alike who have a serious 
interest in understanding both this century in global 
terms, and more narrowly how India has come to be 
what she is.<p>

                    Nehru was the butt of jokes about being 
"a British gentleman" and "the last viceroy". But at 
a deeper level he was a crucial bridging figure between 
different worlds. In the period of his premiership he 
connected the worlds of Asia and the West, at home 
in both, interpreting one to another, despite misunderstandings. 
His unique position from the 1930s as the Congress 
politician who took international affairs seriously 
positioned him at Independence to be his own 
foreign minister and to sway India's foreign policy 
much more decisively than he could ever manage 
her domestic affairs. Not only did he confirm India's 
independence in terms of international policy and set 
an example for other new countries emerging from the 
British imperial connection; he also brought to international 
relations a powerful idealism, and in practical terms was 
one of the architects of the new Commonwealth as a free 
association of independent nations rather than a cosy 
club for the former white dominions. In the domestic world 
of Indian politics, he acted as a bridge between the constrained 
world of political participation under the Raj and the 
increasingly turbulent world of the test quarter of the century. 
His role in, and regard for, the Congress Party, his nurturing 
of a democratic and idealistic constitution, his commitment 
to parliamentary government and serious regard for the 
Indian parliament, and his skills as an election-winning 
politician all helped to build on the foundations laid by 
the pre-1947 Congress. His integrity and commitment to 
democracy and to high standards in public life served 
India well; the experience of her subcontinental neighbours 
and of many new African states, as well as of India itself 
under the leadership of his daughter, underlines his stature. 
Nehru's failures were also apparent - the costly paralysis 
in relations with Pakistan over Kashmir, draining much-needed 
resources into military spending and away from developmental 
projects at home; his blindness to China's intentions, 
despite warnings even from Vallabhbhai Patel immediately 
after Independence; his uncritical relationship with Krishna 
Menon, the defence minister who landed the army in a 
disastrous mess for which they were completely unprepared 
in 1962, when China invaded; and his failure to nurture 
political talent in the longer term to provide India with a 
broad swathe of experienced political leaders who could 
inherit his many roles. Despite his commitment to socialist 
ideals, he failed to achieve radical change in Indian society, 
and his commitment to planning and state regulation of the 
economy eventually stunted India's economic growth. Nor 
did he recognize the danger that a rising population would 
pose for India's ability to improve basic standards of health, 
education and employment among the poorest. Yet he was a 
great visionary, a man driven to the edge of personal 
destruction to prove that a new nation could retrieve and 
remake its inheritance, redeem in some sense its colonial 
past, and so organize its common life to aspire to ideals 
of justice, equality and liberty.<p>
