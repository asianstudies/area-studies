<tr><td> This study examines society in a province of colonial India over
six decades: the Central Provinces from 1861 to 1921. In order to
assess the colonial administrative system three activities are
highlighted--policy formation, implementation, and the changing
influences of Indian actions and institutions. Specific case
studies of Indian communities and their arenas of activities then
follow.<p>

The Study consists of three Parts. In the first the character of
earlier administrations and the filling in of the area's social
frontier before 1861 are described using the concept of four
subregions within the administrative region. The British
administrator's social setting of re-creating English enclaves is
also analyzed as part of the background. The second Pa~t stresses
the limitations of British colonial rule because of its
concentration on consolidative institutions, minimal expenditure
on developmental and social service institutions, and its lack of
control over economic forces and events. Especially reviewed are
the way in which the introduction of Western education influenced
different segments of the population, the types of local
self-government institutions established and political
developments, the efforts to provide health-care and demographic
trends, and finally British land policies ar,d Indian adjustments
to them.<p>
 The last Part analyzes three case studies which reveal the
differential effects of colonial rule. The first case study looks
at the Marwari business family of Raja Gokuldas who benefited
from their collaboration with the British during the Mutiny and
afterwards. Gokuldas eventually built a commercial empire
which<p>
[<b>Abstract page 2</b>]<p>
extended far beyond the confines of the province and included
many banks, shops, markets, land holdings, and several modern
factories.Second, the Baiga tribe were threatened by the new
rules and procedures of the British administration which
confiscated much of their land for forest conservation and
pursued a policy of transforming the Baigas from forest to
regular field cultivators. The third case study is of the
low-caste Chamars of Chhattisgarh. They attempted to improve
their social status and their economic position. As they were a
large proportion of the farmers in the area, they benefited from
some of the new economic opportunities provided by the
construction of the railway in the late nineteenth century. This
also produced increased opposition by landlords toward some
Chamars in their villages and further problems at times of
economic crisis such as the famines of the late 1890s. They, like
the Baigas, adopted several method in order to survive these
changing and difficult conditions.<p>

 The examination of the colonial administration generally and of
these three case studies specifically indicates the different
ways through which Indian society and the British administration
interacted with each other over six decades.<p>

<center><table width="90%">

<tr><td> In 1861 for the first time a large and diverse area of central
India was brought under a single British provincial
administration.The main purpose of creating the Central Provinces
was to develop the area by introducing Western institutions,
improving communications,and stimulating production, especially
in agriculture. The area had been isolated from other parts of
India and was considered backward.  It stretched from the Vindhya
hills in the north to the Deccan plateau in the south, and the
Orissan hills in the east to the rich cotton producing plain of
Berar in the west. This study examines the history of Indian
society under British rule in the Central Provinces over six
decades from 1861 to 1921, concentrating on both the newly
established Western institutions and the activities of selected
Indian communities. Since this area of colonial India has not
attracted much scholarly research in recent years, the two main
purposes of the study are to provide basic information on the
area, and to suggest several themes and make preliminary
observations about them.<p>

 In the 1960s and 1970s several historians have criticized the
historiography which was current during the colonial period and
in part still endures. Bernard Cohn, Anil Seal and Tom Kessinger
among others have generally suggested the earlier studies
concentrated on the vicissitudes of British policy formation at
the top levels of<p>

[++<b>Page 2</b>]<p>

administration.<A NAME="rf002.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N002.1"><SUP>1</SUP></a> 
This approach tended to ignore the uneven,
piecemeal implementation of British policy at the regional and
local levels and often failed to recognize changes and
continuities within Indian society.<p>

 In accepting some of these and other suggestions, this study has
adopted two approaches for reassessing the colonial period. One
is to indicate the interconnection, or lack of it, between
British policy and implementation while recognizing the
initiative of Indians to develop alternative institutions and
participate in activities which often paralleled the
administrative structure. A second approach examines Indian
communities in their own local setting to assess social,
economic, and political continuities and changes.<p>

 Besides the need to reassess the colonial period by new
approaches,one of the clear and basic motives for selecting the
Central Provinces is that it has not attracted considerable
attention and examination.D. Baker's thesis on the Central
Provinces from 1919 to 1939 and Peter Harnetty's articles on its
economic aspects from 1861 to 1921 remain almost the only recent
research efforts. Two reasons for its past obscurity or
unpopularity appear to he its inferior position during British
rule in India and its extreme diversity. On the one hand the<p>

[++<b>Page 3</b>]<p>

British gave it comparatively little attention, and on the other
hand its heterogeneity presented, and still continues to present
problems for easy characterization and analysis.<p>

 Sources were collected during one year of research in London and
three months tour of the area of the old Central Provinces in
India.The sources consist primarily of the monthly proceedings of
the Provincial administration, district settlement reports and
gazetteers,biographical materials, and discussions with
descendants of prominent families of the Central Provinces.<p>

 The topics of the dissertation are divided into three Parts.The
first describes the British images of the Central Provinces and
the life style of the British community. The second stresses the
limitations of British colonial rules because of its
concentration on consolidative institutions, minimal expenditure
on developmental and social service institutions, and the lack of
control over economic activities and events. The last Part
analyses three case studies which reveal the differential affect
of British colonial rule.The first case study looks at the
Marwari business family of Raja Gokuldas who benefited from their
collaboration with the British during the Mutiny and afterwards.
The second examines the tribal Baigas of upland Balaghat district
and how British rule threatened their survival. The third case
study is of the low-caste Chamars of Chhattisgarh. As a large
proportion of the farmers in the area they benefited from new
economic opportunities, but also were opposed by upper-caste and
upper class Hindu landlords. Each of these case studies indicates
different ways through which Indian communities changed during
the initial six decades of colonial rule in the Central
Provinces.<p>
