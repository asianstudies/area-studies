The Raja Seth Gokuldas family of Jabalpur became one of the most
renowned wealthy families of the Central Provinces. In late l908,
on the day after the death of Raja Gokuldas, the head of the
family, twenty-five thousand persons in Jabalpur accompanied the
funeral procession; the city's courts, schools, shops and markets
were closed.  In respectful recognition of the family's substantial
business in Bombay, the cotton market at Kolaba and the wheat
market in Dana Bandar also closed.  
<A NAME="rf342.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N342.1"><SUP>342.1</SUP></a><p>

This Marwari family exhibited many characteristics of other
Marwari&quot;great firms&quot; in different parts of India. 
<A NAME="rf342.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N342.2"><SUP>342.2</SUP></a> In
the Central Provinces it was one of the wealthiest elite
families. During the nineteenth century other Marwari families
spread out into many parts of India;northern India, Calcutta,
Bombay, the Deccan, and Madras. Early in the century, Raja
Gokuldas' grandfather, Sevaram, settled in the small trading town
of Jabalpur and soon began to establish the family's position
in<p>

<b>++Page 343</b><p>

society and their rapid rise in wealth. Eventually their business
and trading activities spread to several parts of northern
Central Provinces, then to other parts of the province, and in
time to Bombay, Calcutta, Rangoon, Central India, Etawah (United
Provinces), and Multan (Sind). Few other families of the Central
Provinces had such far-reaching connections.<p>

 Like other large Marwari firms the family participated in a wide
variety of economic activities. They were money-lenders,
brokers,traders, government treasurers, industrialists and
landlords. As in other Marwari firms, the management and
ownership was retained in the hands of the immediate family. The
firm rarely allowed others to become partners in the firm or its
branches. <A NAME="rf343.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N343.1"><SUP>343.1</SUP></a><p>

 The relations between the firm and the British rulers and
administration was not consistently good. At times the British
welcomed the financial help the family offered in loans to
indebted families under the Court of Wards, for municipal
development and other purposes.The British frequently used the
firm's financial facilities to handle and transfer funds. At
other times the British strongly objected to the role of the
family as large landlords. Local British officials favored
village landlords of agricultural castes and often cited the
family as an example of an unwanted development--the transfer-of
village ownership to large absentee money-lending families.
Though the family<p>

<b>++Page 344</b><p>

members acquired honorary titles, participated in district and
municipal government institutions, and continued to reside at
Jabalpur for almost a century, they were not included among the
nominees for selection to the Governor-General's Legislative
Council in 1893. 
<A NAME="rf344.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N344.1"><SUP>344.1</SUP></a>  
The Chief Commissioner considered the family
still foreigners (Marwaris) whose reputation was based solely on
wealth rather than landlord status. This tension and difference
with the British may have encouraged the grandson of Raja
Gokuldas, Govind Das, to join the National Congress in the early
1920s. He continued to carry on the tradition of a respected
family in the Central Provinces, and eventually represented the
state of Madhya Pradesh in the Lok Sabha (National Assembly).<p>

The forefathers of Gokuldas originally came to Jabalpur from
Jaisalmir, Rajasthan, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
They belonged to the Malpani section of the Maheshwari caste
cluster. 
<A NAME="rf344.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N344.2"><SUP>344.2</SUP></a>
 The reasons for their departure from Jaisalmir and
forgoing to Jabalpur are uncertain. The Jaisalmir state, located
at the extreme western part of Rajasthan, reached its height in
power and wealth in the middle of the seventeenth century, but
steadily declined thereafter. The departure of the Gokuldas
family and other merchants may have been due also to local
political changes of the [area.]<p>

[Though Gokuldas may not have been] 
directly involved in these two associations, he was noted for his
leadership in the Maheshwari caste association. When the
Maheshwari Sabha held its first meeting in 1907 at Amraoti, he
was elected its president. Over ten thousand visitors and
delegates attended the conference. 
<A NAME="rf397.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N397.1"><SUP>397.1</SUP></a> Even after Gokuldas' death in
1909, the Maheshwari newspaper, the &quot;Maheshwari
Patrika&quot; of Aligarh, carried articles and items recalling
his activities and incidents from his life as moral examples. 
<A NAME="rf397.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N397.2"><SUP>397.2</SUP></a>
These activities by the members of the family indicate the
family's participation in a variety of official and voluntary
associations.<p>

</font></center><p>

In the first years of the nineteenth century Jabalpur served
as a small market and administrative center. As a trade depot on
the road to Mirzapur, wheat and forest produce poured into Jabalpur from
the surrounding countryside for transport by bullock pack and
cart across the Vindhya hills to the Ganges plain. Local
administrative officials received directives from the Maratha
Pundits in Saugor who in turn came under the jurisdiction of the
Nagpur Bhonsla rulers,members of the Maratha Confederacy. By the
end of the first quarter of the century, local administrative
control had shifted from Saugor to Jabalpur and from Maratha to
British hands. The Governor-General's<p>

<b>++Page 398</b><p>

Agent for the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories and his staff
received directives from Calcutta transmitted through Allahabad.
A small garrison of troops was stationed on the outskirts of the
town. By then also a recently immigrant Marwari family had become
active participants in Jabalpur's banking and trading life.
Sevaram bought some property next to the burning &quot;hats of
Jabalpur's Hanuman Tal and established the family's residence
there.<p>

 In the early 1860s Jabalpur was combined with other British
territories in central India to form the Central Provinces. The
town as selected as one of the four Divisional headquarters. Even
before the railway reached Jabalpur from Allahabad to the
northeast and from Bombay to the southwest in the late 1860s,
Jabalpur's trade had begun to move in a reverse direction. 
<A NAME="rf398.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N398.1"><SUP>398.1</SUP></a>
Instead of flowing mainly toward the Ganges plain in the
northeast, it now fed the territories of Nagpur and Berar to the
southwest, where farmers had increasingly turned to specializing
in cotton production to meet the upsurge of a foreign demand.<p>

 By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,
Jabalpur was well established as the largest commercial and
administrative town in northern Central Provinces. The road to
the provincial capital,Nagpur, had been improved, and a recently
constructed narrow-gauge<p>

<b>++ Page 399</b><p>

railway from the forest hills of the Satpura range to the south
also converged on Jabalpur and conveyed trade to and from the
town. The local administration and the municipal committee had
fostered and constructed public buildings to house officials and
departments, and public works to provide a moderate amount of
public services. Gokuldas had financed a small beginning in
industry by establishing a gun-carriage factory, cotton and flour
mills, and a tile manufacturing plant. Throughout the century,
Sevaram's descendants prayed a prominent role in the expansion of
Jabalpur's economic and administrative life through their divers!
financial activities and their support of public
institutions.<p>

The history of Jabalpur during the nineteenth century was
closely tied to the expansion both of British administration and
the Gokuldas commercial dynasty. Both became established as new
factors in the area early in the century? and grew in power and
prestige during the following decades. For the British, Jabalpur
district was merely one more small tract of territory which was
conquered and incorporated into the Indian Empire. But for the
Raja Gokuldas dynasty, Jabalpur became its base, its center for
economic conquest into other parts of the Central Provinces and
soon into other parts of India and beyond. Neither the British
nor Gokuldas ever obtained complete, exclusive and totalitarian
control in their respective spheres of domination over economic
and social resources. Other persons, institutions and forces set
limits on the opportunities for administrative and economic
expansion. Even in the relationship between the government and
Gokuldas, though they usually found it<p>

<b>++Page 400</b><p>

mutually beneficial to collaborate in overlapping spheres of
activity, there were times when they differed and came into conflict over
goals and policies; and at other times it was best to keep out of
each other's way and pursue independent activities. Nonetheless,
by the late nineteenth century, each had developed such powerful
positions in the area that it was not possible to ignore each
other for long or in any important sphere of activity.<p>

The founding father of the Gokuldas dynasty, Sevaram, migrated
to Jabalpur from Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) during the first years of
the nineteenth century. 
<A NAME="rf400.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N400.1"><SUP>400.1</SUP></a> As a Maheshwari of the Malpani clan, he
evidently brought with him the business skills and techniques for
which his broader caste, the Marwaris, had a traditional
reputation. By the time of his death in 1834 he had established a
sound base for the expansion of the family's fortunes and
influence. The first rooms for the family's residence had been
built on the banks of Hanuman Tal, near Jabalpur's market center.
Several shops providing trade and banking services had been
organized, some in alliance with other local traders such as the
ancestors of Kanhaiyalal and Punamchand. With the purchase of a
dozen villages, Sevaram began the family custom of investment in
land. The first steps to erect the family's worship center, the
Shri Gopal Lal Temple, had been completed and Sevaram's two sons
had become initiated into membership of the Vallabha Hindu<p>

<b>++Page 401</b><p>

sect under the guidance of a guru at Benares. Sevaram had made
some of the first contributions to Jabalpur's public life by
having a tank and a garden built in the town. A local British
officer had recognized Sevaram as one of the leading bankers and
traders of the town.  Almost all of these activities established
traditions which Sevaram's successors continued in later
years.<p>

 Because of coincidental circumstances, the dynasty had few
succession problems. Each generation subsequently found only one
successor in command. Khushalchand succeeded Sevaram even though
he was the younger of two surviving sons. The older son,
Ramkrishnadas,devoted himself almost exclusively to religious
activities; later his widow died before a judgment on a suit,
that threatened to breakup the succession pattern, came to trial in
1847. So, too,Khusalchand's son, Gokuldas, became the sole
inheritor of the reins of the family's wealth and power in 1869
when his younger brother (Gopaldas) died, four years after
Khusalchand's death. Although both a son and a nephew of
Gokuldas, Jiwandas and Ballabhdas, equally divided the inheritance when
Gokuldas died in 1909, within 4 or 5 years the dynasty lay in
almost complete financial ruin. It took several years of
energetic efforts by Govindas, Gokuldas' grandson,to revive the prestige,
wealth and power of the dynasty before it could regain and then
exceed its previous stature.<p>

The history of the Das dynasty over the five generations from
Sevaram to Govindas presents a varied picture of expansion and
consolidation of wealth and power. Sevaram provided the base for
later expansion--not only did he found the headquarters of the
&quot;kingdom,&quot;<p>

<b>++ Page 402</b><p>

but he established lasting traditions of spheres of activity and 
patterns of alliances. Khushalchand maintained these and expanded
them. The number of shops and the control of capital for
investment,lending, and trade increased during his reign. Marital
ant religious alliances brought the dynasty into contact with
areas outside the province. Most important, his assistance to the
British during 1857-58 placed the dynasty in a favored position.
For some years the fund of British indebtedness to the dynasty
paid off handsomely, not just in monetary terms of the award of
government contacts and loans, but also in prestige and trust.
After weathering a family crisis of the late 186Os and the early
1870s, Gokuldas turned in earnest to make the most of the wider
contacts and increased prestige inherited from his father. In the
1880s he consolidated the dynasty's commercial and prestige
position in the province. In the 1890s he turned his
concentration to areas beyond the confines of the
province#Especially in Rajasthan, his caste and family homeland,
he received an honorary recognition of his high position, and
went on to make advantageous financial commitments. In the same
decade, he expanded into a new activity--industry--thus combining
his control over markets and raw materials such as wheat and
cotton with the processing of them. In the fourth generation,
power was shared by two cousins. Both rejected Gokuldas' advice
for moderation. Jiwandas gained the reputation as an extravagant
spender. Ballabhdas exhausted considerable of his wealth in
market speculation. The decline of the dynasty during their time,
however, was more than checked during the reign of the fifth
generation. The details of the revival in wealth and<p>

<b>++Page 403</b><p>

especially in power is recounted in Govindas' autobiographies,
and analyzed in its local Jabalpur setting in a dissertation. 
<A NAME="rf403.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N403.1"><SUP>403.1</SUP></a>
Our main interest centers on the middle reign of the Das dynasty,
the Gokuldas period.<p>

Gokuldas's firm and its activities and position as a Raja or
&quot;king&quot; may be viewed as &quot;kingdom&quot; or domain.
Although his-kingdom might not exactly correspond to some
definitions of kingdoms, it nevertheless functioned as a power,
ruling over its own &quot;territory,&quot; with its own
regulations and structure of supervision, its own particular
ideology, and surrounded by symbols of royalty. It is more than
coincidence that Gokuldas eventually received recognition as a
Raja within the British Raj, or that his residence in Jabalpur
became known as the Raja Gokuldas Palace. Unlike administrative
and military rulers, who have dominion over contiguous land
areas, the kingdom of the Das dynasty included administrative
control over widely scattered landed estates, as well as control
over money, markets, products, and people. The exact extent of
his &quot;territory&quot;is difficult to define, not only because
it changed in time, but also because it goes beyond our usual
concepts of &quot;territoriality &quot;   and
&quot;sovereignty.&quot; <A NAME="rf403.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N403.2"><SUP>403.2</SUP></a> Nevertheless same definition of the
minimal extent of the territory can be presented. The
&quot;territory&quot; of his kingdom consisted of more than 200
village lands; the capital involved in<p>


<b>++ Page 404</b><p>

numerous loans, each exceeding Rs. 25,000, and totaling almost
Rs. 4.5 million; and hundreds of smaller loans of an unknown sum;
many hundred shops financing and conducting trade in various
products; and several processing plants and factories. Though
these were concentrated in the Central Provinces, especially in
or near Jabalpur district, others were dispersed in Bombay,
Rajasthan, Central India, the Punjab, the United Provinces,
Calcutta, and Rangoon.<p>

 The extent of Gokuldas' economic control and his monopoly varied
with location, the product, and the period of time. For some
products such as wheat and cotton, he sought to control a corner
of the production of the raw materials, to profit from their sale
and trade, L to transport a portion to his factories for
processing or manufacture, and to return the finished products
for sale in his shops or in <p> E return for more raw materials.
By at least 1880 he was
well aware that ownership of village lands not only symbolized
traditional status and power, but also provided direct and
immediate access to its food, forest and dairy production.
Through various economic control methods (mainly loans) in many
of his villages he was able to acquire much of his tenants'
produce from their fields. <A NAME="rf404.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N404.1"><SUP>404.1</SUP></a>  
It is not surprising, therefore, that
he raised strong objections in 1894 when the government initiated
a policy for the recovery of rent payments in cash and prohibited
their recovery in kind. He eventually abandoned a suit against
government over this issue, however, when the government<p>

<b>++ Page 405</b><p>

explained that he could recover rents in kind, but only if the
produce was calculated at rates equal to current market prices or
even more favorable to the tenant. 
<A NAME="rf405.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N405.1"><SUP>405.1</SUP></a><p>

Gokuldas' position in some trade markets was as complete as in
his access to land produce. One such market was Gadarwara, one of
the largest speculative wheat markets in the Nerbudda valley.
Among the 200-300 brokers at the market the Gokuldas firm was
considered the largest. In 1884 other brokers began making
contracts for large quantities of grain with the firm. As demand
far exceeded the normal supply, it appeared that a large number
of brokers would benefit by selling at higher prices at the
expense of Gokuldas. Instead he met the demand by purchasing and
supplying grain to the market from various other localities. m e
local Gadarwara brokers, who would have lost considerably had
Gokuldas not intervened, were spared serious loss. A similar
incident occurred at the cotton market at Amraoti. Gokuldas'
biographer reported the comment, "In the same way anybody who
took it into his head to compete with the Raja Sahib, had to eat
humble pie.&quot; 
<A NAME="rf405.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N405.2"><SUP>405.2</SUP></a> 
The circle of Gokuldas' conglomerate control
was completed with his establishment and ownership of numerous
wheat mills and plants to press cotton and manufacture cloth.<p>

<b>++Page 406</b><p>

Gokuldas could buy or obtain grain and cotton from a tenant, sell
him food and flour, loan him seed when he needed it, and provide
him some cloth all &quot;to the mere profit of the
middlemen&quot; - - that is Gokuldas and his agents. 
<A NAME="rf406.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N406.1"><SUP>406.1</SUP></a> As a
landlord, trader, banker, and industrialist, Gokuldas had access
to a certain amount of products and control over its supply,
processing, manufacture, and sale.  As such he also controlled a
certain number of producers, suppliers,and consumers. 
<A NAME="rf406.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N406.2"><SUP>406.2</SUP></a><p>

Gokuldas' &quot;territorial&quot; expansion and consolidation in
land,lending, trade and industry, and his intensification of that
control were accomplished through a management structure, which
resembled the structure of the government in many ways. He was at
the head,surrounded by a &quot;council of ministers,&quot; under
whom agents conducted the affairs of the kingdom's subjects. At
each of the three levels of his administration, the personnel had
particular characteristics or qualifications that led to their
selection, training, and functions.He, like other members of the
family dynasty, received a privileged education and special
training. Particularly under the guidance of the family's rulers,
he learned the basic business skills, and<p>

<b>++ Page 407</b><p>

accounting methods, and was proficient in the Marwari language in
which he transacted his business. He also acquired certain social
and religious attitudes as he grew up in the &quot;court&quot; at
the family's Jabalpur residence, later to be known as the
&quot;Raja Gokuldas Palace.&quot;When he inherited the headship
of the a~ministration, he continued the tradition of close,
personal supervision of the firm's management and activities.
Usually each year, he spent nine months on tour inspecting his
shops, estates, and other establishments and giving advice to his
personnel.<p>

At the headquarters at Jabalpur, he conducted business in
consultation with members of the second level of his
administration-treasurers, head-clerks, managers, advisors, and
lawyers. Most of his &quot;council&quot; had specialized
training, and performed specific functions for the firm.
Punamchand's family had served the firm for three generations
mainly as treasurers. S. R. Chaudhri came to Jabalpur after legal
training at Calcutta and handled technical aspects of drawing-up
contracts, petitions, and law-suits for the firm. The Russell
brothers managed various affairs, after retiring from many years
of service in the British administration.<p>

Unlike the diverse social and cultural background among the
personnel of the second level, almost all those on the third
level were selected from a single social category--Marwaris--and
were selected because of their educational and linguistic
qualifications as much as because they were Marwaris. (Similarly
the British government justified its selection of Englishmen for
administrative positions in India.) As Marwaris, the <i>munims</i>
or agents usually had<p>

<b>++ Page 408</b><p>

acquired a training in basic accounting methods, certain business
attitudes, and a knowledge of the Marwari language and script
from their families before they were selected. Gokuldas
controlled his agents by means of several requirements. They had
to pass through a probationary period at Jabalpur so he could
assess their character and skills. They were then posted to some
shop or position where he could examine and reassess their work
when on tour. Like members of the British administration, most
agents were transferred from one post to another at intervals of
3 to 4 years, often without any notice. No relatives or members
of the same <i>jati</i> of the agent were appointed to the same
locality. 
<A NAME="rf408.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N408.1"><SUP>408.1</SUP></a>
Gokuldas communicated with his agents in Marwari--and
his handwriting and style made it difficult for anyone except his
own agents to decipher his messages.<p>

His methods of accounting and conduct of business, though
accepted and understood by other Indians, especially other
Marwaris, appeared unusual, unsystematic, and unbusiness-like to
the British who had been trained in and were accustomed to other
procedures.One British official, visiting Gokuldas at his
residence to ask him to transfer a large amount of money to
another location, described the simplicity and off-handed manner
in which Gokuldas conducted the exchange. After arriving at the
&quot;palace&quot; he was shown into Gokuldas'&quot;garden, a
large lawn surrounded with blossoming shrubs, a fountain playing
in the middle, and a peafowl lazily strutting about.&quot; A<p>

<b>++ Page 409</b><p>

superior &quot;henchman&quot; entertained the official until the
&quot;great man&quot; appeared and seated himself.<p>


<blockquote>It would be untactful to start away on business as the chief 
motive of the visit, though the motive is tacitly understood.  So
we exchange the usual elaborate greetings in the hyperbole of
Hindustani--for the great man knows no English. Then general
topics, such as the weather, crop prospects, the probability of
epidemic disease in the city; and I rake inquiry about the Raja's
stables, a favorite subject . . . Meanwhile the fountain plays . .
. and time slips away. Then at last the question comes--Is there
any service which the Sahib wishes done?  I reply that there is a
trifling matter, a little money to be -emitted. The great-man
beckons an attendant, who removes the sack without counting coin
or notes. That doesn't matter; I know it will be all right.More
compliments and talk. The attendant reappears with the sack, now
empty. We ignore him and continue the leisurely talk, till the
Raja asks in feigned surprise, as though he had forgotten all
about it, whether we hadn't some small business to do. Ah yes;
here it is. He takes a tiny scrap of paper from the attendant and
hands it to me. All it contains are a few hieroglyph ~cs in the
obscure Marwari script. This I pocket with ostentatious
negligence, well knowing that in a few days- I shall receive an
acknowledgment from the British bank in the capital of a
neighboring province . 
<A NAME="rf409.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N409.1"><SUP>409.1</SUP></a> 
</blockquote>

Several of the British laws, regulations, and concepts of
business, no doubt, appeared as strange to Gokuldas as his
business procedures appeared to the British. Most of his 
petitions ended with an apology for his inadequate 
understanding of British laws and occasional
incorrect use of the English language.<p>

As the Gokuldas kingdom developed into a large and wealthy
power in the nineteenth century, he turned to establishing
&quot;diplomatic&quot;'
relations with two types of other powers. One had dominion and
control over religious affairs. On his pilgrimages he paid tribute to
the<p>

<b>++ Page 410</b><p>

local Brahmin priests through gifts and feasts in return for
religious recognition and merit. The second grew out of his-
association with various &quot;Princely States,&quot; especially
in Rajasthan. He made ceremonial visits to these rulers and in
return, in Rajasthan in particular, he received honorary
recognition of his position ant privileged concessions for any
business established there. Such &quot;treaty&quot;concessions
often stipulated not only that he would be awarded financial
preference in economic activities, but that his shops and books
would be free from investigation and his employees would be
exempt from criminal prosecution.  
<A NAME="rf410.1"></A>
<A HREF="#N410.1"><SUP>410.1</SUP></a><p>

The major political power Gokuldas had to deal with was the
British Raj. During the prosperous decades of the late nineteenth
century, he aided the British and collaborated in several
activities such as loans to previously important families of the
Central Provinces (through the Court of Wards), and the financing
of railway construction and municipal waterworks. The British
honored him with titles which admitted him to the category of a
privileged person,exempt from personal appearances in the low
court, and from the prohibitions of the Arms Act. On one occasion
he took advantage of this privileged status when he prohibited
local police from entering and searching the house of his trusted
treasurer, Punamchand, when t was discovered a deposit was
missing from his treasury. <A NAME="rf410.2"></A>
<A HREF="#N410.2"><SUP>410.2</SUP></a><p>

<b>++ Page 411</b><p>

This privileged relationship with the British became modified in
the last years of the nineteenth century and the first years of
the twentieth. As long as Gokuldas' domains remained mainly
within financial and commercial areas-, British interference
remained at minimum. Because of their original experience as a
trading company in India and because of their intellectual
inheritance of concepts of laissez-faire economics, the British
remained reluctant to interfere drastically and decisively in
trade, banking and business. On the other hand, land policy
remained a paramount concern of the British. Gokuldas' increasing
involvement and ownership of land and his membership in a
commercial caste, brought his landlord role to the attention of
the local administration and caused major disagreements between
the two. The revision of the thirty-year land revenue settlement
and the decline in agricultural prosperity late in the late
nineteenth century compelled the British to reconsider their land
policies. The British became involved in the equitable fixation
of rents; in the retention of subsistence land for landlords who
were indebted, and who would otherwise have to sell their land;
in the remission and abatement of land revenue, and finally in
debt conciliation. Each of these policy developments impinged on
Cokuldas' land domain in some way. His approach to them differed
from the government's new policies. (See Chapter VII on Land.) As
soon as the attention of Gokuldas' relationship with the British
shifted to his landlord activities rather than his commercial and
banking activities, differences between the two mounted. In
addition, the shift of politics from one of prosperity, where all
parties benefited<p>

<b>++ Page 412</b><p>

in some way from economic growth, to a politics of scarcity
because of the famines further aggravated the relationship. His
petitions are evidences of the discussions and debates he had
with the government.<p>

The establishment of British control successively over
various territories in India during the late eighteenth and in
the nineteenth century changed the rules and the nature of the
political game of dominance and control. They were able to define
the broad limits within which Indians could function and
participate. But these limits were both exclusive and inclusive
of various kinds of activity. The dominance was never intended to
cover all activities of all Indians. In the internal commercial
domain the British followed a policy generally to free the flow
of trade, abolishing the taxes and tariffs of previous
governments. In the domain of land control, the British also
intended to limit their direct interference only to a certain
local level. Below
that level the taxed producer or landholder was to have his own
domain, the freedom to improve agricultural production on his own
profits and initiative. Under the British rules of the political
game, the British at times succeeded in attracting Indians to
collaborate with them in their inclusive spheres of dominance. To
such participants and supporters, the government awarded symbolic
titles and recognized privileged status. However,in the spheres
freed from British dominance, many Indians maintained their
position and practices or even expanded their control. Under the
British rules they learned how to play the game and set up
their own spheres of dominance, excluded from British control or
at least <p>

<b>++ Page 413</b><p>

from constant interference.<p>

In the Central Provinces, several Indians played the new
political game. The Gokuldas family was an exceptional example of
the establishment, expansion and consolidation of a commercial
kingdom. As we have seen, they cooperated with the British in
certain enterprises and institutions. Jabalpur became the second
largest town in the province after only a century, primarily
through the combined efforts: of the British and the prominent
contribution of the Gokuldas family to the economic and public
life of the town.<p>

During the same period, other families in the Central
Provinces developed and expanded their own spheres of dominance,
built their own structure of control, and legitimized their
position by various symbols. At Nagpur, the Chitnavis family was
one of several families who utilized their recent position under
the Bhonslas and their landed estates to expand into commerce,
industry, and participation in British constitutional reforms.
Also at Nagpur, the Maheshwari family of Abhirchand typified a
commercial and banking expansion similar to the Gokuldas family
but without the extensive investment in landownership. The
Kanhayalal family of Raipur Agarwals and the Bhaiyalal Chaudhri
family of Jabalpur Jains also represent expansion of commercial
domains with a moderate interest in land investment. The
Bhuskutte family of Hoshangabad Maratha Brahmins more 
closely approximated the Chitnavis type of expansion. These 
are just a few families in the Central Provinces during this 
period who successfully
played the game of power and prestige under the British
definitions of inclusive and exclusive spheres of dominance. Like
the Gokuldas<p>

<b>++ Page 414</b><p>

family they formulated their own policy, devised
their own management structure, and utilized particular
categories of
resource personnel within their &quot;kingdoms.&quot; The
personnel incorporated within their management structures often
consisted of highly trained&quot;foreigners&quot; (migrants into
the Central Provinces) at the top, and fellow-caste personnel in
the middle and lower ranks. By their activities these families
simultaneously expanded their own type of control in spheres of
domain outside British interest and interference, and accepted
their limited role in the spheres of domain that were
included-under direct British control.<p>

In these pages, we have surveyed a part of the history
of nineteenth century Central Provinces when there were new
factors and participants in the political and economic activity
of the area.Because of their cultural and intellectual inclinations,
the British excluded particular domains from their predominant
and pervasive control such as private business? trade, and local
landed estates.In these some Indian families, from diverse areas
and backgrounds,were quick to establish their control. Throughout
the nineteenth century both the new British and Indian
participants expanded and intensified their control over their
own separate domains. Yet there was a degree of interaction
represented by such activities as the government's taxation of
landed estates, a few cooperative economic enterprises, inclusion
of Indians in subordinate positions in administration, and
symbolic awards for support. As long as the Central Provinces
faced no severe economic decline and government 
policy remained fairly consistent, these collaborative efforts
worked<p>

<b>++ Page 415</b><p>

to the mutual benefit of the new co--existing domains. But, late
in the nineteenth century, the government began to reconsider the
degree of its involvement in the domain of local
landholders, and at the same time famines brought new economic
conditions. Consequently disagreements arose between the British
and Indians over the changed economic conditions and land
policy.<p>

 The history of the Gokuldas dynasty provides one of the
most successful examples of these types of economic, political?
and social developments in the Central Provinces, Though
beginning
as a small trading and banking enterprise based in Jabalpur, the
family expanded into a conglomerate enterprise in the domains
outside of direct British government interest and control; they
increased their wealth, intensified their control, diversified
their activities and extended them into several areas of India,
and received symbolic recognition of their position from both the
British rulers and Indian princes. By the time of his death in
1909, Gokuldas had clearly shown that his title as
&quot;Raja&quot; was more than honorific.<p>

took payments in kind at prices favorable to themselves. That is,
the government wanted to end <i>de facto</i> rent enhancements By
landlords at the time of collecting rent payments in kind.

His prominent position in the establishment and ownership of
industry in Jabalpur allowed him to acquire cheap workers during
the famines. The large number of orphans created by the famine
caused a problem for the government. They preferred to place them
under Hindu care, even though Christian Missions were always
willing to accept the orphans. In 1896, with government approval,
if not gratitude,Gokuldas took over the care of all the orphans
in the town, many of them were employed in his mills. See
