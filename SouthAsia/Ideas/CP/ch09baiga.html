The Baigas were one of several tribal people in the Central Provinces.
In the first provincial census (1866), aboriginal and hill tribes formed
one-fifth of the population of nine million.  Gonds accounted for almost
three-fourths of these tribal people, while the remainder included
Baigas, Korkus, Bhils, Kols, and others. Most lived on the middle spine
of the Satpura hills, with its plateaus and valleys, which divided the
province between the northern, southern, and southeastern plains.
Baigas, along with some of the Gonds, occupied the Maikal range of the
eastern Satpura hills. The heavily forested and sparsely populated range
gave rise to streams and rivers that flowed in all direction. The
Narbudda and its tributaries flowed west; and tributaries of the
Wainganga emerged to join that river as it flowed south into the
Godavari. In these highlands were, the boundaries of three
administrative districts of the Central Provinces well as the boundary
between the province and Rewa State. At times the area was referred to
as Baigadesh, Baiga-country.<p>

As described by several British administrators in the 1860s, the Baigas
were viewed as the wildest and most isolated tribal people. The Satpura
hills with its forests and sparse population was of major interest to
the British because of their policies of taxation on forest and
agricultural produce, forest conservation, and possible colonization by
European and Indian settlers. British officers explored the area in

The provincial census of 1866 enumerated about 16,000 Baigas, while an estimate in 1869
of 18,000 Baigas closely approximated the census statistics. Most lived in the eastern part of
the Mandla and Seoni districts (10,388and 3,907 respectively). <A NAME="rf418.1"></A>

Sports (London: Chapman and Hall, 1871), p. 359. The census was taken the evening of

lived outside the Central Provinces in adjacent Rewa State. Enumerations of Baigas in the
1860s or since should be considered as approximations for several reasons. Not all Baigas
accepted that designation; other tribes and people had similar names. Baigas could consider
themselves as Narotrias, Barotrias, Binjhwars, or Bhumias-all endogamous Baiga group
names. Bhumia had other meanings. Baiga considered themselves Bhumia or "lords of the
soil." In addition, Bhumia and Baiga were both occupational titles of non-Hindu village
priests in the area, even hen the priests belonged to another tribe or caste. Binjhwar and
other names might also refer to other tribes, separate from the Baiga.<a

British observers felt the Baigas had migrated into Baigadesh from the east many centuries
before, probably much before the more numerous Gonds who established political control
over the highlands around the fourteenth century.. Hindu villagers viewed the Baigas as the
original inhabitants and accepted their decisions in boundary disputes.<a

Baiga myths also support their claim to long residence in the upland forests. Baiga ideology
is revealed especially in two myths--one on creation and another on their role in the
world.<p>

Bhagwan (God) first created a man and a woman in his upper world. They were formed
from the dirt which had settled on his body during a twelve year fast. Their names were
Naga Baiga and Naga Baigin. They want to live in the middle world where there was only
water and rock. In order to bring fertile earth to the middle world, four animal-god
companions were ordered to go to the underworld and bring back Dhartia Mata or fertile
soil. After many difficulties they found their way to the under-world, and met Dhartia Mata,
who agreed to be swallowed by the companions if they would worship her. But the serpent
king of the underworld discovered them as they stole away, and had Dhartia Mata squeezed
out of them, ordering them to return to the middle world. By chance, a small speck of
Dhartia Meta remained lodged in the teeth of one of the companions, and this was taken and
churned with the drops of nectar or liquor from the <U>mahua</U> tree in a large caldron.
The soil expanded, spilling over and starting to cover the middle earth, but she slipped and
rocked and it was feared she would escape back to the underworld. To steady her, Naga<p>

[<b>Page 420</b>]<p>

Baiga was called, but as he was naked he would not come out of the water. He was offered
a large cloth which he wrapped around his huge body, but it barely covered his loins.
Dhartia Mata liked Naga Baiga and agreed to serve him and remain in the middle world, if
he would worship and sacrifice to her. He agreed. "Nails" were replaced in the soil, and they
and the guardianship and worship of Dhartia Mata by the Baiga have since the kept fertile
earth steady to grow crops and trees.<a name="rf420.1"></a><A
HREF="#N_420.1_"><SUP>(420.1)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="420.1. These
myths are reported in several places including Tribes and Castes, and Elwin, Baiga.This
version is from a Dewar of Bijora near Dindor, as recorded in Stephen Fuchs, The Gond
and Bhumia of Eastern Mandla, 2d. ed. (Bombay: New Literature Publishing Company,
1968), pp. 414-427. Naga (snake) Baiga is often called Nanga (naked) Baiga. Some of the
these myths are in A. Bloomfield,<U>Notes on the Baigas of Central India [Nagpur: 1885],
p. 2."><p>

Naga Baiga and Naga Baigin had two sons who married their sisters; from their children
the world was populated. The elder son's children were the Baigas ; the younger son's were
the Gonds and others. <p>

Bhagwan also decided how the Baigas would live. When Bhagwan "called all the tribes of
the world together to make a king" over middle earth, he<p>

<blockquote>first chose the Baiga. But Naga Baiga begged that the Gond, his brother,
might be king in his place. Bhagavan was pleased at this request, and, as a mark of his
favour took Naga Baiga by the hand and placed him on his throne by his side. He granted
his prayer to make the Gond king, but he gave the Baiga an even greater blessing.<p>

"All the kingdoms of the world," he said, "my fall to pieces, but he who is made of earth
and is Bhumia raja, lord of the earth, shall never forsake it. You will make your living from
the earth. You will dig roots and eat them.You will cut wood and carry it on your
shoulders. Your wife will pick leaves and sell them. You must not tear the breasts of your
Mother the Earth with the plough like the Gond and Hindu. You will cut down trees and
burn them and sow your seed in the ashes. But you will never become rich, for if you did
you would forsake the earth, and then there would be no one to guard it and keep its nails in
place." Then Bhagavan showed Naga Baiga how to cut bewar and sow seed in the ashes of
burnt trees; and [<b>Page 421</b>] when he had taught him everything, he called him to
receive gifts of seed.<a name="rf421.1"></a><A

The ideology represented in these myths formed the basis for many Baiga beliefs, attitudes,
and practices. It defined their role in the world--as guardians of the forest and the soil. They
would enjoy the produce of the forest and grow crops by shifting cultivation in the forest
(cutting <U>bewar</U>) but would never be rich. While related to the Gonds, the Baiga
considered Gonds "inferior," as <U>kisans</U> or farmers making use of the plough to
"tear" Mother Earth outside the forest. The "nails" perhaps represent trees, which the Baiga
would guard to keep the soil in place. Because they did not use a plow on the slopes of hills,
and permitted forest re-growth, they would prevent denudation and erosion of the land.<p>

Between the 1860s and the mid-1880s, British administrators observed and described most
of the basic customs and practices of the Beige. A. Bloomfield, who was the District
Commissioner of Balaghat for several years, presented the fullest account in his <U>Notes
on the Baigas</U>, published in 1885. One of his reports listed several ways the Baiga
obtained their living:<p>

<blockquote>1. By cutting bewar and growing crops.<br>2. By hunting and fishing.<br>3.
By collecting forest roots and fruits.<br>4. By labor for others.<br>5. By collecting and
selling forest produce such as honey and harra (myrabaloms).<br>6. By making and selling
bamboo mats and baskets. <br>7. By serving as village priests, practicing exorcism and
herbalism.<a name="rf421.2"></a><A

422</b>]<p>

The most important of these was growing grain and vegetables on plots i.e. bewars, cleared
in the forest, supplemented by food gathering and hunting. Each activity had seasonal
importance rather than being full-time activity. Only some Baigas obtained their living
through the last four methods.<p>

In cutting <U>bewar</U>, the axe was the most important implement. The Baigas annual
cycle of activity began in the months of January and February. The Baiga, sometimes
accompanied by village elders, would select a site, called a bewar, for clearing the forest.
The best sites contained a thick growth of trees and brush on the slope of a hill above the
frost line. Such a site would provide sufficient ash fertilizer, drainage, and prevent frost
damage to late maturing crops. Some Baigas made offerings of mahua or other materials to
honor the forest spirits and Dhartia Mata, before they began to cut the bewar and later
before sowing the seeds. A Baiga male could cut and clear three to eight acres in two
months.<a name="rf421.2"></a><A
HREF="#N_422.1_"><SUP>(422.1)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="422.1. The
bewar method of cultivation was described by many writers, but see especially Bloomfield,
Notes, pp. 14-16, and Daya Shankar Nag, Tribal Economy: An Economic Study of the
Baiga (Delhi: Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sang, 1958), pp. 62-75. Nag suggests the annual
cycle of bewar."> <p>

Between February and May the wood was left to dry. During this time, the Baiga
supplemented his grain diet through other activities. Baigas, especially the sub-tribe of
Barotrias of eastern Balaghat, were famous for their skill in hunting, tracking, and trapping.
They used bows and poisoned arrows made of bamboo, and various types of traps, to hunt
and kill small animals such as the smaller deer, wild pigs, porcupines, rabbits and birds.<a

arrowroot, until the ground was too dry and hard for digging. in late March and April the
forest mahua tree (<U>Bassia latifolia</U>) blossomed and the fruit was gathered to be
boiled or dried as food. Pressed mahua seeds produced oil; and the petals were used to
ferment liquor. The mahua was thus an important source of food during the hottest and
driest months of the year; it was also a source for oil used both for cooking and for lamps,
and liquor made from petals was essential for rituals and relaxation.<p>

By late May the Baiga fired the dry wood of the bewar. The fire was lit where the first tree
had been cut, and started from the friction of bamboo sticks and tinder, After the ashes
cooled, the Baiga spread them evenly over the bewar and planted the seeds. <U>Kutki</U>,
a millet, was the main grain crop along with some <U>mandi</U>. Cucumber, gourd, beans
and other seeds were planted around the tree stumps.<p>

From the beginning of the rains in June through September, the crops were protected and
weeded. The Baiga built a fence around the bewar and a small, open thatched hut
(<U>machan</U>) near the bewar. For the fence, trees and brush were closely interwoven,
leaving only a few small openings were traps were laid. The machan provided shelter for the
Baiga and perhaps his wife. A fire kept animals away at night. During the day the crops were
weeded. Some food gathering, and fishing in pools formed by dams up-stream, also
occupied the Baigas at intervals during the monsoon months.<a name="rf423.1"></a><A

September to December were months of harvest, thrashing and storage.<p>

[<b>Page 424</b>]<p>

The grain was cut near the top leaving the stalks for next season's burning. It was threshed
under foot, winnowed, and carried back to the village for storage.<p>

In January and February the annual cycle began again. The same plot produced less the
second year and further declined the third year. The old bewar was then allowed to lie fallow
for tree regrowth during the next ten to fifteen years, before being cut again.<p>

While Baigas practiced bewar, Goods practiced another form of cultivation called
<U>dhya</U>. Unlike bewar, Gonds cut wood and shrubs from the forest nearby, brought
it to dry on the plot and later burned it; then they plowed the ashes into the soil. Baigas said
they never practiced dhya as it permanently destroyed the forest areas on the more level
ground below the frost line. One estimate of Good cultivators in 1869 indicates about half of
the Gonds practiced plow cultivation, one-fourth dhya and one-fourth a combination of the
two.<a name="rf424.1"></a><A name="424.1"></a><a name="rf"></a><A

The only estimates of bewar productivity were made by A. Bloomfield--once in 1869 and
again in 1885.Bloomfield indicated a bewar (ranging from three to eight acres) was
extremely productive, yet not enough to feed a whole Baiga family. (See table.) The major
crop of kutki, produced about 10 <U>khandis</U> from one <U>kuro</U>(1/20th of a
khandi) of seed sown. This 200-fold productivity fell to 160-180-fold in the second year and
dropped to 40-60-fold in the third year. A male adult consumed about six<p>

khandis in a year, so the remaining four khandis was insufficient for another male or for his
wife and children and other relatives. Besides its use as food, there were other costs. About
one khandi would be needed to pay the administration a tax of one rupee on each axe, and
for the depreciation of the axe. (Axes cost one-quarter rupee and lasted about six years). In
addition one kuro of it was kept as seed for the next year's crop. Clearly while the bewar
provided a major source of grain food for the family, the hunting and food gathering
activities and garden crops were essential to sustain Baigas.<p>

Besides these sources of food the early accounts mention the sacrifice and consumption of
several domestic animals--chickens, goats, and pigs. A few of these evidently were raised in
the village for eggs, milk and meat.They were killed and eaten only on rare or special
occasions. Cattle ere too expensive for Baigas to keep because they easily succumbed to
diseases, or to tiger and panther attacks. Later accounts also mention small
gardens(<U>baris</U>), behind houses, specially attended and fertilized with dung, and
growing small amounts of vegetables, spices, maize (corn), and tobacco. <a

Some Baiga worked in other activities either to supplement their income or to obtain a
living. Some Baiga, especially women, worked as agricultural laborers, particularly to help
harvest wheat and autumn crops as they ripened during the Baigas slack season of February
and March. Others contracted to cut timber or to collect forest produce such as harra. At
times Baigas also collected honey and sold it. One survey<p>

in 1888 investigated the earnings of a Baiga family in Balaghat District, who made bamboo
baskets to earn money to buy food. The family consisted of the Baiga, his wife and two
small children. They made twelve baskets a week, selling each for two pounds of rice or
millet. The earnings of 100 pounds of unhusked grain, or less than one rupee per month was
supplemented by the collection of forest roots and fruits. They saved about one rupee each
year for clothing.<a name="rf428.1"></a><A

Finally, a few Baigas earned a living as herb specialists and priests. They conducted
ceremonies for villagers, exorcised spirits, and prescribed herbal remedies. One or two Baiga
priests became famous and received windfall earnings. A Baiga was paid Rs. 80 in 1867 to
exorcise cholera from the town of Mandla.<a name="428.2"></a><A

Most Baiga, however, were not famous or wealthy; nor skilled specialists--except in their
practice of bewar cutting, hunting, and food getting. They generally lived on the forested

Although British descriptions of the 1860s stressed the Baigas' self-sufficiency, Baigas had
some contact and exchange with the outside world. Peddlers visited villages and some Baigas
went to local market or bazaars. The Baigas would buy salt, poison, cloth, and axes in
exchange for forest produce. Some salt, however, was available as deposit in a type of
bamboo and in clay.<a name="rf429.3"></a><A

him out at once. He generally brings a few mats or baskets which he has made, or fruit,
collected, for sale, and with the sum (a few pice or annas at the most) he proceeds to make
his weekly purchases, changing his pice into cowrie shells, of which he receives eighty for
each one. He buys tobacco, salt, chillies and other sundries, besides as much

As already described, Baiga religious practices included sacrifices to Dhartia Mats, the
forest and other spirits.Group ceremonies included songs and dances on special occasions.
The Karma dance was particularly popular.Women linked arms in one line facing a similar
line of man, and in between a drum beat out the rhythm. Each group alternately sang out the
song's witty and romantic verses which were answered by the other. In turn, the group
singing approached the other, retreating at the end of the verse. Each group swayed to the
rhythm and approached the other as they sang. The rhythm slowly increased until there was
rapid dancing at the end of the song.<a name="rf430.2"></a><A

In 1883 several hundred Baigas performed the Karma at Baihar, when the Lord Bishop of
Calcutta visited them.Bloomfield felt this dance originally was performed only on the
occasion when a Baiga had been possessed by Ganshiam, but now was performed on any
occasion. Only two cases of possession had occurred in recent years--Lashkar Barotia of

the upper Wainganga valley, some Binjhwar Baigas practiced settled agriculture, and
appeared to have less belief in the Baiga bewar legend. In contrast almost all the Barotria
Baigas of the eastern forests practiced bewar on the hills and had pride in their hunting skills
with the bow and arrow. Narotrias of the middle area believed in most of the distinctive
Baiga myths and practiced bewar in the hills overlooking the valleys of the upper Nahar,

Based on observations and descriptions of the Baigas in the middle of the nineteenth
century, the Baiga tribe had developed a close relationship with the highland forest
environment of central India in which they lived. Their ideology, represented in their myths,
gave them a proud and separate identity. It provided the basis for living in an often
dangerous, hostile, and precarious forest environment through the cultivation of bewar,
hunting and food gathering. It reinforced their reliance on the Forest; that they would not
become wealthy, but could survive if they maintained, conserved, and revived the forest, and
honored the fertile soil or Dhartia Mata who gave them life.<p>

<a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border=0 align=middle></a><p>

British rule threatened to change or even destroy many practices of the Baigas and other
forest tribes. British administrators expressed both an admiration and strong disapproval of
the Baiga and other forest cultivators.Baiga practices, customs and beliefs contrasted sharply
with dominant Western and Indian cultures. Between1861 and 1921 the relationship
between the British and the Baigas became a struggle of the British on the one hand, trying
to change the Baigas from forest cultivators to settled farmers, and the Baigas, on the other
hand, trying to retain their culture and searching for ways to survive under new
administrative and economic conditions.<p>

[<b>Page 433</b>]<p>

The British felt their policy to transform the Baiga way of living would have several
benefits. First, valuable forests would be preserved under British management. Second, land
could be brought under cultivation and improved. Third, the Baigas themselves would be
taught a more suitable and productive way of living. While British policy remained broadly
consistent during the six decades, their programs and methods were varied and sporadic. At
times prohibitions alternated with incentives; several times British administrators became
more involved in other activities which meant ignoring or disregarding Baiga interests. This
is especially exemplified in the formation of the new district of Balaghat in 1867.<p>

In the 1860a British administrators were actively involved in establishing British rule all
over the Central Provinces but mainly in the densely populated and agriculturally productive
areas. In the more sparsely-populated and forested areas, such as the area where the Baigas
lived, the British concentrated on introducing basic and minimal forms of administration and
promoting program of forest management and colonization. The creation of Balaghat district
in 1867 exemplified some of the goals and actions undertaken by the British in the area.<p>

Balaghat district was created specifically for three purposes: to manage and collect revenue,
including that from the forests; to construct and improve roads between the plains and the
uplands; and to promote "the establishment in the uphill tracts of well-to-do settlers from the
low lying tracts."<a name="rf433.1"></a><A

src="blue.gif" alt="434.1. Bloomfield, Progress, p. 87,par. 2."><p>

The formation of this district in 1867 was a culmination of earlier British policies and
activities in the area. In1862 Chief Commissioner Temple hadthought the hills of the
Central Provinces possessed great potentials for colonization and forest production.
<U>Sal</U> trees grew "in greatest abundance in the Districts of the Satpura Range."There
were many sal forests "of great richness and still untouched," which would "now be
preserved."<a name="rf434.2"></a><A
HREF="#N_434.2_"><SUP>(434.2)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="434.2. Central
Provinces, Report on the Administration of the Central Provinces up to August 1862, by
Richard Temple (1862; reprinted., Nagpur: Government Press, 1923), p. 93, par. 455."> On
the topic of European colonization in unoccupied or sparsely populated lands, Temple said it
was "difficult . . . to do justice to this topic, so full of interest and hope for the future." He
wanted to acquire government ownership of"eligible localities without delay or trouble" and
begin construction of roads into the isolated areas.<a name="rf434.3"></a><A
HREF="#N_434.3_"><SUP>(434.3)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="434.3. Ibid., p.
92, par. 451."><p>

First, the "eligible localities" had to be discovered. In 1863, W. B. Thomson reported on a
large area of the uplands called the Bichia-Raigarh tract of eastern Seoni district. As the
Land Revenue Settlement Officer of Seoni district, Thomson had recently toured and
explored the area in order to gather information on its geography, population, and economic
potentials. He thought tea and coffee plantations could be established in some of the area
and cattle ranches in other places. The<p>

[<b>Page 435</b>]<p>

main obstacles to European colonization might be its isolation, lack of communications,
and scarcity of labor. To solve these problems he recommended road construction and the
immigration of labor. His detailed report along with a short summary by Temple was
published in the <U>Government Gazette</U> of March 1864 with the hope of informing
and attracting European settlers <a name="rf435.1"></a><A
HREF="#N_435.1_"><SUP>(435.1)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="435.1. Thomas,
Report, and India, Gazette--1864, pp. 127-137. "><p>

Second, the government needed to acquire title to land suitable for colonization and forest
improvements. Like other districts of the Central Provinces, Mandla and Seoni districts were
being surveyed, assessed, and a landrevenue determined in the 1860s. By 1865 Thomson
had classified land as either agricultural and non-agricultural, also called "waste" land, in the
Bichia-Raigarh tract. In an area of 1356.5 square miles with S89inhabited and uninhabited
villages, he thought only 186 square miles of 68 villages could be considered agricultural
land. He classified over 86 percent of the area (1170.6 square miles) with 521 villages as
"waste" or government land.<a name="rf435.2"></a><A
HREF="#N_435.2_"><SUP>(435.2)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="435.2. W. B.
Thomson, Statement showing details of cultivation and waste, etc. in the Raigurh Tract, in
IFP, March 1866, General #30, pp. 48-49.">In recommending Thomson's proposals, the
Settlement Commissioner, John Morris, emphasized that "the tract to be reserved as
excluded Government waste will be very large."Since most of the land consisted "of very
superior land, with first-rate soil and excellent pasturage, covered in portions with very
valuable forests and admirably adapted in other ways, from situation and climate for
European settlers, the question of the measures necessary<p>

[<b>Page 436</b>]<p>

for reclaiming the same becomes one of considerable importance."<a

General #29, p. 42, par. 4">Morris recommended that the explored tract along with sow
adjacent plains of Bhandara district be formed under a separate administration to ensure its
improvement.<p>

Morris, like Thomson before him and other British officials later, expressed two reasons
why tribal forest cultivators should not be allowed to occupy or have land rights in the
reserved government waste land. First, he thought they destroyed valuable forests, and
second, they did not cultivate and settle in what Morris considered the best land. He
described the tract as a "howling wilderness" in spite of "the extreme fertility of the soil and
its great natural capabilities." He said<p>

 <blockquote>For miles not a habitation is to be seen whilst its only regular inhabitants are the wild
Gonds and Baigas, who make no effort to reclaim the fertile virgin soil, and destroy the
valuable sal forests by <U>dhya</U> cultivation."<a name="rf436.2"></a><a
HREF="#N_436.2_"><SUP> (436.2)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="436.2. Ibid., p.

Thomson, in his final report on the land revenue settlement of Seoni, again described how
and why he had decided to classify so large an area as reserved government waste and so
small an area as agricultural land. He left instructions that the tribal population in the
reserved government waste lands should be notified and moved into the agricultural villages

[<b>Page 437</b>]<p>

Bichia-Raigarh tract, the Land Revenue Settlement Officer, H. C. E. Ward, generally
followed the same procedures as Thomson, classifying most of the area as government waste
land. However in twelve Baiga villages, he allowed them to continue bewars.<a

As a result of the land revenue proceedings in Bichia-Raigarh and Mandla district, about
7491 square miles were classified as government waste. All of this or 5010 square miles in
Mandla district was made available for sale or lease, though only 860 square miles or 17.2
percent were considered cultivatable. In Balaghat 13 percent of the waste land was made
available for allotment.<a name="rf437.2"></a><a

areas of the two districts after the founding of Balaghat district. Bichia was added to Mandla
district, and the larger Raigarh tract formed the northern part of Balaghat. Southern Balaghat
consisted of the northern plains of Bhandara district.<p>

As created in the late 1860s, Balaghat district included two very different sub-units: the
densely-populated plains called Balaghat tahsil, and the sparsely-populated uplands or Baihar
tahsil. British administrators had decided to unite these two areas under one district
administration to facilitate the immigration of farmers from the plains to the uplands.<p>

In 1869, the Deputy Commissioner of Balaghat, A. Bloomfield, reported on the progress
of programs. Three roads had been built through the<p>

[<b>Page 438</b>]<p>

hill passes fro. the lowlands. Indian farmers had been encouraged to lease plots of land and
villages in the uplands, and government revenues had risen considerably. Forest revenues,
for instance, had risen fro. Rs. 2,106in 1865-66 to Rs. 9,634 in 1866-67 and up to Rs.
18,411 in 1868-69. Excise revenue (taxation on liquor and drugs) had risen from Rs. 4000
to over Rs. 13,000 in three years.<a name="rf438.1"></a><a

and the increased revenue but he was disappointed by the small number of immigrant
farmers and the lack of success among forest cultivators. Only fifty-nine cultivator colonists
had "been induced to leave the plains and take up lands in area about 60,000 acres."<a

bringing the wild Gonds and Bygahs down from the hills." He defended, however, the lack
of success among the forest cultivators in the last two years, saying, "these people," had
"followed for ages their present wild pursuits," and could not "be entirely weaned therefrom
and introduced into an entirely different sphere of life," in a short time.<a

The activities of the British administrators in the Balaghat-Mandla area during the 1860s
indicates they concentrated more on the promotion of programs such as colonization and
increasing forest revenues than on tribal welfare. When faced with decisions, British
administrators almost always chose and justified their own special programs which meant
they ignored, disregarded or failed to promote tribal<p>

[<b>Page 439</b>]<p>

interests. The main feature of British administration in this area during the 1860s was the
seizure of tribal land for government property, especially to promote colonization by
non-tribal settlers. By 1870, this colonization program showed small progress among Indian
settlers. Among Europeans, it was a failure. Only one European, a Frenchman, M. Michia,
had bought land in Mandla district, but he did not fulfill his promise to colonize the land. A
British administrator, J. Forsyth, characterized him as "speculating on the value of the forest
produce," and"land-jobbing."<a name="rf439.1"></a><a

While British laws, procedures, and programs of the 1860s deprived forest tribes of their
legal rights to occupy and cultivate in the new government land, British administrators
remained divided in their attitudes and goals about forest tribes. They admired some aspects
of Baiga culture and disapproved others. They sought to change the Baigas, but were unable
to discover and decide on which methods to use.<p>

The British admired the Baigas for their independence, courage, and skill to live in a hostile
forest environment.In the early 1860s , forest officer Pearson thought the "Bhoomeahs or

While British administrators admired the Baiga for several reasons, they were unanimous in

forests "already cover with good timber and that which may with conservation be recovered

administrators already had the answer in the 1860s, but they did not make the connection:
the rotation of bewar sites over twelve to fifteen year periods permitted forest regeneration.
In. the 1860s, however, the British remained convinced that forest cultivators destroyed the
forests. This justified the occupation of lands by the government for conservation, taxation,
and colonization.<p>

The British disapproved of the Baigas for several other reasons, besides their supposed
destruction of the forests.Baigas were criticized for being lazy, nomadic, poor, isolated, not
contributing to the<p>

market economy or government revenue, and for being less civilized than others. As early
as 1863, Thomson had talked with a local Indian who traded in grain with the Baigas; and he
hoped the trader could "succeed in civilizing them [the Baigas] so far as to make them settle
down, cultivate the soil like other people, and leave off destroying the forests."<a

had convinced the Baiga of the "benefit it is to them," and had "created wants which their

It is clear from British attitudes that they favored a single social and economic framework --
settled farmers, practicing plough cultivation and using intensive methods such as irrigation
to produce food and cash crops for exchange in a market economy, and paying a legitimate
rent or revenue to the government. A local group which the British officials highly praised
and contrasted with the Baiga, was the Powar "agricultural caste." The Powars practiced
intensive rice cultivation in settled villages in the plains south of the uplands and in the
valleys of the uplands. In the 1820s a retired Maratha officer, Lachman Niak, had carried
out a colonization scheme by building a road and attracting Powars to settle some villages in
the valleys.<a name="rf443.2"></a><a

colonization efforts in the late1860s were mainly directed to attract more Powar settlers. In

British mixed attitudes of approval and disapproval toward the Baigas contributed toward
uncertain and varied suggestions on how to<p>

[<b>Page 444</b>]<p>

deal with forest cultivators. Almost all agreed the Baigas should eventually cease forest or
axe cultivation and become settled or plough cultivators, but they could not agree on specific
measures. In the late 1860s, though Baiga claims of land ownership were rejected, they were
allowed the use of the land in some places. The administration declared that "according to all
positive law, according to the [land revenue] Settlement Code, and according to the custom
of the country," Baiga. had "no title to proprietory [landlord] right or to occupancy[tenant]
right in the tract over which they roamed."<aname="rf444.1"></a><a

Mandla, Ward found it "quite impractical as well as hard and impolitic, to force the Baygars
to give up their dhya cultivation and take to the plough." Instead he tried"to confine their
destructive propensities within a ring fence." He found the Baigas of twelve villages
"claimed" an area of 30 thousand acres, though they cultivated only 1,432 acres at the time.

Chief Commissioner Temple recognized the absolute prohibition of bewar might "improve
these poor people off the face of the earth," and stopping dhya might lead "to despair" or to
"distress." It might even mean "armed resistence by Gonds," or "plunder" or
"cattle-stealing." He wanted to keep the forest tribes in the forests to prevent the "wild

Local British administrators found these idealistic goals difficult to implement. Thomson
learned from a "young kind of Chief" of a Baiga village that he did not cultivate "the good
land" because "they had no bullocks," and"their fathers had" cultivated the hillsides "before
them." Thomson tried to arrange for him to get bullocks.<a name="rf445.3"></a><a

offer of four wives if he would teach them plough cultivation. Seventy years later, an

difficult to induce forest cultivators "to follow a different mode of life." Compulsory
measures would only drive them into adjacent areas such as the Feudatory States of
Chhattisgarh, where they could "carry on the old practices without any form of interruption."
Bloomfield advised conciliation, and he especially hoped the Baigas would begin "to look to
the district authorities as their protectors." He told of one example of how he had"protected"
the Baigas when they complained that private contractors had illegally fined them; he had
made the contractors refund the money. Even more important, he permitted the Baigas to
use forest land by paying an annual tax of Rs. 1 per axe. <a name="rf446.4"></a><a

The writer of the <U>Provincial Gazetteer</U> was concerned about the tribals--so far
contact with "civilization" had reduced "the semi-savage aboriginal" to the "condition of a
mere besotted animal." The writer suggested alternative occupations which would shield

 Forsyth also questioned the effects of British laws on tribal people in the 1860a and for the
future. He saw that one of the "flaws" in the sale and leasing of waste lands was that only
"capitalists" could secure "legal property title; and the aboriginal never had such capital as
would enable him to do so." More generally he realized the British legal system was "too
sharp and swift" for the aboriginal. It was "death to the honest, timid, and unsettled
aboriginal."<a name="rf447.2"></a><a

During the 1860s British administrators made several suggestions and attempts to deal with
the forest tribes. Like their attitudes of approval and disapproval, their methods alternated
between conciliation and compulsion. They legally reserved large lands for the government
and informed forest cultivators they must move out of those lands into agricultural villages.
They considered the prohibition of bewar and the end to the axe tax in order to force forest
cultivators to begin plough cultivation and pay rents and taxes. But generally British
administrators found proposals for these compulsory measures hard to enforce. In<p>

[<b>Page 448</b>]<p>

trying conciliatory measures, they permitted a continuance of some axe cultivation in
specially designated areas and tried to "wean" forest tribes from the axe through discussions,
suggestions, and protection. Most Baigas were too poor to buy or rent land, cattle, and farm
implements. They lacked the training and skills for plough cultivation; nor were they
convinced of its comparative benefits.<p>

<a href="#top"><img src="top.gif" alt="Back to the top" border=0 align=middle></a><p>

British activities to settle Baigas and prevent bewar cultivation in the 1870s and 1880s
occurred in four stages. In the first stage, during the early 1870s, Bloomfield continued to
encourage Baigas to adopt plough cultivation. In the second stage, in the late 1870s, the
British decided finally to prohibit bewar; the new District Commissioner Repton attempted
to enforce the prohibition while offering financial assistance to willing Baiga settlers. In the
early 1880s, when Bloom-field returned to the district as Deputy Commissioner, he
expanded aid programs. In the last stage, British administrators decided to reduce aid and
limit it to a few villages. By 1888 the British diverted their attention to other administrative
problems, considering the aid program a success.<p>

During Bloomfield's first administration (1868-1872), he was able to encourage and assist
Baigas of three villages to begin plough cultivation under their leaders. Before 1868 some
Binjhwar Baigas of north-western Balaghat district, in the Mau valley, had already begun
plough cultivation. Among the Narotrias of the central highlands, the Baigas of Gohara
village also began plough cultivation under Garur's leadership.<p>

[<b>Page 449</b>]<p>

Bloomfield convinced a second Narotria chief, Matna Pujari of Jaldidhar, to try plough
cultivation, but Matna Pujari warned Bloomfield he would also continue some bewar, even
if Bloomfield "cut his throat for it."<a name="rf449.1"></a><a

of a rogue elephant led to the settlement of a third Narotria village. The elephant, having
escaped from Ellichpur in 1851, eventually wandered into the Balaghat highlands. In 1871
the "man eating" elephant ran amok,killing 41 persons, before he was captured and killed.
Bloomfield and Mr. Naylor were helped by the Baigas of Khandapur who used their
"charms and incantations" to blind the elephant.<a name="rf449.2"></a><a

Bloomfield's departure in 1872 marked the end of this first stage.<p>

The second stage began in 1875 with the prohibition of bewar in Government forests and
culminated with Major H. M. Repton's rule of the district in 1878. After bewar prohibition
there was a very extensive emigration of Baigas from Government to Zamindari forests
where they continued bewar.<a name="rf449.4"></a><a

destruction of crops," and recommended somewhat less stringent measures of axe
confiscation, arrests, and penalties for bewar. This "vigorous system of prevention" should
be "accompanied by offers of land and grants of bullocks and seed." Rs. 1000 was
sanctioned for this.<a name="rf450.3"></a><a

returned as District Commissioner of Balaghat from August 1880 to February 1885.
Bloomfield attempted to encourage any and<p>

all Baigas who wanted to try cultivation, and to introduce closer contact between Baigas
and Europeans. In June1881, he obtained the sanction of a Rs. 10,000 grant for Baiga
assistance. From a small beginning in 1878 of Rs.400 to assist 19 Baiga families, the aid
program reached a peak in 1882 when about 190 Baiga families were assisted with Rs.
2,280 spent on bullocks, grain and implements.<a name="rf451.1"></a><a

In a plea to the administration, Bloomfield fully stated the case for assistance even more
strongly. The need to end the "very great" damage Baigas did to the forests was only one
reason they were "worthy and deserving" of assistance. While some officers might<p>

the way of burning crops, summary evictions, and so forth, . . they entirely forget, if indeed
are not ignorant, of the rights the Baigas might claim. For generations untold . . . the
ancestors of these Baigas have lived, died and been buried on the slopes of these hills and in
the fastness of these jungles. They have supported themselves, their families and their aged
parents without the aid or interference of the State, or poor laws, or anything else . . . .<br>

families in eight villages.Over the next three years he spent about Rs. 2,000 annually, so

Baigas protested against the prohibition of bewar in other ways than fleeing the area. When
John W. Neill, Commissioner of Nagpur Division, visited Baihar in March 1881 he met
almost all the adult male Baigas at Karwahi, Baihar and other places. They asked that the
prohibition "be withdrawn and prayed and besought me not to deprive them of their only
means of livelihood," or to permit it one more year, pleading "their inability to take to regular
cultivation." Neill recognized that forbidding all bewar and not assisting Baigas would result
in one of two unfortunate alternatives--either the Baigas would "cut <U>bewar</U> at all
risks," or "emigrate <U>en mass </U>to enjoy in Kawardha and elsewhere the liberty they
no longer possess with us."<a name="rf456.4"></a><A

European attention, donations, and perhaps a missionary. He feared the Baigas would revert
to bewar cultivation or sink to "the level of the lowest classes" in agricultural villages unless

Proposals for reorganizing the aid program to Baigas in 1884 initiated the fourth stage. The
proposals came from F. Venning, Commissioner of Nagpur Division. His ideas implied a
criticism of Bloomfield's efforts, seen as too"unsystematic."<p>

Venning wanted to concentrate government assistance in two ways--(1) "to grant
<U>substantial</U> aid to deserving cases," instead of small sums to a large number of
Baigas, and (2) to reduce the number of assisted villages so that Baigas could be "properly

District Commissioner Bryce Thomas implemented this revised program.<p>

[<b>Page 459</b>]<p>

Whereas 30 villages had been assisted before 1885, Thomas offered assistance to Baigas in
only six of the largest Baiga villages. The amount of aid and the number of families assisted
also declined. While as many as 190families had received Rs. 2,280 assistance in 1882,
Thomas concentrated the program among 69 Narotria families using Rs. 397. Most of these
received only grain and tools, while 11 families received "substantial" aid of bullocks, grain
and tools. One of them was Natti of Sarekha village. The administration supplied his family
with two bullocks, one khandi food grain and one and a half khandis seed grain, one pickaxe
(dholi), and one plough, a total value of Rs. 31.<a name="rf459.1"></a><a

By the mid 1880s, British administrators had begun to question the effectiveness of the aid
program. Even Bloomfield, while thinking the settled Baigas were "more happy and
contented" than before, admitted they were"like all wild branches of the human race . . .
only too ready and willing to be spoilt by being allowed to sit at home at ease and do
nothing."<a name="rf459.2"></a><a

characterized the Baigas as "excessively lazy and opposed to any work"; they built
"wretched field bunds"(embankments). He suspected the Baigas of digging up and eating the
Government seed grain, and "that more than one Government bullock, reportedly destroyed
by tigers," had "furnished a meal for these people."<a name="rf460.1"></a><a

these suspicions were true or not, later British writers accepted and repeated them, and
Thomas decided Baigas had to be more closely supervised. He chose and designated a local
resident in the six villages as "Madatgar" or assistant. Each received some "land rent-free,' as
payment to teach the Baigas how to "prepare their fields" and sow the seed, and take "care
of the produce of all Baigas after the harvest"; then the grain was measured and "accounts . .
. made up." Two or three of the six madatgars were non-Baigas. Only by the arrangement of
madatgars, Thomas felt, could the administration hope "to gradually reclaim these people
from their wild life and forest-destroying proclivities."<a name="rf460.2"></a><a
HREF="#N_460.2_"><SUP>(460.2)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="460.2. Ibid., pp. 5-7."><p>

The last year Baigas were assisted appears to be 1887. The administration granted Rs. 732
to 94 families in 10villages. 81 families were assisted in the five villages which had been
assisted the previous year and 34 families were assisted in five new villages. Over the past six
years, Rs. 9,500 had been spent on the Baigas.<a name="rf460.3"></a><a

Already in late 1886 Venning felt "the main object" of the aid program "in training the
Baiga to settle" had "been attained." He thought<p>

[<b>Page 461</b>]<p>

"<U>bewar</U> had really been put an end to in the Government forests," though some
of the Zamindars still allowed "it in their own forests." Thus he found it "unnecessary to

Over a twenty year period from 1868 to 1888 British administrators had used "compulsory
and conciliatory"methods to end bewar and settle Baigas. While at first conciliation brought
Baigas of only three villages to settle down, the compulsory methods later brought as little
success, resulting in difficulties and an exodus of the Baigas.The intensified assistance
program of the early 1880s provided some Baigas with the necessary land, bullocks, grain
and tools to begin plough cultivation.In the mid-1880s administrators reduced and limited
assistance and became convinced the program had generally succeeded.<p>

 As administrators considered the Beige program a success, they once again turned their
attention away from tribal improvement to reorganizing the management of forests and
promoting agricultural settlement of the upland valleys. In the late 1880s the provincial
administration reassessed forest and colonization policies. In each district Government
forests were divided between "A" and "B" lands. In the next decade, forest officers made
detailed examinations of forest lands and formed "working plans" for "A" forests to ensure
conservation through rotated cuttings.More lands were classified as "B" or less valuable
forest; "survey plots" of about ten acres each were clearly mapped and<p>

[<b>Page 462</b>]<p>

made available for agricultural settlers. The administration decided on two changes--(1) in
order to provide forest workers with lands, "Forest Villages" were established within the "A"
forests; (2) agricultural settlers on government and "B" forest lands would be taxed through
the ryotwari system.<a name="rf462.1"></a><a
HREF="#N_462.1_"><SUP>(462.1)</SUP></A><img src="blue.gif" alt="462.1. See 
CCCP, Resolution, 8 November 1888, on Forest Cultivation and Excise of Culturable 
Land, in CPRAP, November 1888, #20, pp.
65-70. The ryotwari system contrasted to the malguzari or landlord system of 
tenants paying rent to the landlord and the landlord paying revenue to the 
Government. Under the
ryotwarisystem cultivators (or ryots) paid rent to the  Government 
collected by a local agent, the patel."><p>

In the Forest Villages, families were permitted to live and cultivate some nearby land as
long as one adult male of each family worked for the forest department. In Balaghat and
Mandla districts, most of these families were Gonds and Baigas. Later investigations
indicated life was not easy in the forest villages, unless families had an additional adult male
who could supplement the family income of wages from forest work through garden
cultivation or other activities. Nonetheless, the existence of forest villages generally supplied
the forest department with local labor while they allowed tribals to remain within a forest
environment.<p>

By classifying some of the forest lands as "B" areas, more lands were made available for
cultivators. One of the main reasons for the creation of Balaghat district in 1867 had been to
encourage colonization. A report of the1890s reviewed this goal over the years.<p>

<blockquote>After the first wild hope of European colonization and tea and coffee plantations had died
away, it remained only to carry through the more modest ambition of making the tract a well
cultivated one according to native standards.</blockquote><p>

[<b>Page 463</b>]<p>

As the local Gond was "a migratory, thriftless fellow," it was necessary to attract
"cultivators of industrious castes. . . from the plains." Bloomfield made "some progress . . .
towards settling the large expanses of fertile land with sturdy Powar peasantry."<a

term.Other batches of villages were leased in 1876, 1877 and 1884 for a total of about 300

visited the leased villages in1886, he reported few
settlers had fulfilled the terms of the leases. Consistent with the general shift of
administrative policy from landlord to cultivator ownership of the land, all villages except
eleven became ryotwari villages. Five men were awarded landlord rights and six awarded the
post of hereditary headmen (patel). After the late 1880s the administration managed and
taxed the majority of the leased villages and my new villages under this ryotwari land
tenure.<p>

While administrative activity among the Baigas languished after the<p>

[<b>Page 464</b>]<p>

1880s in Balaghat district, a new program was initiated in Mandla in the early 1890s. Like
Balaghat, forest administration was being reorganized in Mandla and the administration
began to consider how to effectively prevent bewar in that district. At the same time, the
administration considered Baigas and others as valuable forest workers and wished to
establish some areas especially for the Baigas to live .<p>

In the 1860s Ward had permitted Baigas of twelve villages in eastern Mandla district to
continue bewar. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, the administration offered assistance to
Baigas to settle down, simultaneous to the program in Balaghat district. In Mandla between
June 1879 and 1884 a total of Ra. 2806 was spent on 127families to settle in six villages.
The money bought cattle, seed-grain, and farm implements, plus a small amount used in
1879 to settle petty debts. One of the villages was Silpur (later probably called Silpura). Lap
Singh, the leader of Baigas from Kisli and Lalijharia villages, had been convinced in an

Mandla district consisted of two distinctly different tahsils--in the west (Mandla tahsil)
around Mandla town, much of the valley was well<p>

[<b>Page 465</b>]<p>

cultivated though surrounded by forests. In the east, in Ramgarh (later Dindori) tahsil, the
geography was the opposite--mostly forested hills surrounding small cultivated valleys.
Correspondingly, malguzari villages predominated in Mandla tahsil, while government
villages (ryotwari) and forest villages predominated in Dindori tahsil. While the assistance
programs of the early 1880s dealt mainly with Baigas of Mandla tahsil, the program of the
1890s concentrated on bewar prevention in Ramgarh tahsil.<p>

It was here that the administration wanted to re-establish an area for Baigas, like Ward's
"ring-fence" of the1860s. M. Mattanah (Divisional Forest Officer of Mandla) indicated the
value of Baigas to the forest department.<p>

<blockquote>We are entirely dependent for our labour supply on these Baigas who are by far the best
wood-cutters of the district. Indeed it appears to me we can scarcely get on with our work,
should we loose this valuable source of labor supply. Collection of harra and minor
products, and line cuttings, would be impossible without them. <a name="rf465.1"></a><a

In May 1890 the administration selected an area of 23,920 acres in southeast Ramgarh
tahsil, to be called the"Baiga reserve," or the Baiga Chak, for all bewar-cutting Baiga. Baigas
were to move into the Chak as bewar would be strictly prohibited outside the area. Only
Baiga "must be allowed to settle in the Reserve."<a name="rf465.2"></a><a

the British dealt with four types of lands--the Chak orreservation, Forest 
Department land, ryotwari or Government land mainly in Dindori tahsil, and malguzari
landmainly in Mandla tahsil. Baigas at times migrated to a fifth type of 
land--Zamindari estates where British administrators had less direct authority.">Forest
officers would show Baigas<p>

[<b>Page 466</b>]<p>

the areas where bewar was permitted, in order to prevent bewar and denudation of the
forest on the ridges. The administration made it clear, however, that even in the Chak they
disapproved "this form of cultivation," and would tax each axe Rs. 1 per year. Baigas were
offered two alternatives to bewar --(1) to settle down as plough cultivators, and (2) to work
for the forest department. The incentives for plough cultivation included no rent on leased
plots for the first three years and one-quarter rupee for the next seven years; in addition the
administration would advance interest-free loans "for the purchase of plough cattle and
seed-grain." The Forest Department would find work "for all who may agree to work in the
forest under the orders of Forest Officers." These Baiga would be helped to build houses
and provided with "plots for home cultivation" in Forest Villages. They would be
"preferentially employed" by the Department; all private contracts for collecting forest
produce "must stipulate this preferential employment." The Baigas who refused to migrate
into the Chak, were offered the same two alternatives on the same conditions--to become
plough cultivators on Government plots, or be hired as workmen for the forest Department.
For Baigas living in or near malguzari villages, the administration encouraged the landlords
to settle Baigas. If a landlord brought Baigas to cultivate land for five years, the fields would
be taxed at only one-half the normal rate; landlords "who really interest themselves" to settle
Baigas, would be given an honorary headdress (<U>purgri</U>) in a public ceremony (the
District Durbar).<a name="rf466.1"></a><a

The administration discouraged Baigas who lived in Mandla tahsil from migrating to the
Reserve, though The administration said there was "room enough in the Reserve for the
Baigas" of both tahsils. Rather efforts "shall be made to induce" the Mandla tahsil Baigas "to
settle down" under the previous described "attraction of terms" on government or malguzari
land. In order to stop any further bewar cultivation in malguzari villages, The administration
would enforce the term of the village administration papers (<U>wajib-ul-arz</U>) which
prohibited the cutting of valuable trees.<a name="rf467.1"></a><a

The administration's orders of May 1890 establishing the Baiga Chak contained a mixture
of confusing, or even contradictory, ideas. Rather than the original purpose of the Chak--to
provide an area for all bewar-cutting Baiga--in essence the administration wished to convert
or reform their residents into plough cultivators. The administration also preferred, in the
end, for Mandla tahsil Baigas to remain in their villages, not to move, but settle to plough
cultivation.<p>

The next few years became some of the most difficult for Mandla District Baigas; many of
the provisions of the May 1890 orders were not consistently enforced or fulfilled. Within the
Chak, forest offices selected areas for bewar which the Baigas found unsatisfactory or
insufficient. The administration was also slow to offer the promised financial assistance both
within and outside the Chak. In 1895 the administration decided Baigas were not settling
rapidly enough and thus allowed Gonds and other plough cultivators to migrate into the
Chak to help<p>

Forest Department wanted the Baigas of Rajni Sarai village in the Chak to move to the
Banjar Forest Reserve to cut timber for railway sleepers (ties).Instead the entire population
of about 100 escaped to Kawardha. Gonds repopulated the village. In ten years (1891 to
1901) the population of the Chak fell from 1,551 Baigas of 362 families to 700 Baigas of
132 families. The exodus of the Ragni Sarai Baigas further reduced the Baiga population to

administration's policy.<p>

The pleas of the Baigas in the 1890s and the administration's investigation of forests began
to stimulate a re-assessment of administration policy toward Baigas in the twentieth century.
Fuller had already felt Baigas might be allowed to bewar in remote forests. C. M. McCrie,
the Divisional Forest Officer of Mandla, examined the effects of bewar in the Ghurgi estate.
He found "the figures clearly show that bewar-cutting does not entail the permanent
extinction of forest growth on the areas on which it is practiced."Bewars did "little harm or
permanent damage" when old bewars were allowed "sufficient rest" and when the forest was
protected from fires spreading beyond the bewars. Bewars<p>

[<b>Page 472</b>]<p>

"did not have any real effect of denudation or ruining the water-supply."<a

century (about1901) J. B. Fuller again restated
his doubts about "the past rather exaggerated ideas . . . of the injurious effects of bewar."
Bewar might change the types of trees which grew in bewar areas, but he thought it "much
more important that a tribe of people should live in peace and comfort."<a

forest officer, who had worked several years in both
Balaghat and Mandla districts, re-affirmed McCrie's and Fuller's ideas in 1909. He thought
"the importance of the whole matter [of bewar destroying forests] had been exaggerated,"
and there was"a general want of perspective," when "urgent questions such as the fire
protection and the working of several hundred square miles of pure sal forests" were
"ignored or passed by without comment" while so much was"talked and written about the

emphasized that Baigas only practiced bewar above the frost zone permitting "the
extraordinary regrowth that springs up within a few years." Gonds and others might damage
the forest below the frost line causing "the ruined aspect of many low-lying frost-bitten
areas." Percival asked, if bewar caused permanent damage, how could one explain the often
wonderful regrowth of sal" that stretched "in an almost unbroken line of forest from the
Baiga Chak to Karadih towards Amarkantak, say twenty square miles," or the sal forests of
Balaghat where "the majority are old bewar areas?" He thought that if the forests<p>

[<b>Page 473</b>]<p>

were near railways and had obvious commercial value, "no one would say anything about
damage or denudation"and the forest department would "not professionally hesitate for a
moment in constituting felling series."<a name="rf473.1"></a><a

McCrie, Fuller, Percival and other officers expressed opinions on forest conservation
which coincided with the Baiga ideas and practices for controlled bewar cultivation and
forest conservation. Unfortunately these ideas began to predominate administration policy
only in the last twenty years of the period between 1861 and 1921.During the first forty
years British administrators had remained convinced bewar cutting mined forests and they
used a variety of methods to prohibit bewar and "wean" the Baiga from forest cultivation to
plough cultivation.<p>

In 1916 the administration finally passed a law permitting con-trolled bewar in selected
villages. The village administration paper for Ganjaisarra (in south-central Baihar tahsil) for
example, stipulated<p>

<blockquote>In this village, in accordance with Secretariate latter . . . 16th October 1916, and with the
Deputy Commissioner's. . . <U>bewar</U> or <U>siddam</U> is permitted in the entire

In the 1860s Baigas learned that the new rulers wanted them to follow another way of
living and working.Previously most Baigas lived and worked in the upland forests of
Central India by bewar cultivation, hunting, and gathering forest food and produce. They
used axes, bows, spears, and digging tools. The new White Sahebs of the 1860s and later
told the Baigas they must move to the valleys and learn plough cultivation like their Gond
brothers. The White Sahebs brought new laws by which they took possession of the land.
The laws allowed the rulers to sell or lease the cultivatable land to anyone such as other
white men and Powars. Even Gonds and Baigas could lease or buy back the land. The rulers
took the forest lands to manage and tax as they chose.Between 1861 and 1921 the Baigas
struggled to live and work under the new rules of the British. A few adapted plough
cultivation; most found other ways to live and work.<p>

Balaghat district provides a specific example of British activity in the highlands of central
India. The British had created Balaghat district in the 1860s with three main goals in
mind--(1) to manage the forests, (2) to attract colonists, and (3) to convert forest cultivators
into plough cultivators. They were more successful with the first two goals than the third.
The government's management and sale of forest produce brought increased forest revenue.
From Rs. 2000 in 1866 it rose<p>

[Page 475</b>]<p>

to Rs. 18,000 in 1869; by the early 1890S it had jumped to between Rs 70,000 and
80,000. With railway construction in the western valley during the first year of the twentieth
century, the forest revenue exceeded Rs.200,000; it then declined in the remaining years
before 1921 to around Rs. 100,000.<a name="rf475.1"></a><a

times as much land (160,877 acres). Their rent had quadrupled (from 15,000 to 63,000).<a

British acquisition and development of land in Baihar had brought considerable revenue;
they had transformed the "howling wildreness" of the 1860s, but not reformed the
Baiga.<p>

The Baigas used three methods to resist British pressure and<p>

[<b>Page 476</b>]<p>

survive--(l) nominal cooperation or superficial reform, (2) occupational adjustments, and
(3) protest by petition or migration. At the same time, though the main thrust of British
policy was (as J. B. Fuller said) for Baigas to"reform or perish," British administrators
expressed mixed attitudes toward the Baiga of sympathy and disapproval which also resulted
in a variety of methods including conciliation and compulsion.<p>

Bloomfield told about the Baigas' nominal cooperation when he explained the difficulties of
settling Baigas in1869. It was hard to make them understand "that orders must be obeyed";
they promised "not to cut any . . .prohibited kinds of timber," but then "cut all kinds of trees
. . . in spite of all promises repeatedly made." A"common saying among . . . the officials"
was that every official who becomes "much annoyed" by the "mischief done in the forests by
the Bygahs, and declares they must be expelled," when he goes to "interview" them, "he
relents and does all he can to protect them."<a name="rf476.1"></a><a

The Baiga Chak represents an example of superficial reform or conversion of Baigas to
plough cultivation. While the <U>Mandla District Gazetteer</U> of 1912 said it was "highly
satisfactory" that "the plough has supplemented the axe in most of the fields owned by
Baigas," it remarked<p>

<blockquote>in actual fact, however, the Baiga has not been reclaimed; he has learnt enough wisdom to
know that Government prefers a ploughed field to a bewar, and has sub-let his land to men
who will plough it for him--a method which is gratifying to both the authorities and to
himself, but is no indication of his own agricultural regeneration.<a name="rf476.2"></a><a

By the 20th century only a few Baigas in the valley villages had taken<p>

[<b>Page 477</b>]<p>

to plough cultivation; most could not or did not because of poverty, lack of training, or
personal belief against the use of the plough. Others earned a living by relying on particular
skills and knowledge. Most of the Baiga who made these occupational adjustments, if
prevented from practicing bewar cultivation, lived in villages adjacent to forests, or in the
"Forest Villages," which the administration had established after the late 1880s. They
worked mainly as woodmen, forest guards or hunting guides (shikaris). Some sold forest and
bamboo produce. A few also worked as field laborers, the men uprooting the plants and the

had to combine some of these activities or supplement their earnings through collecting
forest food or growing crops on hidden and remote bewars. One officer reported he
discovered "some unauthorized bewar" in the Forest Village of Dhiri in northeast Baihar

A third way Baigas earned a living was by continuing to practice bewar cultivation. Though
bewar was legally prohibited, Baigas found They could practice it in Zamindari areas or on
remote hills where British administrators rarely went. The <U>Balaghat District
Gazetteer</U> described eastern Baihar as "a wild tangle of hill and jungle," where Baigas
and Gonds practiced "the only method of cultivation possible<p>

Ever since the arrival of the British in the 1860s, Baigas protested against the
administration's efforts to end bewar and "wean" them from the axe. These protests took the
form of verbal or written petitions as well as migrations to escape British domination. Both
types of protests have already been described, in the 1860s by Ward and Bloomfield, and
later by Neill, Fuller and others.<p>

While these protests did not change the anti-bewar attitudes among most British
administrators, they stimulateda sympathetic awareness among some of them of Baiga
complaints and conditions, and attained some small concessions. Ward allowed villages to
continue bewar. The financial assistance program of the 1880s and the establishment of
Forest Villages were perhaps influenced by Baiga protests. Certainly their protests had some
influence on the British re-assessment of bewar prohibition policies in the twentieth century.
A legal change in1916, allowing controlled bewar in a few villages, evidently was not
enough for the Baigas, and, like other orders, was not enforced or publicized. One Zamindar
continued to collect a high axe tax of Rs. 9; his justification was that he was trying to stop
illegal bewar.<a name="rf478.2></a><a

Grigson, Balaghat, p. 31, the Saletekri Zamindari. As late as the early 1940s 
one officer, Mr. Gupta, suggested bewar should be permitted in the Saletekri 
Zamindari, evidently unaware of the 1916 orders. Ibid., p.32.">In the
1930s Ketu Baiga complained of the continued bewar prohibition by the British government.
He commented on the current Indian political demand for <U>swaraj</U> or independence

Baigas adopted three methods to survive under British pressures to "reform or perish."
Though only some Baigas"reformed," and though at times others faced near starvation, the
Baiga and their culture did not "perish." Their growth in numbers at a minimum suggests
survival and there is some indication of cultural survival and continuity. The Baiga
population (in the three districts of Balaghat, Mandla and Bilaspur) grew from about fifteen
thousand in the 1860s to eighteen thousand in the 1890s, twenty-eight thousand in the
1930s, and forty-three thousand in the 1960s.<a name="rf479.2"></a><a

G. N. Tiwari (1976) surveys a predominately Baiga village, Amwar, in southeastern Mandla
district. As with other studies about the Baiga such as Verrier Elwin (1930), W. V.
Grigson(1940s), Stephen Fuchs (1950s), and D. N. Nag (1960s), Tiwari examines the
survival strategies of the Baigas and their cultural activities. Even at this late date, half the
Baigas of the village practiced bewar, though it was illegal and mostly undetected by the
local officials. He also records several of their witty songs which accompany the Karma and
other dances.<a name="rf479.3"></a><a

arrival of the British in the highlands of central India in the 1860s. The relationship of the
Baigas with the British between 1861 and 1921 was essentially a struggle of the people of
each culture to maintain or impose their culture on the other. The Baiga adopted methods to
survive British domination, mainly by adjustments in their occupations and locations. British
policy generally sought to convert the Baiga, in the early years, but because of inconsistent
implementation and Baiga resistance they achieved little success. In the end, they, too, had to
adopt methods, such as Forest Villages, in an effort to accommodate to the completely
different culture of the Baiga.<p>
