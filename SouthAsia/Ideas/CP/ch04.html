<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning 
of the creation of the Central Provinces in 1861 it was the goal of the
British administration to construct a governmental system providing for the improvement and
development of the area. The Government of India Resolution establishing the Central Provinces
noted that the previous forms of administration -- of the Saugor and Narbadda Territories under
the control of the North-Western Provinces, and a separate Province of Nagpur -- did "not
present that unity, completeness and efficiency which are requisite in order that justice may be
done to the condition and prospects of Territories so largely capable of improvement." Therefore
the Government intended to create a new provincial administration encompassing those two areas
Which would provide the new province "with the greatest advantage t the management of the
resources and to the development of the capabilities of 
the whole area."<a name="RN01"></a><A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Part II examines the
activities of the British provincial government to develop the Central Provinces during the six
decades from 1861 to 1921. Though the Government resolution creating the Central Provinces
en-

<P>++Page 105 

<P>visioned the use of government institutions to promote development, wry few departments dealt
with the improvement of the province. Rather they concentrated primarily on law, order, and
taxation; only secondarily on providing rudimentary social services; and least of all on economic
development. With the imposition of a provincial government most of the procedures of British
rule which were designed to consolidate their position in India were brought to the Central
Provinces. The wholesale importation of these procedures meant that there was little imaginative
attempt to revise the form of provincial administration into what was needed to fit the particular
character of middle India, or to meet the specific needs of its economic development.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raghaven Iyer suggests 
that there were four dominant imperialistic themes or theories of
Government that inspired the British administration and justified their ideas and policies-
trusteeship, guardianship, utilitarianism, and evangelism.
<a name="RN02"></a><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  All were animated by a mixture of
paternalism and laissez-faire. On the one hand, British administrators sought to teach and lead
Indians in ways to improve their condition in British terms; on the other hand they sought to
provide institutions which would free Indians to develop in their own chosen ways.
Administrators formed policy based on this mixture of enlightened 
Western despotism and non-interference. Prevailing attitudes of 
Victorian idealism and optimism often clouded over inherent
contradictions of British policy.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One task of 
the new government was to form policies based on cu rent governmental
theories. The effective implementation of these 
policies a was quite a separate and more difficult
activity. The hierarchical

<P>++Page 106

<P>structure of provincial government imported and superimposed on the Central Provinces tended
to divide the policy-making from the implementation functions of administration at the district
level. British administrators above the district level debated, decided and finalized provincial
policy. British administrators at the district level and below attempted to implement these policies
through Indian officials. The division of governmental functions at the district level involving
higher and lower levels of administrators tended to create two separate worlds. Those British
administrators at the higher levels usually based their policies on English theories with only
occasional and superficial reference to empirical information about Indian society and with only
rare consideration of Indian opinion. Under the supervision of lower-level British administrators,
the Indian officials sought to 
implement that policy in the context of local Indian society.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tendencies of the 
British to segregate policy from implementation and to disassociate
British administrators from Indian officials, isolated the higher levels of administration and local
society. British provincial administration lacked the ability to penetrate into the lives of a majority
of the population in the Central Province and therefore had a minimal affect on them. The Indians
whom the British administrators influenced most were those connected with the provincial
administration either as part of administration or involved in its institutions. They mainly consisted
of lower officials, educators and student., the urban population, and taxpayers, in particular those
designated as landlords to pay the land revenue.

<P>interaction with Indian society during six decades from 1861 to 1921. The analytical framework
makes three distinctions. The first is between policy and implementation, that is between goals,
ideas, and the intentions of British administrators, and the achievements and results of British rule.
The second is between two levels, an upper provincial level and a lower district level of
administration and the majority of Indians only partially affected by British administration but
mainly affected by other events and changes. The third is between the two types of departments.
Social service departments include education, health, and local government such as municipal
committees and district councils. Consolidative departments consist of judicial, police, and
taxation. Thus Part II examines two types of administration activity and its interaction with
changes occurring within Indian society. The changes in Indian society consists first of
educational changes, p.litical. evolution, and population growth; and second, land policy and
taxation, and agrarian relations. Judicial and police activities are not examined separately.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first Chief 
Commissioner of the Central Provinces from 1861 to 1866, Richard
Temple formulated the structure of the provincial administration. His first annual report on the
administration of the province contains a wealth of 
information and impressions.<a name="RN03"></a><A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He expressed
both a concern for the everyday establishment and management of the administration and a vision
for the future development of the area. The judicial, police, and taxation systems needed to be
organized; substantial begin-

<P>++Page 109

<P>nings had to made in education, health services, local government; and plans had to made for
other improvements. Temple estimated that the total provincial revenue from all sources was just
over Rs. 8 million. Of this, about Rs. 3.25 million, or a little less than 40 percent consisted of
expenses for the civilian government. Rs. 1.1 million, or 13 percent was paid as pensions and
subsidies to recently deposed Indian rulers of the Central Provinces. Rs. 2.9 million or over 33
percent want for the military. The remainder, somewhat more than Rs. I million or about 12
percent, was for "material improvements," mainly public works. The accompanying table lists the
expenditures of the civilian administration under Temple.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition 
to detailing his reorganization of the administration, Temple stressed the
importance of other measures for the improvement of the province. He suggested that the
payment of land tax (about 64 percent of all taxes) by landlords of the cultivated parts of the
province should be made permanent and unalterable. He was confident that if the central Indian
government would except this principal of land taxation, it would stimulate the "industry,
enterprise, and self-reliance of the agriculturalist, the application of capital, and the accumulation
of wealth."<a name="RN04"></a><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  
He also investigated the possibility of attracting European colonists to settle
unoccupied lands of the province, confident that with "European capital and enterprise, it may be
possible for the "a and plough to invade the ancient domain 
of the Forest and Prairie."<a name="RN05"></a><A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Such
European

<P>++Page 110

<P>colonization in the Central Provinces, he regarded, as the "hope of the future." Temple also made
a preliminary assessment of the forest and mineral wealth of 
the province,<a name="RN06"></a><A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and placed emphasis
on the improvement of communications and transportation. He wanted to put the postal and
electric telegraphic communications on a sound footing (frail and rotting posts constantly
interrupted service in the rainy season) and he had plans to improve the roads. He gave
encouragement to private companies to build an extensive 
railway system across the province.<a name="RN07"></a><A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
His administrative reorganization was to be 
implemented within a couple of years while his plans
for the development of the province would take several years.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the five year 
period (1868-1872) after Temple's administration, the annual income
of the provincial administration averaged over Rs. 8.5 million, while expenditure within the
province rose to over Rs. 4.5 million.<a name="RN08"></a><A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table showing 
provincial expenditures for various departments and activities indicates
that the primary role of government was to promote law and order. The judicial and police
activities including expenditure for salaries and office supplies always exceeded 50 percent of
provincial funds . Social services expenditures for education and health never averaged as much as
17 percent. Expenditures for public works averaged 17 percent during the first three decades but
were increased during the famine-troubled 1890's and 1900's to around 33 percent.

<P>++Page 112

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the general 
division of administrative expenditure changed little, the activities of
government shifted gradually during the six decades of provincial administration under review.
Temple's energetic administration in the 1860's saw the foundation of a provincial bureaucracy
which exhibited many features similar to other Indian provincial administrations . But even by
1868 Henry Morris (Temple's successor) noted a shift. Rather than Temple's activities of
"initiation," Morris emphasized "consolidation and 
development,"<a name="RN09"></a><A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and his long term as Chief
Commissioner until the early 1880's was largely characterized by an effort to continue the
structure of the Temple administration and to sit back and examine its affects on the province. As
a result of this examination, several substantial places of legislation were formulated and passed in
the decade of the 1880's. The last three decades until 1920 were used to amend that legislation
and to revise administrative activity, mainly to deal with the economic problem which the famines
of the 1890's had first revealed.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other broad shifts in 
the character of the administration occurred during those six decades.
Until the middle of the 1880's the Chief Commissionership was held mostly by administrators who
had previously served in some capacity in the province. Between then and 1907 many of these
Chief Commissioners came from other provinces. The period was characterized by rapid
turnovers. Terms were often only two or three years, compared to Morris' thirteen years. Those
who served in the Central Province included Alexander MacKenzie, Anthony MacDonnell, John

<P>++Page 113

<P>Woodburn, Charles Lyall, Denzil Ibbertson, John Hewett, Frederic Lely, and John Miller. During
these years the subordinate staff of the province provided the only continuity. Frequent changes
among these "outsider" Chief Commissioners 
often resulted in divergent views. One Chief Commissioner 
said of his predecessor, he "did not understand the question" of land revenue settlement
and "let himself be betrayed into raising the . . . rent too high;" he was obstinate in making the
amendments.<a name="RN10"></a><A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>
<P>  None of these Chief Commissioners of the middle period had been in charge of
another province in India before; but subsequently, making use of their training in the Central
Provinces, they advanced to the top positions of other provinces.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This importation of "outsiders" led 
to a gradual shift in the character of the administration.
From the 1880's onward, the administration's policies and problems were viewed more in the
broader contest of the British Indian Empire. The relative isolation of the provinces was less
noticeable, and its peculiar administrative procedures and concerns became more standardized and
general. This was especially so in the late decades of the period under review when investigative
commissions frequently toured India, and concerns arose and legislation was formulated in
connection with such matters as irrigation, rural debt, cooperative societies, and land transfers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were than two 
recognizable periods during these six decades of administration.
Roughly the first half was a period of inauguration and consolidation of British provincial
administration, while the second half was a period of revision and standardization in the light both
of

<P>++Page 114

<P>local economic events and all-India influence.

<a name="education"></a>
<p><center><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Education</SPAN></center>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of 
the Central Provinces administration in 1861 social services
received far less priority than other departments such as law and order. Policies and program for
education, health and local government where highly colored by and based mostly on English
ideas and institutions. The purposes and structure of education as introduced closely followed
British school models. So also with respect to health programs ; British administrators promoted
ideas and practices of contemporary Waste= medicine, while Hindu, 
Muslim, and other local practices and their doctors were disregarded. 
Local government suffered a similar treatment. The
British made a little attempt to collect information about pre-British local governmental
institutions or lend support to them. Instead, they established Municipal Committees, District
Councils, and eventually a Provincial Council. these essentially British civil institutions were
usually expected to be financially self-supporting and this severely limited their effectiveness.
During the six decades from 1861 to 1921 these social and local government institutions had
checkered history, being alternately promoted and ignored as personnel in the provincial
administration changed. As a result they affected the lives of only a small upper segment of the
provincial population. This section examines the first of these three social service institutions-education.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1880's the 
British made an assessment of education in the Central Provinces and
considered the situation far from satisfactory. One report states that they found the people
"thoroughly uneducated . . . .

<P>++Page 115

<P>In no part of British India can there be found a population lower or darker in this respect." There
were no places of Indian learning, "no educated 
youths anywhere."<a name="RN11"></a><A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In the southern part of the
province, for example, there were few educated Maratha Brahmins to fill government offices, so
Indians were drawn from other provinces and these were considered "foreigners" during these
early years. One of the assessments about education indicates the British were beginning to form
an education policy which distinquished between different social classes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the great 
agricultural community the complete preservation of the upper and
middle classes is, perhaps, a happy circumstance. They are, indeed, rude and uninstructed,
but they exist and maintain their relative position. In all districts there is a middle class, a
degree below the upper class, but clearly above the mass of the rustic people. If this
middle class can be gradually enlightened and civilized, it will serve as a lever to lift up the
mass of the people from the slough of ignorance and 
apathy.<a name="RN12"></a><A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>

<P>These British assessments reflect three implications which had significance for the future of
education in the Central Provinces. First, education al efforts were to be directed mainly toward
the agricultural "middle class," whom the British recorded as 
the village landlords or <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">malguzars</SPAN>. 
Second, it was assumed and educated middle class would raise the lower classes from their
uneducated state. Third, it was intended that at least some of the newly educated Indians,
especially the Maratha Brahins , would fill subordinate administrative posts.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to encourage 
education in the Central Provinces waxed and waned over the six
decades. Already in the early 1860's an education department had been atablished with its
inspectors, a few government

<P>++Page 116

<P>schools and many aided schools. Chief Commissioner Richard Temple supported education
declaring that "Commissioners, the Deputy Commissioners and their Assistants are as much
responsible for the various Government schools, great and small in their charge, as they are for
the Courts, the Jails, the Dispensaries and the District 
roads."<a name="RN13"></a><A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  There was an initial period of
expansion. During the first decade (from 1862-1872) the number of all schools increased from
1210 to 1778, while the students quadrupled from 21,327 
to 82,930.<a name="RN14"></a><A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Many local British officials
made extraordinary efforts to promote education in the late 1860's and early 1870's.  Under the
persuasion of district officers some Indians opened private schools. When, later in the 1870's,
education began to decline, these same Indians refused to maintain their schools "except under
compulsion." In that decade (1870's)educational institutions declined by 213 to 1565, while the
number of students rose very slowly, 
from 82,930 to 89,506.<a name="RN15"></a><A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  
One explanation for this lack of
continual growth was said to be compulsive policy of the government.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1870's a 
student in the Central Provinces wrote an essay for a comparative
scholarship on aspects of these compulsive methods. He complained that British officials severely
"oppressed" and punished parents of truant students. Such parents had to meet the British officer
at his pleasure, receive admonition, and sometimes sign an agreement to

<P>send their children to school. The student wrote that parents would "at last send their children to
school regularly . . . when they suffered all such hardships, viz, that of being detained without
purpose for several days together at the house or in the Court of the District Commissioner, and
of paying the . . . fees of the peons, the value of the stamp paper, 
and the fees of the writer."<a name="RN16"></a><A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The
student suggested that some district officers,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a view to gain name, 
spare no means to collect a' many boys as they can, without the
least consideration of the he- arising therefrom. They rather seem to think that, unless the
ignorant people were punished to a certain extent, they would always object to attend to
education.<a name="RN17"></a><A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>

<P>In a reply required by the  Government of India to these and other charges of "oppression used in
the Central Provinces to fill Zillah schools," the Chief Commissioner did not directly deny any of
the charges, nor wk. a "useless inquiry of the British officers" to ask if they had "been guilty of
putting improper pressure on the people . . . and of misusing 
their authority."<a name="RN18"></a><A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Rather he relied on
his own personal knowledge and stated that in 1869 the Chief Commissioner had explained to
district officers "that though they should use all their endeavours and all their official influence to
get parents to send their children to school, no harsh measures would be tolerated." The Chief
Commissioner suggested that touring District Commissioners probably did admonish parents of
truant children and expressed his opinion that "if Government shows no interest in education and
does not push the people, they cannot be expected of

<P>++Page 119

<P>themselves to appreciate a boon" (education), and he felt that in India " among similar people in
Europe, education was "held but in light estimation by the lower classes" when they were "not
being subjected to compulsory instruction."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Chief Commissioner 
did not openly denounce these compulsive methods,
criticism leveled against it did seem to influence policy. In 1875 the Chief Commissioner ordered
that local British officers should encourage education less through their executive assistants
(tahsildars) and more through the education department's Indian 
inspectors.<a name="RN19"></a><A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  This carried some
negative results for by transferring the matter from executive to departmental officers, it left it to
officers who had less status and authority. It was at this time that the rapid development during
the 1860's slowed down and this decline continued until it reached stagnation in the late 18701s.
Stagnation in education continued during this middle period until about 1905. It was during this
period that there were a number of short-term Chief Commissioners, many of whom had had no
previous knowledge of the province.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow progress of 
education during the last part of the nineteenth century led to
disillusionment among British officials. In Fuller's review of the first three decades of provincial
administration, he admitted that "Public education in its true sense has 
indeed hardly begun."<a name="RN20"></a><A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
Five years earlier the head of the Central Provinces Education Department, in a review of the
discipline and moral training in the

<P>++Page 120

<P>schools and colleges of the Central Provinces, commented 
that as only twelve out of 100 school-going age boys were in the school 
system, "so far as morality is concerned, our schools affect but
little the mass of the population." He also felt that though schools and colleges of the Central
Provinces had been modeled after the English system, the results could not be compared. "British
colleges are a growth, not a creation. Indian colleges and high schools am not a growth but an
alien graft." Sons of gentlemen in England went to college "from fashion, or from the desire of
learning." In India they hoped "merely to obtain employment under government." The 110 college
students in the Central Provinces were not the equivalent of "gentlemen" in the colleges of
England. Only five of the parents had an annual income of over Ea. 5000, while at least a third
had annual incomes of less than 
Rs. 200.<a name="RN21"></a><A HREF="#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  
The Chief Commissioner in 1890 (MacKenzie) did not
seem to encourage education in his annual review. He complained that the Nagpur Municipal
Committee lavished funds on higher education, "while the town wants 
drainage."<a name="RN22"></a><A HREF="#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stagnation in education 
and disillusionment about it continued during the last of the
1800's when famines partially disrupted education efforts. Then by 1905 there were evidences of
change. A "great and spontaneous increase had set in" so that the number of students increased
from 1902 to 1912 "from 153 thousand to 300 
thousand."<a name="RN23"></a><A HREF="#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  This progress was

<P>++Page 121

<P>attributed partly to the "new spirit" of social and political movements, partly as people gained "a
greater appreciation of the benefits of 
education,"<a name="RN24"></a><A HREF="#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> 
partly from an attempt to revise educational
methods, and partly from increased funds. One book which both reflected and encouraged a
revision in the educational system was by Henry 
Sharp, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Rural Schools in 
the Central Provinces</SPAN>.<a name="RN25"></a><A HREF="#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>
<P> 
Sharp wished to make education accessible to rural children. He suggested half-day attendance,
and instruction in useful agricultural knowledge such as the forms and methods of village tax
accountants (patwaris) and money-landers. He also stressed the need to provide traditional Indian
gymnastic exercises (Deshi 
Kasrat).<a name="RN26"></a><A HREF="#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  A 
large increase in funds was reported, as seen in the
accompanying chart for Hoshangabad. There in the 1890's the total annual funds averaged Rs.
40,553 and rose to Rs. 98,734 between 1901-1910. Primary education increased even more
sharply in the same period, from Rs. 23,000 to Rs. 64,500. But while funds more than doubled,
average annual student attendance increased by only 38 percent and schools by 20 percent.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the six decades 
after the establishment of an education department in the Central
Provinces, British methods and institutions Of education became firmly established. Within this
period education grew by fits and starts as British administrators varied widely in their formation
of policy and in their support of its implementation. The first

<P>++Page 122

<P>fifteen years had been ones of extraordinary growth because British executive officers had used
their influence and power to push forward education. Also, during the last fifteen years of the
period, 1905-1920, more Indians sought education and educational funds showed increases -ally.
The near stagnation of the middle years, from the mid 1870's to 1905, my be attributed to British
disillusionment, to rapid changes in administrators who had little knowledge of the province, and
to adverse economic conditions, particularly the wide-spread famines. By 1921 only 10 percent of
the population over ten years old and 5 percent of those over five years of age were literate. Such
an advance from almost zero percent in 1860 appears extraordinary, but in fact it was
discouraging, for more than 90 percent of the population still could not read or write. Only two
out of the eight provinces in British India had lower literacy rates than the Central Provinces and
Berar. Education of the masses or mass education, which in the 1890's had "hardly begun," had by
the 1920's just barely begun.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacillating expansion 
of British-style education in the Central Provinces over six
decades provided a small Indian elite with education, though British administrators had intended,
in the early 1860's, for education to produce far greater direct and Indirect changes among the
population. As noted earlier, education was intended to achieve three objectives: first, to instruct
an "agricultural middle class;" second, these in turn would serve as a "lever" to raise the lower
classes; and third, to train some Indians (especially those classified as Maratha Brahmins) for
subordinate administrative posts. The uneven effect of the slowly rising literacy can be shown by
examining each of these three

<P>++Page 123

<P>"classes." The most immediate need was to train some Indians for

<P>subordinate administrative posts.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention to educate 
Maratha Brahmins as lower officials solved one difficulty but
created others. In order to substitute Maratha Brahmins for the predominance of "north Indian"
Kayasths, mainly in the Marathi speaking Nagpur Division, some Maratha Brahmins had to be
imported from outside that area and they were referred to as "foreigners." The Judicial
Commissioner objected to this replacement of north India "foreigners" with imported Marathi
Brahmins as an unsatisfactory solution. But on a request from the Government of India, the
provincial administration examined the situation in the Nagpur Division closely, and defended its
position by saying that it was politically expedient to have a predominantly Maratha lower
bureaucracy to rule over a Maratha population, and to have Marathi as the court language. They
also pointed out that only 13 percent of the Marathi officials in the Nagpur Division were
imported "Deccani Brahmins," while 59 percent were "natives of Nagpur" and the remaining 24
percent were from "Hindustan." Only in the Education Department did "Deccani Brahmins"
predominate (61 percent) and that was because there were not enough qualified local teachers so
sow had to be imported. The continued presence of so many "Hindustani Kayasths" for sow time
made it difficult to promote the Marathi language as the 
official language of the area. The change-over from Hindi 
or Urdu to Marathi took time and during this period of transition a strange mixed
language emerged which consisted of Urdu grammar and vocabulary,

<P>++Page 124

<P>with some Marathi words, but written in Marathi (Modi) 
script.<a name="RN27"></a><A HREF="#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  By the early 1870's Maratha
officials, both local and "foreigners" predominated, largely to the exclusion of Hindustani
Kayasths, in the Nagpur Division and a purer Marathi had become the official language.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education of local Maratha 
subordinate Indian officials cox. tinned to be a concern at
least into the 1870's. Three times in that decade the Chief Commissioner issued circulars
complaining  that local officials were still hiring foreigners "of the Deccan and North-West
Provinces," instead of educated Central Provinces Indians. The Chief Commissioner
acknowledged that it had no doubt been necessary in the formative years of the administration to
hire foreigners, since "few natives . . . were found fitted for government 
service." But as education had spread and the number 
of locally qualified Indians had increased, the Chief Commissioner
pointed out it was of "great importance" to employ "as much as possible the natives of the
country in its administration." (Central Provinces Proceedings, Home, January 1873, General, #3,
p. 6. The circulars are dated January 10, 1873; March 4, 1874, #7; and March 26, 1877, #7). The
Chief Commissioner observed that the imported "foreign" officials were "naturally anxious to
surround themselves with men of their own race whom they . . . believe more capable," and could
trust, but he hoped his instructions "would be observed in the future." He directly criticized the
Education Department, since it was from that department that most of the "foreigners" had been
transferred to other departments.<a name="RN28"></a><A HREF="#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>

<P>++Page 125

<P>Following the employment of "foreigners" as officials did not remain a major concern of the
Provincial administration, and it appears that the instructions of the Chief Commissioner were
finally implemented local Marathis were educated for various posts so that it was no longer
necessary to import "foreigners" for subordinate posts in  the government

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; British policy originally intended to 
concentrate on educating the agricultural middle-class. Policy differed 
toward them as British administrators did not attempt to train most of them
for government service but rather "to enlighten and civilize them." In 
1877 the Chief Commissioner (like the Inspector of Education already quoted in the late 1880,G) did not wish most of
the Indian students to view "an appointment in the public service" to be "looked upon as a reward
for study." Yet many students in the Central Provinces continued to regard education as the road
into government jobs,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators discovered the 
agricultural middle class, whom the British wanted most to
educate, were not generally interested in this educational opportunity. In the context of the 1860's
policy statement "agricultural middle class" consisted of the large and small landlords. The
majority of the these and their children remained indifferent to the Western-style education offered
them. Another type of "agricultural middle class," however, who took advantage of these
educational opportunities included rural government officials; such as the patwaris (village tax
accountants), landlord agents and their assistants, and banias or the money lenders, together with
their assistants, the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">munims</SPAN>. 
The character of the Agricultural School in Nagpur gives evidence of
this trend. The School was established in the early 1900's with three sections, one for the training
of land Revenue subordinates, another for

<P>++Page 126 

<P>the instruction of Primary Schoolmasters, and a third for providing the "sons of agriculturalists
with a practical training in farming."<a name="RN29"></a><A HREF="#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  The 
weakest part of the school (which became a  three-year
college in 19051906) was the section intended to  provide practical training for sons of landlords.
By 1907-1908 the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administration 
Report</SPAN> admitted that the results of this section were not as
good as originally hoped; students were especially reluctant to participate in the manual work that
was a part of its practical training. The next year the 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administration Report</SPAN> declared that the
results of the mulguzari class were "most disappointing" as "it had been from the beginning."
Further <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administration 
Reports</SPAN> for 1911-1912 and 1912-1913 observed that the Agricultural
School was still not attracting many students from the agricultural castes. On the other hand, the
section to train revenue subordinates appears to have functioned well, though few, if any, of the
recruits for that section came from the malguzars.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These observations are 
further substantiated at the Primary education level. The
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Administration 
Report</SPAN> of 1902-1903 commented that

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction has been 
pushed on in new subjects of a practical nature which are intended
chiefly for the benefit of the cultivating class, such as village records, the use of village
maps, the nature of the soils in the village area, the tenancy rights, manuscript reading, and
Bania accounts.<a name="RN30"></a><A HREF="#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>

<P>++Page 127  

<P>Schoolmasters called in local patwaris and banias to assist in these subjects, and it appears that it
was mostly children of patwaris, banias, agents of the landlords, and others closely related, who
benefitted from this instruction, rather than the sons of landlords, tenants, and agricultural
laborers. This first goal had not been achieved in the way it was intended.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having failed to reach their 
goals with regard to education for the malguzars, their second
goal, that of using them to serve as a "lever" to raise the educational standard of the lower Classes
was in jeopardy. There is no indication that those agriculturalists who did take advantage of the
educational opportunities that were offered, the rural officials and agents, became that "lever" to
uplift the masses. Rather, the lower classes remained the most uneducated section of the
population. As in other instances, British intentions and ideas to educate the lower classes were
not matched by successful implementation. The low caste Chamars of Chattisgarh. Division
provide one example. They comprised more than one-sixth of the population of that Division,
living mostly in the central agricultural area of the Chattisgarh plain where they were
predominately tenants and agricultural laborers. More than half of the Chamars associated
themselves with the Satnami (True Religion) reform sect, thus rejecting their usual "untouchable"
status.<a name="RN31"></a><A HREF="#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1868 the Chattisgarh 
Chamars were first brought to the attention of the provincial
administration when the Divisional Commissioner requested 
special permission to obtain some
land for the establishment of a

<P>++Page 128

<P>Christian mission among them. He said an American missionary, Mr. Lohr, would supervise the
effort among the Satnamis who were "desirous of religious 
instruction."<a name="RN32"></a><A HREF="#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  The Chief
Commissioner, however, objected to approve any special concession for a missionary effort; he
felt his sanction would be "unpopular" among the bulk of the Hindu population who looked with
"much disfavor" on the Chamars. He speculated that his approval might provide an opportunity
for Hindus to accuse "the administration of leaning unduly to the religion of the ruling race," or
Christianity.<a name="RN33"></a><A HREF="#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  Soon afterward the 
same Divisional Commissioner requested support for a teacher-training school 
among the Chamars with Mr. Lohr as the headmaster. He felt such a school would
be beneficial as the large Chamar population was backward and desired education, and it was
known they received bad treatment in the schools managed by Brahmins, Kayasths, Muslims and
others. Again his request was denied for the same 
reasons.<a name="RN34"></a><A HREF="#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chattisgarh area 
remained one of the most backward areas of the Central Province
particularly in education. In 1875 the Inspector General of Education complained that the
Chattisgarhi malguzars were particularly problematic as they could not be trusted to pay the
school masters regularly. The Inspector-General. viewed the Chattisgathi people as "backward,"
living "cheaply," and caring "little for knowledge of any kind not connected with their daily
work."<a name="RN35"></a><A HREF="#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>

<P>++Page 129

<P>The problem was worst in Simga tahsil, where almost one-fifth of the population was Chamar. In
1884 the problem of collecting the education subscription became so acute that the administration
decided to close one-third of the 1-10 primary schools. Almost all the schools closed were in
predominately Chamar villages, where the administration felt the people were of a bad character
and hostile to education.<a name="RN36"></a><A HREF="#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  
Chattisgarh made a proposal for promoting education among the
Chamars but the Chief Commissioner replied 
that provision was already being made for them in
the general scheme of primary education 
expansion.<a name="RN37"></a><A HREF="#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other attempts by local 
British administrators to promote lower caste education generally
met with failure. In Chanda District, the local high school was closed when some low caste Dher
boys, who had passed the entrance examination, tried to enter the school. Though the District
Commissioner supported the attempt, all the other high caste boys resigned from the school.
Eventually the school was revived as a Zillah school with full 
attendance.<a name="RN38"></a><A HREF="#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  As late as 1917,
however, the Central Province administration refused to remove specific restrictions on the
admission of low caste girls into schools. While it favored admitting them, in principal, it left their
admission and thereby the implementation of

<P>++Page 130

<P>their policy to local officials to deal with as the applications 
were received.<a name="RN39"></a><A HREF="#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases under review 
reflect some of the more general and persistent attitudes of the
provincial government toward lower class, and especially low caste education. Though in
principle it seemed often to hold to the ideal of educational opportunities for most of the
population, it did not strongly commit itself to promote education among the lower classes. At the
divisional and district levels, British administrators sometimes attempted to implement educational
opportunities for specific lower castes in their areas. These effort. often met with opposition or
indifference from British administrators at the provincial level and strong opposition and rejection
by local higher castes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another large category 
of the Central Province population received almost the same
treatment from British rulers as was given the low castes. They were the tribal groups who totaled
almost one-fourth of the population in the province. They lived in the mom inaccessible areas and
were comparatively backward in education. Though a few British officials and foreign
missionaries from time to time labored to promote education among them, such efforts were
minute in comparison to the general educational efforts in the province. Some British attitudes
toward tribal groups also may have limited British concern for education among them, The
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Central Provinces 
Gazetteer</SPAN> (1908) in its summary of the educational position of various
segments of the population admitted that only three percent of the tribal boys of school age were
in school. The <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Gazetteer</SPAN>

<P>++Page 131

<P>contended that it was difficult to persuade "the forest tribes to send their children to school, and
even when the children do go it is probable that only a few of them have sufficient powers of
concentration to learn successfully."<a name="RN40"></a><A HREF="#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  
Such attitudes among British officials would not reflect a
serious effort to promote education among tribal groups. Literacy and caste statistics of the early
twentieth century provide further evidence that the educational growth of the first six decades in
the Central Provinces benefitted mainly the higher-caste private and government professionals at
the expense of the rural malguzars and lower classes, and the forest tribes. Literacy rates in the
Central Provinces and Berar were 3.3 percent in 1911 and 4.8 percent in 
1921.<a name="RN41"></a><A HREF="#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  The three castes
with the highest literacy rates (between 24 to 35 percent) were Brahmins, Kayasths, and Banias.
A tribal group such as the Gonds had only a 1.1 percent literacy among its males and .1 percent
among its females. Brahmins were an exceptionally well-educated though a relatively small caste
category, consisting of around 450 thousand or around 3 percent of the provincial population. Yet
in 1912 the number of Brahmin students in higher education, 2,280, exceeded the number of all
other castes combined, 
1,970.<a name="RN42"></a><A HREF="#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A>  They monopolized

<P>and were said to fill 74 percent of government posts above menial 
positions.<a name="RN43"></a><A HREF="#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  The correlation of
high caste with high literacy is revealed also at the district level. The Narbudda Valley district of
Hoshangabad had a high literacy rate of 6.9 percent in 1921; its percentage of twice born caste
population was also high, (20 percent). The forest district of Balaghat had a low literacy rate of
3.4 percent; for it had a large forest tribal population, (25 percent). Bilaspur district in Chattisgarh
with a high percentage of "impure castes", (30 percent) had the lowest literacy rate, (2.6 percent).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four conclusions emerge 
from the history of education during the first six decades of the
Central Provinces administration. First, educational institutions, the number of students, and funds
all showed an increase during this period, but the increase was sporadic and was related to British
administrative support. Increase and expansion was greatest in the first and last decades when
British support was strongest both in idealized policy and in implementation. During the middle
decades the British became disillusioned. They were adversely criticized for compulsive methods
of promoting education. They withdraw support through executive British officers and transferred
the implementation to departmental officials, most of whom were Indians. The British became
dissatisfied with the slow educational development and with the type of education which seemed
to produce an abundance of Indians seeking government jobs. The divergence between British
policy and implementation was greatest during the middle period. The educational resurgence of
the last decade

<P>++Page 134

<P>resulted in  literacy rate of 5 percent in 1921.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, educational 
development unevenly affected different segments of the C. P.
population. Originally the British considered the educational advancement of three segments: the
agricultural middle class, the lower classes, and subordinate Indian officials. Whereas the British
stressed the first two segments, it was the last segment and their counterparts in the economy
which achieved the greatest literacy. At the village level and above they held positions as patwaris,
banias, and agents of landlords. British attempts to attract and educate the agrarian middle-class
of landlords, the malguzars, generally met with very limited success. Lower castes and forest
tribes were even more illiterate. Local British officers who tried to promote education among
lower castes often found their efforts were opposed by higher 
castes and by the provincial administration for one reason or mother. 
An examination of these reasons indicates that the provincial
administration in implementing policies allied themselves with higher castes and did little to
remove prejudices against lower castes, by word or action. At the end of these decades, in 1921,
literacy was most concentrated among Indians in intermediate administrative and economic
positions midway between the colonial structure above and the agrarian society below.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third conclusion arises 
from the second. Education gained a greater significance in a
colonial society based on a literate bureaucracy. British rule depended on documentation and
statistics to form policy, make laws, and decide court cases. British administrators came to rely
heavily on a literate, subordinate Indian bureaucracy to supply these. Villagers, an the other hand,
had to rely on literate persons to

<P>++Page 135

<P>supply and read various documents for them; documents concerning land rights, contracts for
debts, or other legal information. In the context of British rule literacy implied power: power
better to understand and control relationships with the British colonial structure above and Indians
below.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, this review of 
education in the Central Provinces between 1861 and 1921 reaffirms
the analytical framework of the beginning of this chapter. The promotion of education under
British rule was limited by several factors: by a minimal financial commitment, by the divergence
between ideals and results, between policy and implementation, and between provincial and
district level British officials. Education directly affected only a small number of Indians, though it
indirectly affected a much larger number. In such an agricultural society, British officials often
expressed a hope that education would stimulate agricultural production. But, as the practical
schemes for agricultural education in the primary schools and the Agricultural College reveal,
education did not increase agricultural production, rather it strengthened the position of Indians at
the intermediate level in the government and economy, which in turn reinforced the colonial
structure rather than change it. Education thus helped consolidate British rule rather than promote
development.
