<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"> <b><i>My Life: A Fragment,</i> authored
by Mohamed Ali, reflects the fears, anxieties and aspirations of many
educated Muslims who lived through the first two decades after the death
of Syed Ahmad Khan in 1898. It is also an important personal statement,
a document of deep religious feeling which serves to illuminate Mohamed
Ali's inner self-awareness of Islam. For this reason, his book invites
comparison with other texts written around the same time in other
countries by Muslim scholars and publicists. Its historical value,
having long been recognised by historians of Indian nationalism and
Indian Islam, is enhanced by the absence of a similar text written in
India by any other leading actor of the
period.</b></SPAN></td></tr></table>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><b>At a time when social scientists are
engaged with the overriding theme of identity politics and with issues
of identity-formation in South Asia, Mohamed Ali's insights enable us to
understand how a specifically Muslim identity was being constructed in
early twentieth century north India. This is particularly so at a time
wheh scholars are also trying to come to terms with , communal' or
communitarian solidarities and their role in the private and public
domains.  Finally, <i>My Life: A Fragment</i> illumines how influential
public figures like Mohamed Ali reflected on the changes ushered in by
the colonial government and their impact on his community and the
nation.</b></SPAN>

<center><b>Preface</b></center>

<P>Since its publication in January 1942, Mohamed Ali's <EM>My Life: A
Fragment</EM> has been widely read and used by scholars and generalists
alike. In the subcontinent, it is regarded as a major statement by one
of the chief protagonists of various Muslim causes.  The authenticity of
the book, which was originally entitled 'Islam: Kingdom of God', is not
in doubt. Its distinct style is consistent with the tone and tenor of
its author's letters, articles and speeches.

<P>Afzal Iqbal was the first to edit the manuscript. He had received it in 
1939 from Mohammad Mujeeb, the scholar and later vice-chancellor of 
Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia. Mujeeb, who had been 
impressed with Mohamed Ali in the early 1920s when he met
him in London as a student, became highly critical of the man and his 
mission in later years. Having lost interest in editing 'Islam:
Kingdom of God'. the title Mohamed Ali gave to the book in the making, 
he would have probably agreed to part with the typescript.
'To this slim and impressive intellectual,' wrote Afzal Iqbal in his 
introduction to the' newly-coined title <EM>My Life: A Fragment,</EM>
'I looked for help which he gave me ungrudgingly and in full measure.'

<P>Mohamed Ali was a prolific writer from his student days at Aligarh. 
Yet he did not consider writing a book until he was
interned in 1923, along with Shaukat Ali (1873-1938) and others, 
after the Karachi trial. On 23 July 1916, he wrote from
Chhindwara, then a small and inaccessible town in the 
Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), to Abdul Majid 
Daryabadi (1892-1997), one of his numerous admirers at the time:

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
You suggest to me that I should write a book during my enforced leisure, 
and that our people expect one from me. If that is so, I
am afraid they don't know me. Firstly, I have neither the patience, 
perseverance nor the temper of the researchist [sic]. Secondly,
my emotions are much too strong to permit what intellect I may 
possess to be exerted in the writing of a book.... No, my friend, my
brain is far too busy (and so is my heart) to allow of any leisure 
for such 'pastimes' as authorship. (Abdul Majid Daryabadi Papers,
Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi)</SPAN>

<P>Soon after being convicted in Karachi, Mohamed Ali set out 
to write a biography of the Prophet of Islam. But he did not make
much progress. He then began writing a multi-volume history of 
Islam. Having completed the first part in gaol, he was caught up
in the political controversies and [<b>++Page 10 Preface</b>] 

could not therefore complete the book. 'Curiously enough,' Afzal 
Iqbal writes, 'Mohamed Ali had never meant to write the present
book. He started with the life of the Prophet and ended with his own.' 
He did, however, write a great deal more than many of his
contemporaries. He wrote hundreds of routine letters as editor of the 
<EM>Comrade</EM> and <EM>Hamdard,</EM> poems to fill a not-so-slim volume,
and miscellaneous historical, literary and political pieces to 
fill another (Rais Ahmad Jafri (ed.), <EM>Selections from Mohamed Ali's
Comrade,</EM> Lahore, 1965; and his <EM>Ifadat-i Mohamed Ali,</EM> 
n.d.; Mohammad Sarwar (ed.), <EM>Mazameen-i Mohamed Ali,</EM> in 2 vols., 193
8). During his internment (191 1-May 1915; 1921-3) and trips 
to Europe, he wrote regularly to friends and family members,
detailing his routine in gaol, reporting meetings with people 
who travelled from far and wide to meet him, and dwelling at length
on his encounters with various officials in jail (Mushirul Hasan 
(ed.), <EM>Mohamed Ali in Indian Politics,</EM> in 3 vols.; Shan Muhammad
(ed.) <EM>Unpublished Letters of the Ali Brothers,</EM> 1979; 
and Abu Salman Shahjahanpuri (ed.), <EM>Siyasi Maktubat Rais-al-Ahrar,</EM> 1978).
In Europe, where he met scores of public figures and addressed 
numerous meetings from January to September 1920, he shared
his experiences with brother Shaukat and friends (Mohammad 
Sarwar, <EM>Maulana Mohamed Ali Ka Europe Ka Safar,</EM> 1943).

<P>Mohamed Ali's letters, now mostly published, constitute a 
major corpus of pan-Islamic literature in the subcontinent and
uncover major themes that concerned his generation of educated 
Muslims. The tone in his correspondence constantly varies from
boredom and depression, on the one hand, to exhilaration and 
conviction on the other, now relaxed and desultory, now indulging
in flights of fantasy or burlesque. A flair for the dramatic, 
coupled with a wry self-awareness, a temperament that allowed the fullest
reins to intellectual enthusiasm while never really realising 
personal ones. This complexity is also revealed in his speeches.

<P><EM>My Life: A Fragment</EM> is an important personal 
statement on how some educated Muslims lived through the turbulent decades
following the death of Syed Ahmad Khan in 1889. It mirrors 
their fears and aspirations, as ,also their commitment to the political
and intellectual regeneration of the Muslim communities in 
the subcontinent. It is, above all, a reflective account of an individual's
intellectual and spiritual journey at a time when the anxieties 
of several Muslim groups were heightened by a number of
developments in India and the world of Islam. For this reason, 
<EM>My Life is</EM> a document of deep religious feeling and serves to
illuminate Mohamed Ali's inner self-awareness of Islam. Its 
author did not claim to be an authority on Islam, but considered his
'first duty' to share his reading and [<b>Preface ++Page 11</b>] 

understanding with fellow-Muslims. In his own words: 
'Experts often write for experts, but I am so to speak, "the man- in-the-
street". The individual experience which I relate wiI4 make 
this clear, and being typical of the history of so many Muslim lives of
my generation, it will not, I trust, be altogether lacking in interest.'

<P>Again,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
I have now said all that I need say about my religious antecedents 
and my present attitude towards Islam and its theology and I fear
I have said it at much greater length than I wished, and would have 
done if I had been able to devote more time that expression and
concentration require. But an inherent and almost ineradicable 
<EM>[sic]</EM> tendency towards diffusion and a fatal attraction for tangents
found a good ally in the condition of my prison life when work at a 
stretch. . . , was impossible and only snippets of time were
available for dashing off a few scores of lines at a time. Doubtful 
as I feel about completing my task I feel almost certain that even
if I am enabled to do so within a reasonable time I would not have 
the leisure for any but the rapidest revision before I hand over
the manuscript to the printers. But in the circumstances of which 
now the reader shares the knowledge with the writer, he thinks
he can rely on a generous measure of the reader's indulgence.</SPAN>

<P>The importance of <EM>My Life is</EM> 
enhanced by the absence of a similar text written by any 
other leading actor of the period. Shibli
Nomani (18571914) wrote a great deal, but he died long before 
the excitement caused by the Khilafat issue. Maulana Abul Kalam
Azad (1888-1958) did not write much besides his commentary 
on the Quran. Jawaharlal Nehru (1889-1964), an admirer of the
Maulana's scholarship, noted in his prison diary: 'Free thinker 
and magnificent writer as he is, he should have turned out a host of
splendid books. Yet his record is a very limited one' (Christmas Day, 1942, 
<EM>Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, S.</EM> Gopal (ed.),
vol. 13, p. 39).

<P>At a time when scholars are attempting to 
delineate the contours of Muslim identity in South Asia, Mohamed Ali's <EM>My Life
</EM>enables us to understand how some Muslim 
constructed their identity in a colonial context. For this reason, this book invites
comparison with other texts written around the same 
time in other countries by Muslim scholars and publicists. At a time when
scholars are concerned to unravel the complexity of 
'communal' or communitarian identities, it is important to consider how
Mohamed Ali reflected on a society that was being 
gradually transformed by far-reaching political, administrative and bureaucratic
changes.

<P>A final editorial point: I have neither modified nor altered 
the printed text, even though the narrative is often verbose,
incoherent, repetitive and full of digressions. I have merely 
changed some chapter sub-headings [<b>++Page 12 Preface</b>] 

(e.g. 'At Mother's Knee' instead of 'At the Mother's Knee; 'Aligarh's 
<EM>raison d'etre'</EM> instead 
of 'Aligarh and its <EM>raison d'etre'),</EM> rectified
the printing errors, and standardised the spellings, e.g. 
Kanpur for Cawnpore; Awadh for Oudh; Quran for Qur'an; <EM>madaris</EM> 
for <EM>madarsahs;</EM> Matthew for Mathew(s); <EM>makatib</EM> for 
<EM>maktabs;</EM> Medina for Madinah; Umayyad for Omayyad. I have italicised Arabic,
Persian and Urdu words and introduced biographical and explanatory 
notes to make Mohamed Ali's account accessible to the
readers.

<P><a href="iframe.html">The introduction</a>, based in part on 
the arguments and materials 
presented in my previous publications, has appeared in the
volume <EM>Islam, Community and the Nation: Muslim Identities in 
South Asia and Beyond</EM> (Delhi, 1998). Biographical and explanatory
notes are based on: <EM>Shorter Encyclopaedia of1slam,</EM> 
edited by H. A.R. Gibb and J.H. Kramers (Leiden, 1974); <EM>The Cambridge

<P>I appreciate the help and advice of Alok Bhalla and Aziz al-Azmeh. 
Their intellectual support spurred me to edit this book.
I am grateful to a large number of people, especially Professor 
Wolf Lepenies, the Rector of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin
(Institute for Advanced Study Berlin). For their courtesy and 
ungrudging help at the Wissenschaftskolleg, I am much obliged to
Barbara Sanders, Corina Pertschi, Christine von Arnim, 
Mrs Gesine Bottomley, Anja Brockmann and their colleagues in the Fellow
Services and the Library. Doris Reichel made life easy 
with the computer. Elissa Linke scanned, edited and formatted the book for
me. I am greatly indebted to her.
