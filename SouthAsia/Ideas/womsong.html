<TR><TD><a name="forg"><STRONG>1. FORGIVE US, ANITA DEWAN</STRONG></a>
<br>
by Suman Chatterjee</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>[<EM>Anita Dewan was a social worker who was raped and brutally
murdered by hoodlums in Bantala, a poor neighborhood in suburban
Calcutta</EM>.]<br></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
I hear the cries time and again<BR>
Cries that my heart penetrate<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit inside my body<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit within my head.<BR><BR>

Foul and filthy Bantala is but<BR>
Another Calcutta neighborhood<BR>
Three women are assaulted with<BR>
Three hundred men in pursuit.<BR><BR>

Manhood now makes me shameful<BR>
Before myself I hang my head<BR>
The blood of the three women sits<BR>
In our conscience, still and dead.<BR><BR>

Does Anita Dewan's carcass<BR>
Make Civility feel some shame?<BR>
I have put my shame in song<BR>
You can, for yourself, do the same.<BR><BR>

I hear cries time and again<BR>
Cries that my heart penetrate<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit inside my body<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit within my head.<BR><BR>

The real mark of barbarism lies<BR>
In this silence of heads without torso<BR>
Calcutta, meanwhile, dances dirty,<BR>
Celebrates three hundred years or so.<BR><BR>

Your enjoyment puts me to shame<BR>
A shame that is too, too dogged<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit inside my body<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit within my head.<BR><BR>

There's blood in your new apartments<BR>
In water faucets, at dusk and dawn,<BR>
It's the blood of raped women that flows,<BR>
Blood telling tales of the land goes on.<BR><BR>

Look! it's blood upon the snack-bar,<BR>
On your mutton-roll! it's blood<BR>
It is, again, sprinkled blood that<BR>
My bowl of fish curry floods.<BR><BR>

The same invisible blood has now<BR>
The flag of the same color wetted<BR>
The colored world of politics<BR>
Is stained in blood unabetted.<BR><BR>

Anita Dewan's blood will not<BR>
Erase itself, it is so obstinate<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit inside my body<BR>
Martyrs' pulpit in my head.<BR><BR>

Blood is on your raga Malkosh<BR>
Blood is in your music chambers<BR>
The harmonium's wet with blood<BR>
Blood rehearses melodic numbers.<BR><BR>

Blood stains your culture and<BR>
Blood is in your juvenile memory<BR>
There's blood even in Tagore-songs<BR>
Rape becomes your identity.<BR><BR>

Covering blood with painted design<BR>
Is that your civilized barbarity?<BR>
I am of the same order, too,<BR>
I am Calcutta; the mega-city.<BR>

<TD><a name="paap"><STRONG>2. PAAPRI  DE</STRONG></a>
<br>
by Suman Chatterjee</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>[<EM>Paapri De was a four year old girl who, after swallowing a pen-cap in play,
first suffered from lack of treatment and then died when a certain Dr. Mal
injected her with adult dose tranquilizers since it was very late at night.</EM>]<BR></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
Little Paapri is too foolish<BR>
Ate something other than food<BR>
That's how in the little throat<BR>
The pain got stuck and stood.<BR><BR>

Gulp it down little girl, gulp<BR>
The pain stopping your breath<BR>
Life in this land only means<BR>
Swallowing the pain of death.<BR><BR>

Little Paapri is too foolish<BR>
A little dull, I have to say,<BR>
Else she'd know such things<BR>
Are happening everyday.<BR><BR>

Little Paapri is too foolish<BR>
Hasn't learnt to swallow pain,<BR>
How dare you spend, little girl,<BR>
The country's time in vain!<BR><BR>

Little Paapri is too foolish<BR>
The medical tools are gone<BR>
Out-of-order; so what?<BR>
Democracy lives on!<BR><BR>

"Little Paapri is too foolish,"<BR>
Thinks Doctor Mal,<BR>
"Why be a doctor this late,<BR>
With no sleep at all?"<BR><BR>

Sleep, little Paapri, go to sleep.<BR>
Why at all were you born ever?<BR>
I've made and sung my song,<BR>
Now with a sigh I'll slumber.<BR>

<TD><a name="whac"><STRONG>3. WHACK! THE SUN SLAPPED...</STRONG></a><br>
by Suman Chatterjee</TD></TR>

<TR>
</TD><TD>
Whack! the Sun slapped the Sky across the face<BR>
Scared Dawn, unwillingly, stays out of the race.<BR>
Understandably flushed is the Cloud's forehead<BR>
While Morning smiles like a girl newly wed.<BR><BR>

Smile, my Morning, the newly wedded bride,<BR>
You'd remember if you really were a bride<BR>
In this country your father had to sell his land,<BR>
To make you a bride on another man's demand.<BR><BR>

Your man took his dowries without a blush<BR>
Hard cash, jewelries and a shoe shining brush<BR>
Because the skin of your face is quite like a shoe<BR>
The scars on your face must be kept shining, too!<BR><BR>

The scars on your heart you'd hide with a smile<BR>
(This country is, after all, a foreign land defiled)<BR>
Lying on the bed that was your father's gratuity,<BR>
With a smile you would rip apart your virginity.<BR><BR>

In this land that swears upon the Mother goddess<BR>
Hair flowing, you'd rock your baby without recess.<BR>
Rock, you would yourself time and time again<BR>
Your father died with your dowry unattained.<BR><BR>

But your kid's father wouldn't stand such a flaw;<BR>
An undowried groom is no less than a tiger's paw!<BR>
One day, graced with the same tiger-paw's blessing,<BR>
Hung by your neck, you'd dangle from the ceiling...<BR><BR>

As a ghoul, you'd see your dangling corpse turn<BR>
And laugh as the night would fade into morn.<BR>
The Morn has blushed, actually, out of shame;<BR>
Has turned to the Sun for justice, all the same....<BR><BR>

And having seen the plight of the human race<BR>
Whack! the Sun slapped the Sky across the face.<BR>

In response to Heather Dell's posting, here are the texts of three songs on
women and violence by Suman Chatterjee (a political singer from Calcutta)
that I have translated.  At Frank Conlon's suggestion, I do want to make
clear that these translations are under <b>copyright</b>, but may be used for
