Bihar is a predominantly agricultural State with 86 per cent of
her population depending upon agriculture. In my study of the National
Income of Bihar published in the <b>Indian Journal of Economics</b>, July 1951,
I had estimated the gross agricultural income of Bihar for the year
1846-47 at Rs. 230 crores, basing myself on the statistics published in
the <b><i>Season and Crop Report</i></b>, and at Rs. 272 crores when based on the
statistics contained in the <b>Crop Survey Report</b>. In the present study
I have estimated the agricultural income of Bihar not on the figures
of production for a single year, viz., 1946-47, as I had done in my study
of the national income of Bihar, but on the average of four years'
figures, viz., 1945-46 to 1948-49. Out of the 19 agricultural products
that I have considered, figures of production for the four years, 1945-46
to 1948-49, are not available for five crops, viz., linseed, rape and mustard,
sesamum, castor and cotton; and for these crops I had to utilise the
figures for a single year, viz., 1949-50. For all the 19 crops, however, 
I have utilised the figures arrived at by the new system of crop estimation by
complete survey which was introduced in Bihar in 1945-46; 
and the results of which for the first three years were published in the 
<b>Crop Survey Report</b>. I have, however, valued the production at 1946-47 
prices, as I had done in my study of the national income of Bihar, only 
with very slight revisions.<p> 
 
     I should point out at the very outset that the figures of agricultural 
income that I have arrived at, are subject to a considerable margin of 
error. Even the figures of acreage under different crops, although these 
are supposed to be based on complete enumeration survey, are perhaps 
not quite accurate. But even assuming that the figures of area are 
correct, the figures of outturn of crops are likely to contain a large element 
of error. Out of the 19 crops considered, production is estimated on 
the basis of crop cutting experiments only in the case of four crops, 
viz., paddy, wheat, gram and masoor; while for the remaining 15 crops 
the figures of production are based on eye estimation which is coloured 
largely by the personal bias of the estimator. The figures of production 
which are arrived at by multiplying the area under a particular crop 
by the yield per acre of that crop, thus contain two sources of error, 
viz. the error in the figures of acreage and the error in the estimation 
of yield per acre; and these two errors may not be of a compensating <p>
 

<b>++Page 34  THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS (1953) </b><p>
 
nature. Moreover, the outturn of the crop is liable to much grease 
variations from year to year than the variations in its acreage. Thus 
even during the short space of 4 years covered by the study, I have 
frequently come across cases where the outturn of a crop in a district 
was double, or even treble, the outturn in the previous year; and 
although I have taken the average production over a period of four years 
yet even four years is too short a period to indicate the normal outturn 
of a crop in a district. Finally, the valuation of the product introduced 
a third source of error in the prices by which the quantity produced 
has to be multiplied. For 10 of the 19 crops, I have utilised the harvest
prices for the year 1946-47 as given in the Season and Crop Report for 
that year. I am not sure that these figures are absolutely reliable 
But for the remaining 9 crops, the figures of prices were not available 
in the <b>Season and Crop Report</b>, and were only arrived at indirectly 
and may thus contain even a larger source of error than in the prices 
published in the <b>Season and Crop Report</b>. Thus a computation of 
agricultural income must be subject to much greater sources of error than 
computation of the acreage or outturn of crops. <p>

     The 19 crops considered here account for 88 per cent of the gross 
area sown in Bihar, and the remaining 12 per cent of the cropped area 
consists of area under the millets (such as marua, jowar and bajra, 
tea, vegetables other than potato, etc. It should be noted that the total 
area sown, as given in the <b>Crop Survey Report</b>, excludes the area under 
orchards (which includes area under fruit trees, such as mango, banana, 
litchis, etc.); while the total area sown as given in the Season and Crop 
Report, includes the area under fruits. Since I have utilised the figures 
of the former report as being more accurate of the two, the area under 
fruits would have been excluded even if the crops grown in 100 per cent 
of the cropped area had been included. As it was, I had to content 
myself with the crops grown on only 88 per cent of the cropped area, 
as figures of acreage, production and prices were not available for crops 
grown on the remaining 12 per cent of the sown area. No attempt has 
been made to include the value of forest produce, animal products, 
fisheries, etc. in the computation of the agricultural income. <p>
 
     For the 10 main crops, I have valued the production of each district 
by taking the harvest price for that district, as given in the <b>Season and Crop
Report</b>; for sugarcane, I have taken a uniform price for all districts. 
It is the price fixed by Government at which sugar factories were 
required to purchase cane from cane-growers during the season 1946-47. 
For arhar, the wholesale prices ruling at the headquarters of the different 
districts in 1946-47 have been utilised; and for masoor, khesari, peas,
chillies, potatoes, sesamum and castor, one uniform price for each of 
these crops has been used in valuing the production of all the districts. 
in the absence of separate price data for each district. It should further<p>
    

<b>++Page 35    AGRICULTURAL INCOME AND ITS DISTRIBUTION IN BIHAR (1953)</b><p>

be noted that it is the primary production that has been valued; and 
the value added by subsequent processing of the crops (such as the 
conversion of cane into gur) has been excluded as far as possible. The 
price taken into consideration is the price which the growers received 
for the crop, and which is normally substantially lower than the whole- 
sale price of the crop at district headquarters. It is needless to add 
that although the entire outturn of the crops has been valued, it is not 
fact that the entire output is brought to the market and passes through 
the pale of money economy. It is only in the case of cash crops that 
almost the entire output is marketed; but for most of the other crops, 
only a moiety of the amount produced is sold for cash. The following 
table shows the amount (in lakhs of maunds) of the different crops 
produced in Bihar together with their aggregate money value (in lakhs 
or rupees), the share of each crop in the total value of crops produced, 
and the average price (per maund) of each crop:-- <p><pre>

     The table brings out the overwhelming importance of rice in our 
agricultural economy. Paddy constituted 54 per cent of the total volume and 
42 per cent of the total value of agricultural production in Bihar. Oilseeds 
and cotton are of very little significance in Bihar. Our high priced 
crops are the cash crops; tobacco, chillies and jute; while the low priced 
crops are sugarcane, khesari and maize. Bearing in mind that varying 
proportions of different crops are marketed, a scheme of weights based <p>

     The largest areas of cultivated land are in Gaya, Ranchi, Santal 
Pargana and Shahabad districts, while Singhbhum, Palamau and Patna 
districts have the smallest cropped areas. <p>
 

<b>++Page 37. AGRICULTURAL INCOME AND ITS DISTRIBUTION IN BIHAR (1953)</b><p>
 
     The figures given above show that the proportion of the total area 
that is cultivated varies greatly from district to district, from 77.5 per 
cent in the district of Muzaffarpur, to only 14.8 per cent in the district 
of Palamau It is generally low in the hilly tracts of the Chotanagpur 
division which are, however, rich in forest and mineral resources. The 
high production per acre in Saran and Champaran districts is mainly 
attributable to the concentration of sugarcane production in these districts 
the two districts between them account for almost half the sugarcane 
produced in Bihar). Monghyr, Ranchi, Palamau, Bhagalpur and 
Hazaribagh districts show the lowest yield per acre. Although Champaran 
and Saran take the pride of place in respect of the volume of production, 
they are low down in the list (12th and 10th respectively) in respect 
of the value of produce raised. This is mainly due to these two districts 
concentrating on the production of sugarcane which is a low priced 
crop. The district with the highest value of agricultural production 
is Purnea, mainly because of its concentration in the production of high 
priced crops like jute and tobacco. Shahabad comes second; while, 
curiously enough, the third place is taken by Bhagalpur district, which 
has a very low production per acre; but where prices generally are 
higher than in other districts. The table on page 38 shows how the 
production of each crop is distributed among the different districts of Bihar. <p>
 
     The table shows that the production of cash crops in Bihar 
is highly concentrated in certain regions. Thus, sugarcane is localised 
in Saran and Champaran, jute in Purnea, cotton in Saran, Ranchi and 
Palamau, tobacco in Muzaffarpur and Purnea, and chillies in Darbhanga 
and Monghyr districts. The crop which shows the least concentration 
is rice The totals of the percentage production of all the 19 crops in 
each district give the following results:-<p><pre>

=======================================================================</pre>

     It thus appears that although the largest volume of agricultural 
production is to be found in the Champaran district, the most represen- 
ative agricultural district in Bihar (growing almost all the crops in 
appreciable quantities) is Saran, which also claims the largest total 
Production per acre of sown area. Singhbhum is the least representative 
agricultural district in Bihar. <p>

produce in Bihar, or, if we take 100 per cent of the sown area, Rs. 271 <p>

crores worth of agricultural porduce, the licensed money lenders 
advanced in 1948-49 Rs. 10.88 crores (of which only four per cent 
constituted unsecured loans); Government advanced Rs. 0.35 crores under 
the Agriculturists Loans Act, 1884 and Rs. 0.19 crores under the Land 
Improvement Loans Act, 1883 and the Agricultural Co-operative Credit 
societies advanced a paltry sum of Rs. 6.1 lakhs in 1948-49. The advances 
made by scheduled and non-scheduled banks for agricultural purposes 
in Bihar could not have exceeded on 31st December 1950 a sum of Rs. 30 
lakhs. It may be noted that a considerable proportion of the money 
advanced by registered money lenders is borrowed for non-agricultural 
purposes such as marriages, sradhs, illness, etc. No doubt a substantial 
sum is advanced by unlicensed money lenders, and perhaps not all the 
unsecured loans advanced by licensed money lenders are shown in the 
returns; yet it must be admitted that considering the aggregate value 
of the produce raised, the credit facilities available to the cultivators 
ere meagre. <p>
 
     It would be interesting to compare the agricultural income accruing 
in each district of Bihar, with the agricultural income assessable to 
Agricultural Income-Tax. It should be noted that for arriving at the 
assessable income for taxation under the A.I.T. Act, a number of 
deductions are made from the gross agricultural income. Thus deductions 
are allowed for the payment of land revenue, rent, local cess, chowkidari 
tax, irrigation charges, rent collection charges, expenses for the 
maintenance of irrigation works, interest on mortgages and expenses of 
cultivation including transport to market and maintenance of implements
end cattle. Incomes below Rs. 5,000/- were originally exempted from 
taxation, but the limit was subsequently reduced to Rs. 3,500/-. The 
income is taxed either at the place where the income accrues, or at the 
place where the assessee resides, at the option of the assessee. The 
following table compares the value of the crops raised in each district 
of Bihar with the agricultural income (above Rs. 5,000/-) which was 
assessed to tax in each district (excepting the district of Monghyr for 
which figures were not available). <p>
 
     There were 1928 assessees in Bihar (excluding the Monghyr district) 
in 1948-49 Thus only 1.6 per cent of the gross agricultural income 
was subjected to the tax. There is hardly any correlation between the 
two sets of figures given above. Thus although the income assessed 
to tax was the highest in the Darbhanga district, this district stood only 
fifth in order of the aggregate value of agricultural produce. Purnea 
which had the highest value of agricultural production, stood sixth in 
order of the income assessed to tax. Only in the case of Bhagalpur, 
Hazaribagh and Singhbhum districts the two orders tally. A noticeable 
feature is that although both the aggregate volume and value of 
agricultural production in the Palamau district is the lowest in Bihar, yet the 
income assessed to tax in this district is almost as high as that in Shahabad <p>

<b>++Page 41. AGRICULTURAL INCOME AND ITS DISTRIBUTION IN BIHAR (1953) </b><p>
 
     The gross agricultural income per head of the agricultural classes 
varied from a maximum of Rs. 110 in Purnea and Manbhum districts, 
to Rs. 47 in Darbhanga district, with an average of Rs. 69 for the whole 
of Bihar. The high income districts are Purnea, Manbhum, Shahabad 
and Ranchi, and the low income districts are Drabhanga, Saran, Monghyr 
and Muzaffarpur. It will be noticed that the districts with high density 
of agricultural population per acre of cultivated land, such as Saran, 
Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga, have low incomes per head, while districts 
with low density of population, such as Ranchi, Santal Pargana and 
Shahabad have comparatively high incomes per head. This is, however, 
not invariably the case. Thus Gaya and Monghyr districts, with low 
tensity of population, have also low incomes per head of the 
agricultural population. An acre of sown area in Bihar supported 1.6 persons 
belonging to the agricultural classes and generated a gross income of 
Rs. 107.6 per year. The average size of a holding in Bihar is about 
3.5 acres. An average agricultural family in Bihar consisted of about 
5.5 persons who produced from an average holding a gross income of 
Rs. 377 per year, or a little more (say Rs. 430), since my calculation 
is based on 88 per cent of the sown area; and although agricultural 
production has been computed for the period 1945-46 to 1948-49, the 
population figures used relate to the year 1951. <p>

     I shall now turn to the distribution of the agricultural income among 
the different sections of the agricultural population in Bihar. The 
population census of 1951 classifies the agricultural population into four 
classes, viz., (1) cultivators of land wholly or mainly owned and their 
dependents, (2) cultivators of land wholly or mainly unowned and 
their dependents, (3) cultivating labourers and their dependents and 
(4) non-cultivating owners of land, agricultural rent receivers and their 
dependents. Taking the owners of land and rent receivers with their 
dependents first, we find that their number is given as 2.47 lakhs. The 
<b>Bihar Land Revenue Administration Report </b>gives the gross rental of 
estates and tenures in Bihar in 1948-49 as Rs. 1,883.7 lakhs. This gives 
an average income of Rs. 763 per head for this class. If an average 
family of this class consists of 5.5 persons, the gross family income 
would amount to Rs. 4,196 per year. I am somewhat doubtful about 
the validity of this figure, since although the census of 1951 gives a 
total population of 2.47 lakhs for this class, the <b>Administration Report</b> 
shows the recorded number of share-holders of estates and tenures to 
be 13.4 lakhs. The taking over of the zamindaris by the State would 
thus roughly increase the share of the State in the value of agricultural 
production from 0.6 per cent, which is the land revenue now received 
by Government' to 8 per cent, which is the gross rent now received by 
owners of estates and tenures, not taking into account the loss of 
agricultura1 income tax, etc. which would follow the assumption of 
zamindaris by the State. Coming to the class of cultivating labourers and <p>

<b>++Page 42 THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS (1953)</b><p>

their dependents, the census figures so far published, do not shot 
separately the number of earners and dependents in this class. I have, 
therefore, taken the number of earners and earning dependents from
the census of 1931, and increased their numbers in the same proportion 
in which the population of Bihar increased in the decades 1931-41 and 
1941-51. I have further assumed that an earning dependent earned half
as much as a principal earner. This gives a figure of 34.39 earners out 
of a total population of 87.95 lakhs belonging to this class, as given in  
the <b>1951 Census Report</b>. Thus a family of 5.5 persons of this class 
contained 2.13 principal earners, which is somewhat too high a figure. 
The <b>Agricultural Labour Enquiry</b> conducted in 1949-50 in 80 villages
of Bihar, gives an average daily wage rate of Rs. 1/2/9 per agricultural
labourer. Taking Rs. 1/2/- as the daily wage for this class of labour, 
and assuming a working year of 150 days, we get a total income of
Rs. 5802.9 lakhs for a total population of 87.95 lakhs, or an income of  
Rs. 66 per head of cultivating labourers and their dependents, or an  
income of Rs. 363 per family of 5.5 members. We are now left with 
the two remaining classes of cultivators of land, owned and unowned  
who together make up 255.69 lakh persons. Assuming a gross 
agricultural income of Rs. 271 crores (on the basis of 100 per cent sown area), 
and deducting from it the shares going to rent receivers and agricultural 
labourers as computed above, we are left with an income of Rs. 19,409.5 
lakhs. This gives an income of Rs. 76 per head, or Rs. 418 per family 
of 5.5 persons of the cultivating classes. It is not possible to estimate  
separately the income of cultivators with owned land and cultivators
of unowned land; for although an article entitled <i>Land Tenures in India</i> 
published by the <b>Indian Society of Agricultural Economics</b>, gives the
figure of 203.6 lakh acres cultivated by occupancy ryots and 6.6 lakh
acres cultivated by non-occupancy ryots, out of a gross sown area of 
244.8 lakh acres, the 1951 census figures give the population of those who 
mainly cultivate owned land and of those who mainly cultivate unowned  
land. It is, however, certain that the income of non-occupancy tenants 
(bataidars) is less than that of occupancy ryots but higher than that 
of agricultural labourers. This study has shown that there is little mater-
rial difference between the average incomes of cultivators of land, owned  
and unowned, and that of agricultural labourers, although there is considerable 
difference between the income of rent receivers and that of
the other agricultural classes. With the taking over of the zamindaris
by the State, the disparity of average incomes between the different 
sections of the agricultural population will have largely disappeared. <p>
 
     Although I have estimated the agricultural income at Rs. 271 crores 
(on the basis of 100 per cent sown area), the whole of it is not consumable
income. A portion of it, usually reckoned at 10 per cent, is to be set
apart for seeds and wastage. There are also taxes to be paid such 
land revenue, which amounted to Rs. 143.8 lakhs in 1948-49; local cess <p>

<b>++Page 43 AGRICULTURAL INCOME AND ITS DISTRIBUTION IN BIHAR (1953) </b><p>
 
which amounted to Rs. 103.5 lakhs (excluding cess on mines, quarries, 
forests and railways) in 1948-49; chowkidari tax, which amounted to 
about Rs. 35 lakhs in 1948; agricultural income tax, which amounted 
to Rs. 32 lakhs in 1948-49 and irrigation charges for Government canals 
amounting to Rs. 38.4 lakhs in 1948-49. Thus from Rs. 271 crores, we 
have to deduct at least Rs. 30.5 crores, leaving a disposable income of 
Rs. 240.4 crores. Even this does not allow for depreciation of agricul 
tural implements, maintenance of cattle and interest charges on money 
borrowed for financing agricultural operations. It is of interest to note 
that according to the Eastern Economist, the estimated net value of 
agricultural output in what now constitutes the Indian Union was about 
Rs. 3,050 crores in 1946-47. Thus Bihar's share in the total net value of 
the agricultural output of the Indian Union amounted to 7 to 8 per cent.<p>
