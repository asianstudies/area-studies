<h2>Preface</h2>
     In the past historians of the British period in India have
emphasized both the British and the political-military aspects.
For the early nineteenth century, considerable literature exists
concerning the Presidencies, British policies of expansion, and
the outstanding Governor Generals. Few historians have
extensively examined the social and economic developments in the
rest of India between the Wellesley and Lord Hastings
administrations. This paper, in part, hopes to fill this gap. In
addition, it provides a study of an area immediately prior to
European control.<p>
     This study began in fulfillment of one of the requirements
for the Indian Studies M.A. In spite of subsequent expansion and
revision, I am disappointed not to have discovered more material
about the social structure of the Pindaris, their economic
effects upon India, and the complex social situation in central
India. I believe I have examined most sources readily available
in the United States on the Pindaris, especially at the
University of Wisconsin libraries, but also the Chicago, New York
City, and the Minnesota Ames libraries. Additional material,
undoubtedly available in England and India, would contribute to a
better-documented examination.<p>

<center><h2><a name="rise">I. The Rise of the Pindaris</a></h2></center>

     European expansion overseas formidably began in the
sixteenth century. During the next four centuries this process
took many shapes and forms. Europeans discovered, conquered,
settled, and ruled in a large portion of the world. Local
conditions and circumstances often significantly influenced the
pace and the nature of European involvement. The establishment of
British rule and paramountcy in India provides one such example.
More specifically, the activities and existence of the Pindaris
directly affected the establishment and the pace of British rule
in India during the first two decades of the nineteenth century,
as had conditions within the Maratha Confederacy, the Mughal
empire, and other Indian states during the previous two
centuries. <p>
     The Pindaris are one of the most controversial groups, among
the many, which the British conquered during their rise to
paramountcy over India. In addition, Pindari ruthlessness and
atrocities rank along with <b><i>sati,</i></b> infanticide, and human sacrifice
in the mind of British writers of the time. According to them,
the advent of British civilization, peace, and prosperity meant
such contradictory practices could no longer exist. Yet it took
the right moment, circumstances, and man before the British
successfully suppressed the Pindaris. <p>
     Writing about the Pindaris, the Maratha historian, G. S.
Sardesai, states , <p>

<h5>++ Page 2  </h5>
     
 <blockquote>    Their true history has perhaps not yet been 
     written. The profuse British accounts suffer 
     from a natural bias created by the last years 
     of their activities perpetuating the impression 
     that the Pindaris were the enemies of society 
     and such loathsome pests as deserved to be 
     exterminated. <a href="#fn01">[1]</a> </blockquote>

This paper in no way proposes to write the definitive history of
the Pindaris. Not only are British accounts distorted by their
prejudice, but the earlier history of the Pindaris is obscure.
They left no written record of their own activities. Historians,
such as S. N. Sen and G. S. Sardesai, have examined the scanty
primary sources. Their research, however, has resulted in no
further astounding revelations. Because of the absence of
reliable sources and unless new ones are discovered, a complete
and comprehensive history of the Pindaris is not presently
possible. <p>
     Because of this speculative nature of early Pindari history,
this paper concentrates attention on the latest and
better-documented phase, from 1800 onward. Among the several aims
of this essay is the examination of the internal history of the
Pindaris, in particular, their origin and early history, their
growth in numbers, land, and wealth, the development of an
independent leadership, their social and military structure,
incursions into British territory, and their relations with the
Maratha powers. The second area of concern is British policy and
opinion toward the Pindaris during this same period. Thirdly, the
paper shows how the operations against the Pindaris were
intimately connected to the growth of British paramountcy ln
India.<p>

<h5>++ Page 3</h5>
  
     The emphasis throughout the paper is on the Pindaris
themselves. It is necessary to examine their place ln Indian and
British history, besides the military operations against them, in
order to provide an overall and continuous perspective. But this
is not an essay on Lord Hastings and his times, the Maratha
states, nor the military history of the destruction of the
Pindari system. Hence, secondary sources provide most of the
material for the description of these aspects.<p>
     In view of the sources available in the United States, and
given the political system in India during the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries, almost all of the sources are British
and in English. Contemporary public and official opinion created
a "black legend" about the Pindaris. This paper does not wish to
establish a "white legend." Rather, it endeavors to avoid both
extremes. It proposes to examine the events, causes and
circumstances which lie beneath the often-repeated, emotional
events in the writings of the British imperialists or ardent
Indian nationalists. <p>
     The Pindaris originated during the late nineteenth century
and developed into a group serving as auxiliaries to Indian
armies. Unfortunately, their origin and early history is obscure.
Only some tentative propositions are possible from the early
references. Even the meaning of the term "Pindari" is
controversial. <p>
     An exact etymology of the word Pindari does not exist; not
because no one has attempted to discover an origin, but<p>

<h5>++ Page 4</h5>

because writers have suggested so many different etymologies.
Many of these may be partially true, but no single one may claim
complete authenticity. <a href="#fn02">[2]</a>  The most probable etymology suggests that
the term originates from <i><b>pinda</b></i>, the intoxicating liquor which
Pindaris often drank. Most Pindaris felt this was the origin of
their name. <a href="#fn03">[3]</a>   Two other possible origins are the Hindi and Marathi
terms, <i><b>pendha hare</b></i> and <i><b>pind parna</b></i>. The first, "one who takes a
bundle of straw," refers to the function Pindaris sometimes
performed for armies as collectors of forage for horses. The
second, "to follow closely or to the death," alludes to the
Pindaris as stragglers attached to an army. The terms <i><b>Pandhar</b></i> and
<i><b>Bidaris</b></i> are concerned with two geographical regions with which
the Pindaris may have been connected. The Pandhar theory has
little to support it as this region on the Nerbudda River became
the area where Pindaris held land long after they were known as
Pindaris. <a href="#fn04">[4]</a>  Before this they were associated with another region
in the Deccan, Bidar. It is possible that their name is a
corruption of Bidari, meaning those from Bidar. One possible
transformation would be from Bidari through Bindari to Pindari.
This is the region in which writers first mentioned the Pindaris.<p>
     These several etymologies provide a basic definition for the
Pindaris. They were a group of loosely organized horsemen or
cavalry, attached to an army for the purpose of plundering and
harassing the enemy's lands and camps. They originated in an area
in the Deccan around Bidar and eventually settled in a region
once known as Pandhar. During the<p>

<h5>++ Page 5</h5>

last period of their existence they gradually detached themselves
from any army. They then plundered for themselves in any region
irrespective of whether it was enemy territory.<p> 
     In the context of this basic definition, groups of this
nature were not new in Indian politics and warfare. Two
well-known treatises on ancient and medieval Indian policy
mention that a king should employ robbers and thieves as part of
his strategy against the enemy. <a href="#fn05">[5]</a>  Though these are statements of
what a king should do, they probably represent in some form the
actual situation. For this reason, many rulers may have employed
similar groups to accomplish their purposes. <p>
     After the Mughals began ruling in India, it is therefore not
surprising that they eventually adopted military units similar to
the groups sometimes hired by their predecessors. In the Deccan,
such a contingent formed part of their army. This least-known
period of Pindari history can be distinguished as the Muslim
Period in comparison to the two later periods. During the
succeeding Maratha Period, Maratha chiefs added the Pindaris to
their armies. Finally, in the Independent Period, the Pindaris
gradually broke with this Maratha control and plundered for
themselves. <p>
     The Muslim historian, Firishta, makes the first clear
reference to the name Pindari in 1689 during Aurangzeb's campaign
in the Deccan. <a href="#fn06">[6]</a>   At the same time another source mentions that
the Bidaris or Pindaris marched with the Mughal armies as
privileged and recognized thieves. The Italian adventurer.
Niccolao Manucci, states that they are 

<h5>++ Page 6</h5>

"the first to invade the enemy's territory, where they plunder
everything they find." <a href="#fn07">[7]</a> <p>
     No substantial additional material is available besides this
brief account of the Muslim Period. During the succeeding Maratha
Period, source material is equally scanty. The Marathas did not
employ Pindaris until after Sivaji's time, but probably during
the rule of Balaji Rao, the Marathas hired them under the Pindari
leader, Gardi Khan. <a href="#fn08">[8]</a>   Sources provide no reason for this change of
sides. Perhaps the Pindaris revolted against the Muslim effort to
control them more strictly, or they may have felt that
opportunities for plunder were more frequent and lucrative under
the Marathas. <a href="#fn09">[9]</a>   Their position as a regular part of the Maratha
army dates from this time. The Poona court permitted each chief,
such as Holkar and Sindhia, to keep a prescribed number of
Pindaris in their camps. Within the Maratha military system the
Pindaris formed the fourth type of cavalry. The other three
consisted of the <i><b>Khasgi paga</b></i> or a small elite guard, the
<i><b>Silhedars</b></i> or the paid high-caliber horsemen, and the <i><b>Ekas</b></i> or
<i><b>Ekandas</b></i> or volunteer cavalry. <a href="#fn10">[10] </a> <p>
     Under this system, which prevailed during the eighteenth
century, the Pindaris provided a source of income for the Maratha
chiefs. The chiefs protected the Pindaris and allowed them to
plunder areas through which the Maratha armies marched. The
Pindaris, in return, paid the chiefs a tax called <i><b>palpatti.</b></i> <a href="#fn11">[11] </a>
Evidently the Marathas found them useful because of their skill
as marauders who owned their own horses, because of their speed
and endurance for long <p>

<h5>++ Page 7</h5>

marches, and their ability to take action on their own
initiative. From a Maratha viewpoint it was reassuring that the
Pindaris never became sentimentally attached to any one powerful
leader. <a href="#fn12">]12]</a> <p>
     This arrangement with the Pindaris benefited the Marathas as
long as they maintained the army as an organized unit serving the
purposes of the Maratha state, and as long as strong chiefs
tightly controlled the Pindaris and their army. But during the
late eighteenth century Maratha leadership deteriorated, leaving
less able men to rule. Under them the semblance of a confederacy
slowly decayed with each chief trying to retain control in his
own area and to promote himself to the leadership of the
confederacy.<p> 
     Under these circumstances, the Pindaris grew ln numbers and
wealth during the turn of the century. Their character changed
considerably from auxiliaries to an army to a semiindependent
cavalry under their own leaders with only nominal alliance to
certain Maratha chiefs. This change characterizes the
transitional phase in Pindari history between the Maratha Period
and the Independent Period.<p>

<center><h2><a name="inde">II. The Independent Period </a></h2></center>

        As with any periodization, the Independent Period of the
Pindaris is somewhat arbitrary, but for the purposes of this
paper lt was from about 1800 to 1818. During these two decades
the Pindaris and their leaders plundered at will, while Maratha
leadership rarely exercised even nominal control over them. For
this reason the Period may be designated as the Independent
Period. But the Pindaris were neither strong enough nor did they
wish to declare their formal independence. Since they lived ln an
area controlled by the Marathas, they never formally repudiated
their nebulous overlordship. <p>
     Three conditions account for the growth of the Pindaris into
an independent and formidable force by 1815. They are their
increase in numbers and wealth as well as the rise of a new and
independent leadership. <p>
     The increase of the Pindaris in numbers defies any exact
calculation because census reports for this period are
non-existent. British observers estimated the numbers of the
Pindaris occasionally from sight, but mostly by adding informants' 
reports about the various <i><b>durrahs</b></i> (groups of Pindaris under a
recognized Pindari leader). In 1810 Captain Sydenham, the
Resident at the Berar court, complained that he could not give
anything "in the shape of a regular or accurate account of the
Pindaris" because of the "imperfect materials" he possessed.<a href="#fn13">[13] </a>
Furthermore, there was no recognized definition of Pindaris. Some
observers tended  

<h5>++ Page 9</h5>

to include certain durrahs which others excluded. Some reports
were selective, while others included all irregular cavalry in
the area. Consequently, most estimates are inaccurate or
contradictory. To add to the confusion, the Pindaris seemed to
rise and fall according to the success or failure of their
plundering raids.<a href="#fn14">[14] </a> Often the numbers of Pindaris for a single
raid or <i><b>luhbur</b></i> increased to twice its original size because the
people, whom the Pindaris plundered, Joined the luhbur out of
desperation at the loss of all their possessions. Ruffians and
vagabonds also Joined the luhbur as it passed through their
locality. <a href="#fn15">[15] </a><p>
     Thus, three accounts of the Pindaris in 1812 estimated the
numbers of the Pindaris as 22,000, 26,000, and 44,000. <a href="#fn16">[l6]</a>  A
compilation of the various estimates illustrates this confusion
further: <pre> 
     YEAR      OBSERVER       NUMBERS
     1800      Jenkins         2,250 
     1800      Sydenham       10,000 
     1804      Malcolm        10,000 
     1809      Jenkins        24,550 
     1809      Sydenham       25,000 
     1810      Sydenham       20,000 
     1811      Jenklns    not less than 4-5,000 
     1811      Fitzclarence   26,000 
     1811      Prinsep        25,000
     1814      Sydenham    20-25,000 
     1814      Prinsep        20,000 
     1800-1818 Malcolm     20-30,000 <a href="#fn17">[17]</a> </pre>

In conclusion, the numbers of Pindaris probably increased during
the Independent Period as much as from 10,000 in 1800 to about
25-30,000 in 1814. An estimate, however, of the annual increase
is virtually impossible. <p>
     Equally difficult to measure with any satisfactory accuracy
is the increase ln land and wealth of the Pindaris<p>

<h5>++ Page 10 </h5> 

during this period. The three accounts above estimate the annual
revenue from Pindari lands at 834,000, 1,200,000, and 1,957,000
rupees. <a href="#fn18">[18]  </a>This compares with the only figure before 1800 of
50,000 rupees annual revenue. <a href="#fn19">[19 ] </a>Various reports on Pindari land
indicated that Pindari leaders received grants of land during
this period from the Maratha chiefs (mainly Sindhia and Holkar)
for their services. They retained these territories in their
possession and tried to extend them. Most of these lands, located
Just north of the Nerbudda River in central India, provided the
Pindaris with a steady income, a place for their families to
live, and a center from which to plunder. During the Maratha
Period, Baji Rao I and later the Bhonsla Raja gave the Pindaris
grants of land. These lands, however, soon passed from their
possession. Moreover, they were not as extensive or as lucrative
as their land during the Independent Period. <a href="#fn20">[20] </a><p>
     In addition to the revenue from land, the Pindari leaders
occasionally received cash allotments in lieu of abstaining from
plundering, but there are no estimates of this source of income. 
<a href="#fn21">[21] </a> As the Pindaris became stronger, they sometimes intimidated a
central Indian chief or prince with the threat of
pay-or-we-plunder. Reports of the 1811 Dusshera meeting confirm
this. Karim Khan tried to convince another Pindari leader, Chitu,
to plunder the neighboring Bhonsla territory. Chitu refused to
Join him. One can reasonably speculate that Chitu received a
large bribe from the Bhonsla ruler. Consequently, the plundering
never occurred. <a href="#fn22">[22] </a><p>

<h5>++ Page 11</h5>

     Plunder provided the largest, though most transient, source
of Pindari income and wealth. After returning from an expedition,
the Pindaris immediately spent their plunder for the payment of
debts and on amusements and carousing. <a href="#fn23">[23] </a> 
One may conjecture about
the effect this plundering had on the Indian economy. If the
Pindaris had plundered more extensively and for a longer period,
they might have transformed the Indian economy instead of aiding
to destroy it. Most of-the wealth they plundered consisted of
precious jewelry or hard currency. Often extracting much of this
hoarded wealth by means of torture, they began the circulation of
otherwise stagnant capital. (This, of course, could also cause
inflation.) Their operations, however, were not that extensive.
In fact, the hoarded wealth merely changed hands from the robbed
to the merchant in central India who again probably hoarded it. <p>
     The emergence of a new kind of leadership characterizes the
third aspect of the Pindaris' growth to independence. On one
hand, Pindari leadership grew more independent, not because they
acquired more capable leaders, but because they filled a power
vacuum in central India. During this time) the Maratha leaders
were weak. The Peshwa at Poona had been defeated by the British
as had Sindhia. Holkar had maintained his independence, but his
insanity in 1808 meant a continual struggle for power in his
court and a deterioration of control over his relationships with
other power groups. <a href="#fn24">[24] </a><p>
     On the other hand, the Pindaris gradually transferred <p>

<h5>++ Page 12</h5>

their primary devotion and obedience from the Maratha chiefs to
their own durrah leaders. During the first decade of the
nineteenth century, it was fairly easy to designate the different
Pindari groups as belonging to either the Holkar or Sindhia
Shahi, meaning royal possession or royal. In subsequent years the
bond between these chiefs. and the Pindaris weakened.
Furthermore, most of the active and larger groups belonged
nominally to the Sindhia <i><b>Shahi.</b></i> Hence, this title became less
meaningful and the designation, durrah, more useful. <a href="#fn25">[25] </a><p>
     A closer examination of the history of the different Pindari
leaders will clarify this transition. Among these leaders were
Ghazi-u-Din, Gardi Khan, Shah Baz Khan, Hiro, Barun, Karim Khan,
Chitu, Wasil Muhammad, and Numdar Khan. <p>
     Ghats-u-Din was the first Pindari hired by the Marathas. He
fought under the Peshwa, BaJi Rao I, in Hindustan. When Holkar
formally recognized his military achievements, he and one of his
sons, Gardi Khan, attached-themselves to his court. This group of
Pindaris, even after their hereditary leadership became extinct,
remained under Holkar down through the Independent Period. Before
his insanity, Jaswant Rao Holkar firmly controlled the Pindaris.
It is even possible that he may have planned to destroy them.
After Tulsi Bai gained control, she gave them titles and land. In
this way the Pindaris gained positions of greater strength. <a href="#fn26">[26]</a> 
Yet, during the Independent Period, this group of Pindaris mainly
under Kandir Bakhsh's leadership was less active compared to
other Pindari groups. <p>

<h5>++ Page 13  </h5>

     Shah Baz Khan organized the second main division of the
Pindaris, generally connected with Sindhia. He died in a
Hindustan campaign in Sindhia's service, but his group continued
their association with the house of Sindhia. During the last
decade of the eighteenth century, Shah Baz Khan's sons, Hlro and
Barun, offered their services to the Nawab of Bhopal. When he
hesitated to accept this offer, the Bhonsla family at Nagpur
hired them. The Pindaris' first assignment, which they executed
with enthusiasm and success, was to plunder Bhopal. Jealous of
the wealthy loot accumulated in this assignment and siding with
Hiro in a dispute, the Bhonsla Raja plundered the Pindari camp
and took Barun prisoner. <a href="#fn27">[27] </a>Hiro fled to Sindhia uncertain of his
own safety. Both leaders died shortly after in 1800. , <p>
     Similar to the Holkar Shahi, hereditary leadership of a
durrah became less significant in the Sindhia Shahi after 1800.
Two new leaders, Kc rim Khan and Chitu, rose to prominence at
this time. During the Independent Period they remained the
dominant leaders of the Pindaris. <p>
     Karim Khan was briefly the wealthiest and most powerful
Pindari leader. As a young soldier, he successively served under
the Peshwa, Sindhia, and Barun. When the Bhonsla Raja took Barun
prisoner, he fled and served under Sindhia. In the wars against
Hyderabad, especially at Kharda (1795), he amassed a fortune in
plunder. To safeguard this newly acquired wealth, he established
himself at Shujaulpur in central India. There he attracted a
large Pindari following. Later, ln 1804, Sindhia confirmed his
possession of <p>

<h5>++ Page 14</h5>

this land which was worth 15 lakhs of rupees annual revenue.
Seeking to set himself up as a prince, Karim Khan tried to expand
unsuccessfully into Bhopal. In 1806, Sindhia, fearing Karim
Khan's expansionist ambitions and growing power, enticed him to
his camp and took him prisoner. <a href="#fn28">[28] </a> Karim Khan's mother fled with
her son's wealth to the prince of Kotah, Zalim Singh. During the
next five years, Karim Khan remained a prisoner of Sindhia while
other Pindari leaders continued to expand their power. <p>
     Chitu, the other outstanding Pindari leader of the
Independent Period, was born a Jat near Delhi. Dobble Khan, whose
sons led Barun' B durrah, bought Chitu as a slave and then
adopted him as his son. Eventually Chitu acquired the leadership
of Barun's group. <a href="#fn29">[29] </a>Like Karim Khan, Sindhia gave Chitu a title
and lands in 1804, but also took him prisoner in 1807. <a href="#fn30">[30]</a> <p>
     On payment of a large ransom, Sindhia released both leaders
in 1811. During the Dusshera festival they planned to join forces
against Sindhia and the Bhonsla. As has already been mentioned,
the Bhonsla bought off Chitu with grants of land. Chitu then
joined Sindhia by helping his officer, Jago Bapu, defeat Karim
Khan. <a href="#fn31">[31] </a> Karim Khan fled to Zalim Singh for protection. At the
same time Sindhia threatened Zalim Singh with reprisals if he
gave Karim Khan asylum. Karim Khan finally turned to Amir Khan
and Holkar for help. They negotiated a settlement, by which Karim
Khan remained under their confinement until 1816. When he
obtained his freedom in that year. he again attempted a union<p>

<h5>++ Page 15</h5>

with Chitu for a common defense against the British. Quarrels
between the two prevented such an alliance. <p>
     Numdar Khan and Wasil Muhammad were among the leaders of
smaller durrahs during this Period. As Karim Khan's nephew,
Numdar Khan occasionally plundered Sindhia's territory to avenge
his uncle's subjugation. <a href="#fn32">[32] </a> His durrah numbered only about 2,000
men compared to the 10,000 of Karim Khan's. Wasil Muhammad, who
was a son of Hiro, generally remained loyal to Sindhia with a
durrah of 5,000 men. <a href="#fn33">[33] </a><p>
     Pindari leadership thus achieved its greatest power and
wealth in 1804-06 when Sindhia gave titles and recognized or gave
lands to the Pindari leaders. The fact that Sindhia imprisoned
both Karim Khan and Chitu at one time indicates that he feared
they were becoming too strong and independent. The main weakness
of Pindari leadership was demonstrated in the Dussheras of 1811
and 1817 when they could not and did not unite. Hence, the
Maratha powers were able to bribe them or play one oft against
the other.

<center><h2><a name="soci">III. Pindari Society</a></h2></center>

     No study of the Pindaris would be complete without some
consideration of the nature and structure of Pindari society.
Though contemporary interest in such issues as the numbers,
wealth and leaders of the Pindaris tended to obscure the
character of Pindari society, it nevertheless existed distinct
from other groups. The Pindaris were essentially an association
of cavalrymen, banded together for the purpose of plundering. Not
simply organized robbers, nor military men, they combined both
aspects and selected those methods which most effectively served
their purposes. An examination of their military structure,
social composition, some religious practices, a comparison with
other quasi-mllltary groups, and a review of their annual life
differentiate the particular features of Pindari society.<p>
     Sources relating to the Pindaris reveal no formal military
structure. Four hierarchical units, however, are evident. At the
top the Pindaris professed loyalty to either Sindhia or Holkar.
Every group identified itself as belonging to the Sindhia or
Holkar Shahi. Below this broad dual division, the many Pindari
leaders controlled their members in durrahs or camps. These
durrahs subsequently consisted of several "parties," the smallest
definable unit. The size of these parties varied considerably
depending on the skills and reputation of the party leader.<p>
     Cutting across durrah distinctions, the luhbur or raiding
expedition usually consisted of parties from several<p>

<h5>++ Page 17</h5>

durrahs. Of the 1O,OOO Pindaris participating in the 1816 luhbur
on the Madras Presidency, 7,000 belonged to Chitu's durrah, 1,000
to Karim Khan's, 500 to Dost Muhammad's, and 1,500 to the Holkar
Shahi. <a href="#fn34">[34]</a> <p>
     A Pindari belonged to a party by his own choice. He could
transfer his loyalty and obedience to another leader for several
reasons. He might have feuds with other party members, or another
leader might attract him by offering more beneficial rewards and
a better position. Various factors, however, contributed to a
[air amount of stability.  Several generations of service and
loyalty under one leader traditionally bound a Pindari's family
to one particular party. A Pindari might also have a recognized
rank of some status within a party. Accounts of the quarrels at
the annual Dusshera meetings and the wide variation of the size
of the durrahs, however, indicate that a leader had to uee his
arbitrational skills, and provide a minimal amount of financial
and physical security to maintain his group or attract new
members.<p>
     Such a heterogeneous group, united primarily by a de-sire to
plunder, attests to the multiplicity of their origins. The
majority, "hard core" Pindaris grew into their occupation by
birth. Their fathers, and perhaps even great grandfathers, as in
the case of Dost Muhammad, were Pindaris.  Reports of the
kidnapping of women and children on luhburs, or the buying of
child slaves like Chitu indicate only slight variations from this
regular pattern. <a href="#fn35">[35]</a>   The wealth obtained from plunder and the
freedom of Pindari life also attracted<p>

<h5>++ Page 18</h5>

additional members such as Karim Khan. The transition of
occupation from an irregularly paid cavalry man under Sindhia to
a Sindhia Shahi Pindari who acquired his own subsistence through
plundering was fairly easy. Thus, many Pindaris were originally
Muslim or Maratha cavalrymen who were disbanded or found Pindari
life better than formal military service. <a href="#fn36">[36]</a> Sydenham provided
other origins. He reported that those who wished to escape
debtors, who were expelled from their communities because of
crimes or were unemployed for various reasons also joined the
Pindaris.  The only requirements were the possession of a horse
and a spear. <a href="#fn37">[37]</a> <p>
     Pindari society was, therefore, composed of many classes and
castes, who came from several areas. <a href="#fn38">[38]</a>  It is impossible to
distinguish any proportion of specific groups. <a href="#fn39">[39]</a>  Certainly, the
Pindaris tolerated and permitted the existence of a variety of
customs and traditions which groups continued to practice. Even
the scanty knowledge about certain religious practices confirms
this. Most Pindaris professed to be Muslims, but some could not
even repeat the karma or Muslim creed nor knew the name of the
prophet . <a href="#fn40">[40]</a>  They worshipped 
several gods and goddesses. Among the
most widely revered was a deified warrior, Ramasah Pir, who had
been killed in battle. Muslims called him Zair Pir while Hindus
worshipped him as Goga Pir. Women especially sought this god's
favor when their husbands set out on a luhbur. At such times they
offered small clay or stone icons of horses to his shrine. In
addition, for good luck, Pindaris often wore<p>

<h5>++ Page 19</h5>

coins around their necks stamped with the image of Ramasah Pir on
horseback. <a href="#fn41">[41]</a>  By these religious practices the Pindaris permitted
the accommodation of two traditions under one god. The
auspiciousness of the horse as icons or on coins also affirms the
centrality of the horse to the Pindari's livelihood.<p>
     A valuable method off further determining the peculiar
nature of Pindari society is to compare them with two other
groups in central India, the Pathans and the Marathas. The
Pathans were militarily very similar to the Pindaris . Amir Khan
led this group who were also in central India at this time.
British writers sometimes tended to confuse the Pathans as part
of the Pindaris. Both concentrated their activities in
approximately the same area of India, both served Maratha chiefs,
and both were primarily horsemen. <a href="#fn42">[42]</a>  But some essential
differences existed. The Pathan leaders regularly paid their
troops for their services, while the Pindaris never received pay.
Rather, they paid their leaders part of their plunder in return
for protection and the privilege to plunder. Only rarely Maratha
chief s provided the Pindaris with a compensation pay to support
themselves while they suspended their plundering activities. <a href="#fn43">[43]</a> 
Secondly, the Pathans employed some infantry and: artillery
though cavalry predominated. The Pindaris, on the other hand,
consisted exclusively of horsemen. Only a very small number of
artillery and infantry protected their lands and leaders in
central India. <a href="#fn44">[44]</a> The Pathan cavalry was also more disciplined and
regular than the Pindaris. <a href="#fn45">[45]</a> While the Pathans<p>

<h5>++ Page 20</h5>

extended their activity from central India toward the north->west
in Rajputana, the Pindaris plundered east and mostly south of
central India. <a href="#fn46">[46]</a>  Finally, the Pathans consisted of more
homogeneous groups (being mostly Pathans) than the Pindaris. The
main differences were, therefore, organizational rather than
functional. Writers, who regarded the functional aspect, i.e.
their destructive and plundering activities under Maratha chiefs
as more significant, tended to view these two groups as one.<p>
     The Pindaris also differed from another group in central
India, the Marathas. The Pindaris nominally served under the
Maratha chiefs and existed within the territories which the
Marathas controlled. A more essential difference, however, was
the Marathas' "national)' feeling based on their territory,
Maharasthra, and their religion, Hinduism. They had an
established form of government and administration. <a href="#fn47">[47]</a> The
Pindaris, on the other hand, had no historical or emotional
attachment to any one area as their own. Most of them professed
to be Muslim, but the undogmatic nature of their religion and the
tolerance of other religions and practices among them provided no
basis for a "national" feeling. Their peculiar customs and life
discouraged a permanently settled life under a responsible
government of their own. In order to plunder, they could respect
few laws of established governments. They stole, killed, burned,
tortured, and destroyed life and property. They recognized only
the rules and commands of their durrah leaders. These they
followed in order to plunder and to protect themselves<p>

<h5>++ Page 21</h5>

from other groups. The Pindaris, therefore, only superficially
resembled the Marathas. Both raided territories on horseback, the
Marathas during the eighteenth century to levy <i><b>chauth </b></i>and
<i><b>sardeshmukhi</b></i>, and the Pindaris for plunder.  Any emphasis of the
difference between the Marathas and Pindaris is, therefore,
functional rather than organizational. The Marathas held a
position of power as a government which they wished to maintain.
The Pindaris only wished to plunder.<p>
     The Pindari's cycle of life during a year most thoroughly
reveals his character. His life centered around two seasons, the
rainy season and the raiding season. During the rains, he led an
"inactive" life in central India.  After the rains, he joined the
plundering luhburs.<p>
     Throughout the monsoon season (June-October) a Pindari lived
in the area which a protecting Maratha chief or a Pindari leader
provided for him. During the Independent Period this territory
consisted of the land north of the Nerbudda River in Malwa and
central India. Chitu held land in the mountainous area around
Sutwas and Nimwar just north of the Nerbudda. Karim Khan held the
largest amount of land in the Pan] Mahals, and Wasil Muhammad
held land around Karewye and Udaipur. <a href="#fn48">[48]</a> These lands were given by
and held under Sindhia, while Holkar's government also provided
lands for his Pindaris west of Bhopal . <a href="#fn49">[49]</a> <p>
     The moist ground and the swollen rivers prevented the
Pindaris from plundering during this season. They supported
themselves mostly by loans from merchants or cash payments<p>

<h5><a name="pg22">++ Page 22</a></h5>

from Maratha chiefs and the land revenue from durrah leaders. 50
Other than this the activities of the Pindaris are least known
during this part of the year. Contemporary writers were not
concerned with the peaceful and "inactive" Pindaris.<p>
     Several remarks, however, indirectly demonstrate that the
Pindaris possibly worked at other occupations during this season.
After the 1817-19 war the population of central India suddenly
and completely absorbed about 20,000 Pindaris. <a href="#fn51">[51]</a>  John Malcolm,
the agent responsible for establishing British control and
administration in the area, could only suggest a few places to
which these Pindaris had disappeared. A few leaders were
pensioners of the British in Bhopal and Nimwar. Between five and
six hundred sold toddy at Mhow. Others made thatched roofs and
transported building materials and grain. The majority had been
"amalgamated with the lowest of labouring classes, whence many
had originally sprung." <a href="#fn52">[52]</a>  It is, therefore, concluded that
previous to British control many Pindaris followed these
occupations, such as toddy selling and transporting goods, during
much of the year. This income supplemented their wealth derived
from plunder and supported them during the years or months they
did not plunder. <a href="#fn53">[53]</a>  Only such a proposition can account for the
ease by which the Pindaris were absorbed after the war.<p>
     The most widely known and feared Pindari was the plundering
Pindari. After the rains ended the Pindaris gathered at a point
north of the Nerbudda, usually Nimwar, at the<p>

<h5>++ Page 23</h5>

time of Dusshera (the end of October to the first of November).
The significance of this festival for the Pindaris is uncertain.
Perhaps it was a continuation of the tradition established by the
Marathas, who had always assembled during Dusshera before
dispersing to collect chauth. On the other hand, the Pindaris may
have associated some religious meaning to the homage paid to the
gods or goddesses worshipped at this festival.  It may simply
have been a convenient, well-known date for meeting after the
rains. What-ever the reasons, the Pindaris and their leaders
gathered and planned their activities for the coming year.
Leaders formed alliances, settled arguments, and decided what
areas to plunder. The Pindaris repaired their equipment and
weapons and bought and prepared their horses in anticipation for
the expeditions.<p>
     The key organization for plundering was the luhbur or
raiding expedition. A luhbeerea led the expedition.  Pindaris chose
him on the basis of his familiarity with the country to be
plundered. Durrah leaders themselves remained in their camps in
central India and seldom led a luhbur.  They advised the parties
within their durrahs of areas to plunder. Their messengers kept
them informed of the progress and success of these parties. <a href="#fn54">[54]</a> <p>
     During the weeks or months after Dusshera, the luhbeerea
formulated his plans and sent envoys to inform the Pindari
parties of them. Then, on a selected day, he rode out of camp
unannounced and sounded his horn. Those who chose to follow him
dropped everything and rode oft after him. <a href="#fn55">[55]</a> <p>

<h5>++ Page 24</h5>

     The luhbur generally consisted of 1,000 to 4,000 Pindaris
but other persons often Joined the initial group along the way.
 <a href="#fn56">[56]</a> It was a mixed group composed of several parties with their
own subordinate leaders. <a href="#fn57">[57]</a> About half of the luhbur was
well-mounted, while the rest rode tattos, galloways, or ponies.
The Pindaris usually bought these horses from the Marathas. They
took great care in feeding and handling them, though they did not
practice horsemen-ship. <a href="#fn58">[58]</a> The most common weapons were spears,
eight to twelve feet long, and swords. One in every twenty was
armed with a matchlock and some leaders carried pistols . <a href="#fn59">[59]</a> <p>
     As the luhbur headed directly for its destination, it often
used lens frequented roads. The group traveled ten to twenty
coss, or twenty to forty miles a day. It could traverse as much
as sixty miles a day. <a href="#fn60">[60]</a>  Usually, it stopped twice during the day,
once from noon to four in the afternoon, and again from midnight
to dawn. <a href="#fn61">[61]</a> The luhbeerea called a halt by planting his standard
in the ground. The whole luhbur rode past him, leaving him in the
rear. In this way he could arouse everyone by riding through
camp, when he wished to proceed.<p>
     The Pindaris were well-known for their mobility and
endurance. They traveled light, carrying no tents or baggage.
They trained both their horses and themselves for long and swift
marches. <a href="#fn62">[62]</a> When they slept on their paddles, they tied the rein
of their horses around their wrist, ready for any surprise
attack. For subsistence along the way, they ate the little food
they brought with them. When that<p>

<h5>++ Page 25</h5>

was exhausted, they lived off the land, demanding food from the
local inhabitants and collecting forage for the horses.<p>
     Local inhabitants, travelers, fakirs, and sadhus provided
the Pindaris with intelligence about wealthy places to plunder,
the movement of troops, and other Pindari parties. <a href="#fn63">[63]</a> They had no
other intelligence system of their own and, thus, employed no
spies in areas they plundered.  Their advanced guard acted as a
scouting party but did not seek places to plunder. <a href="#fn64">[64]</a> <p>
     When the luhbur reached their destination, they separated
into parties of 50 to 100 to plunder the villages in the area.
This final destination might be as much as 400 miles from their
base camp. <a href="#fn64">[65]</a> Riding into a village by surprise, they first tried
to locate the wealthiest residences and then looted the village
of its valuable articles.  In order to find any hidden wealth they
tortured the villagers. They used several methods, besides
beating. Two common methods of torture were the "sack" and the
"boards."  For the first one, they filled a sack with hot coals,
ashes and spices, placed it over a person's head or nostrils, and
thumped him on the back to make him inhale. The victim either
revealed where his wealth was hidden or he died of burns and
suffocation. The "boards" derives its name from the two heavy
boards between which the Pindaris made a person lie on the
ground. Then two Pindaris stood and jumped on them, one on each
end, until the tortured person's rib cage collapsed or he told
the location of his money and jewels. British writers also
recorded other atrocities,<p>

<h5>++ Page 26</h5>

such as burning men, dividing children with swords in mid air,
and raping women. <a href="#fn66">[66]</a> <p>
     After plundering several villages during the day, the luhbur
collected for the night. Sometimes they burned villages and crops
to indicate their positions to other parties of the luhbur. <a href="#fn67">[67]</a> 
They forced the inhabitants to collect forage, carry heavy stolen
articles, bring and cook food, and spent the night with the "best
looking women" of the area. <a href="#fn68">[68 ]</a>   Sometimes they held the headman
overnight as ransom.  They would progressively send cut-off parts
of his body to the village and warned that the next would be his
heart it the villagers did not send more money soon. <a href="#fn69">[69]</a> <p>
     After several days of plundering in an area, the luhbur
returned to their base camps above the Nerbudda. If the amount of
plunder satisfied them, they remained there.Otherwise they headed
in another direction for more plunder.  Parties, within the luhbur,
could leave it at any time and plunder on their own. <a href="#fn70">[70 ]</a>   The pace
of the return march was usually, and naturally, faster to escape
pursuing troops.<p>
     Most of the plundered articles consisted of easily
transportable goods, such as silver and gold coins, jewelry and
rings. These the Pindaris carried on them. But sources also
mention stolen elephants, that local inhabitants carried heavy
articles for the Pindaris, and that sixty bullocks transported
the plunder from one town. <a href="#fn71">[71]</a> This indicates that while the
Pindaris took most of their plunder with them, they also employed
local people and other means of transportation to carry bulkier
goods.<p>

<h5>++ Page 27</h5>

     If the local inhabitants received news of an approaching
band of Pindaris, they usually fled to the hills and forests with
their valuable articles. <a href="#fn72">[72]</a> One contemporary Indian described the
times in these words:<p>
<blockquote>          Hindustan was at this time tormented by demons
          from the lowest hill. I cannot describe the
          horrors of those days: Ram Ram, Sitaram--may
          they never come again! The very name of
          Pindaree, or of Cheeto, their Chief, was ac-
          cursed. Merchants trembled when they heard it �
          young women wept;--no one felt safe. <a href="#fn73">[73]</a> </blockquote>
As late as 1890 one British writer discovered a village tower
from which the inhabitants of Bijapur district used to watch for
Pindaris. <a href="#fn74">[74]</a>  These reveal the nature of the reaction to the
Pindaris. The villagers feared and fled from Pindari luhburs.
Their name excited alarm over a wide area of India during this
time.<p>
     After returning to their camps from an expedition, the
Pindaris divided and sold their plunder. The valuable articles
attracted merchants, brokers, liquor sellers, and entertainers.
The Pindaris divided their plunder several ways, often depending
on the force of the demanding person.  Sometimes the durrah leader
received one-fourth of all the plunder, sometimes only the
valuable articles (such as elephants, and large wealthy objects)
and sometimes nothing.  The luhbur leader usually received some
compensation, in addition to all the disputed articles. The
Pindaris themselves, however, kept most of the plunder they had
taken. This they first sold to pa y off debts. The rest they
spent on entertainment, carousing and drinking. <a href="#fn75">[75]</a> On one occasion
the plunder taken from a luhbur amounted to so much that<p>

<h5>++ Page 28</h5>

merchants from Ujain had to come before the Pindaris could sell
all of it. <a href="#fn76">[76]</a>  After spending this plunder, the Pindaris either
planned their next expedition or stayed at their homes until the
next raiding season.<p>
     A Pindari's life, like Pindari society, had a variety of
aspects. During much of the year he and his family lived in the
towns and villages of central India along with the other
inhabitants. During this time he might supplement his income by
several "moonlighting" occupations. After the rains and Dusshera,
however, he "earned" his main income on luhburs. His life as a
plunderer was rough and carefree.  He relied completely on his
riding skill, his endurance, his horse, his weapons, his
alertness, and often his cruelty to protect him and provide his
income. Such a life was both exciting and precarious. British
indignation at the extension of luhburs into their territory and
their subsequent policies eventually terminated the existence of
this society.  <p>

<center><h2><a name="init">IV. Initial Clashes with the British</a></h2></center>

     The detailed description of a luhbur in the previous chapter
provides a background for the examination of Pindari raids into
British territory. These raids are significant for Pindari
history because they directly precipitated the British decision
to destroy the Pindaris. <p>
     British writers provided two main theories concerning the
extension of Pindari activities over a larger area. The first
suggests that since the Pindaris had completely exhausted the
area in central India which usually supported them, they were
forced to plunder elsewhere . <a href="#fn77">[77]</a>  The second implies that durrah
leaders, with the support of Maratha chiefs, supervised and
directed their parties to plunder British possessions. <a href="#fn78">[78]</a> Both
conjectures are difficult to assess. The prospect of plundering
in new, "virgin," and wealthy areas certainly might have
attracted the Pindaris. It is possible that the area previously
plundered was no longer worth plundering. Pindari parties also
followed the suggestions of their leaders, but the sources do not
indicate whither this was part of a conscious Maratha conspiracy
against the British. The natural presumption is that since
Pindari envoys often attended Maratha camps and since the
Marathas had fought and thought of the British as enemies, they
wanted to and did use the Pindaris to destroy the resources of
the enemy. <p>
     Writers also presume that before the Pindaris started
raiding British territory (1812), they annually plundered <p>

<h5>++ Page 30 </h5>

the territories of the Nizam, the Peshwa, and the Bhonsla. Yet
the sources reveal no details about this. Karim Khan had raided
the Nizam's territory when he served under Sindhia in 1794. <a href="#fn79">[79]</a>  He
had also served the Bhonsla against Bhopal. Later he tried to
extend his possessions of land into both these areas in 1804-5. <a href="#fn80">[80]</a> 
There is no record of specific raids into the Peshwa's
territories. Either the observers of Pindari activities felt
these raids were too insignificant or they never occurred. <p>
     The following account also illustrates British reaction to
the Pindaris. After recovering from the initial shock of the
Pindari audacity of invading British possessions, they devised a
plan of defense. When this proved only partially successful, the
British decided that open war presented the only means to destroy
the Pindari menace.<p>
     The first luhbur into British territory occurred in March
1812 on the frontier of Mirzapur. First reports indicated that a
party, belonging mostly to Dost Muhammad's durrah, was headed for
the territory of the RaJa of Nagpur. Along the way, however, they
met an expelled <i><b>zamindar </b></i>from Allahabad. <a href="#fn81">[81]</a>   He convinced them to
change the destination of their luhbur. The Mirzapur area was not
only prosperous, few troops were stationed there at the time. The
luhbur of about 3,000 entered the districts of Mirzapur through
the territory of the Raja of Rewah. They plundered five or six
villages, and threatened but did not enter the city of Mirzapur.
Hurriedly, the group crossed the Son River, passed through a
district of the Raja of Nagpur, and back to their <p>

<h5>++ Page 31 </h5>
                                                              
base. <a href="#fn82">[82]</a>   By the time reports reached the Government in Calcutta,
the Pindaris had left. In order to prevent a  recurrence of this,
the Government stationed troops to defend this frontier and
concluded a treaty with the Raja of Rewah. <a href="#fn83">[83]</a> The Pindaris never
raided this area again. <p>
     Such events revealed several significant observations. Both
a weakly-defended and prosperous area attracted Pindari luhburs.
When the Government stationed troops on the frontier, the
Pindaris did not risk another luhbur there. The Pindaris obtained
their intelligence from a variety of sources, in this case a
zamindar. Their raid was so swift that it was over before the
Government received news of what had happened. Mobility was the
Pindaris' best defense.<p> 
     The following winter (l812-1813) the second Pindari
incursion entered British territory in the west, around Surat.
Five thousand horsemen plundered four or five villages and the
frightened people fled to Surat for protection. Before the
Government sent any troops against the Pindaris, they had
returned to their base with a great loot. Reports indicated that
they contemplated another raid but never carried it out. <a href="#fn84">[84]</a> <p>
     The following two seasons the Pindaris made no attacks on
British territory. However, as a prelude to the worst devastation
of British possessions, they plundered the Nizam's territory in
October and November of 1815. During this raid the high level of
the Krishna River prevented the Pindaris from crossing it. The
Madras Presidency was, thus, probably saved from a luhbur. The
group raided along the<p>

<h5>++ Page 32</h5>

River as far as the frontier of Masulipatnam. They successfully
avoided the troops of Colonel Doveton, who was protecting the
Nizam's territories. The booty they carried back to Nimwar was so
large that merchants from Ujain had to come for its sale. <a href="#fn85">[85]</a> <p>
     Encouraged by this success, the Pindaris prepared for
another luhbur, larger than the first. It headed south in
February (1816). The luhbur crossed the western frontier of
Masulipatnam on March tenth and plundered and looted the 
Company's territories for the next twelve days. They especially
concentrated their activities on the Guntur and Caddapa
districts. The raid adequately demonstrated their swiftness and
destructiveness. In two days alone (March  eleventh and twelfth)
the luhbur plundered 146 villages and covered 76 miles. <a href="#fn86">[86]</a> Though
the Madras Government dispatched troops to intercept them, they
did not overtake the  Pindaris. The luhbur recrossed the Krishna
without a skirmish. Only once, in the Nizam's territory, Colonel
Doveton  surprised a small party of Pindaris. By May this group
had  returned safely to their base.<p>
     A commission, sent to assess the destruction caused by this
raid to Company property, reported the Pindaris had plundered 339
villages, killed 182 persons, wounded 505, and tortured 3,603. <a href="#fn87">[87]</a> 
Mr. Dalzell, in Guntur at the time of the raid, reported his
impressions as "the most consulate misery I ever recollect to
have witnessed." <a href="#fn88">[88]</a> He also recorded how an on-the-spot defense by
local <i><b>parias</b></i> (outcastes) had protected the collector's office
from being plundered, and of <p>

<h5>++ Page 33</h5>

the "heroic" inhabitants of Ainavole, who had burned themselves
and their village after failing to defend it against the
Pindari's.<a href="#fn89"> [89]</a> Other villagers deserted their homes for several
weeks and fled to the hills for protection. The British felt this
desertion showed that the people had lost confidence in the
protective power of the British. They considered this moral
injury much more serious than the material loss, estimated at
more than L100,000. <a href="#fn90">[90]</a> <p>
     By the following October (1816) Colonel Walker had
established a defensive line along the southern bank of the
Nerbudda River. Three groups of Pindaris finally evaded these
defenses after considerable difficulty. For simplicity, they can
be designated as the Bidar, Poona, and Gunjam luhburs. <p>
     The Bidar luhbur plundered around Bidar and Nirmal during
the later part of December. Owing to the indecision of their
leaders, they did not cross the Krishna or Tungabhadra Rivers
into the Company's Ceded districts. In the middle of January,
Major Macdowal surprised and completely routed them.  This caused
the group to disperse into small parties and return to their
base.  Another small party, under Shiekh Dulla, had separated
from the main Bidar group. It plundered the western coast of
India and encountered difficulty from British troops only in
recrossing the Nerbudda. <a href="#fn91">[91]</a> <p>
     The Poona luhbur entered the Peshwa's territory in the last
part of November. Major Lushington completely routed this group
on December twenty-sixth near Poona. With 350 men of the Madras
Light Cavalry he made an unusual march of<p>

<h5>++ Page 34 </h5>

70 miles in 17 hours. When he finally overtook the Pindari's
during their afternoon halt, his cavalry completely surprised
them. They killed or captured 800, while about 500 escaped. <a href="#fn92">[92]</a>  
These returned disorganized and also had trouble recrossing the
Nerbudda because of troops stationed there. <p>
     Of the three luhburs, only the Gunjam one penetrated into
British territory. The circumstances and conclusion of their raid
differed little from the others. After passing through Walker's
defenses, the luhbur, under Narsaika Ramzan, headed east and
appeared in the Northern Circars in mid-December. <a href="#fn93">[93]</a>  They first
plundered Kimedi, then almost all of the district, and finally
part of the town of Gunjam. Mr. Spottiswoode, collector of
Gunjam, reported the Pindaris took more than four lakhs of rupees
in money and Jewels from the town alone. <a href="#fn94">[94]</a> Again the people fled
for protection.  They especially feared that the Pindaris might
plunder Puri and the sacred temple of Jaganath. By the end of
December, however, the Pindaris had left without raiding these
places. British troops had overtaken them only twice. Once Major
Oliver attacked a small group after the Kimedi raid. Major
Brothwick more thoroughly dispersed them after the Gunjam raid.
This luhbur had difficulty returning to their base, even though
Wasil Muhammad (to whose durrah most of them belonged) had warned
them of the new defensive preparations. By this time the line of
defense had been extended further east and north from Walker's
original line. Captain Caulfield succeeded in attacking and
partially destroying this group.  Major Clarke also attacked the
fugitives. Only a few<p>

<h5>++ Page 35 </h5>

returned to their base unharmed. <a href="#fn95">[95]</a> <p>
     Except for two unsuccessful attempts to plunder in the east
in Bundelkhand, the Pindaris made no more raids into British
territory. During the rainy season of 1817, K&rim Khan tried to
convince other Pindari leaders to join him in a Pindari plan for
defense. Disagreements among the Pindari leaders, particularly
with Chitu, destroyed any hope of a concerted effort even in fa�e
of the impending war with the British. <p>

<center><h2><a name="brit">V. The British Reaction</a></h2></center>

       Several complex factors contributed to the establishment
of British control over India. From one perspective the British
achieved this by defeating other contenders. Of these the most
outstanding rivals were the Mughals, the Afghans, Tipu Sultan,
other European powers (especially the French), the Marathas, and
the Sikhs. The Pindaris never  sought to rule in India. They
nevertheless participated in the Maratha's final effort to share
in the control of  India. One of the main factors which
contributed to the successful achievement of British paramountcy
in the subcontinent was the decision and action taken to destroy
the Pindaris.<p>
     As early as 1804 General Wellesley had written, "we run a
great risk from the freebooter system." He warned that the people
feared the Pindaris so much they would not cultivate their fields
unless the Government stationed troops in each village . <a href="#fn96">[96]</a>  
Continued British expression of hostility toward the Pindaris
dates from this time. Several officials and observers favored a
"forward" or aggressive British policy. It found expression in
several different forms.<p>
     Eventually Government policy also reflected this same
opinion. After the wars, which established the British in Madras
and Bengal, a period of non-intervention in costly wars, and a
feeling that Indian affairs would take care of themselves
followed with Pitt's India Act of 1784. Lord <p>

<h5>++ Page 37</h5>

Wellesley, however, successfully reversed this policy during his
rule on the pretense of a French danger in India. But he went
beyond merely defeating the French bid for power ln India. He
defeated and allied other Indian states to the British. Reaction
to the debts incurred by his wars, an unsuccessful campaign
against Holkar, and the increasing danger of the French in Europe
provided reason for Wellesley's recall. From this time, though
the British recognized that eventual paramountcy was necessary
for a peaceful and prosperous trade and rule in India, they
postponed dealing with the issue until Lord Hasting's Governor-
generalship. <a href="#fn97">[97]</a> <p>
    Most historians place the responsibility for the growth of
the Pindaris on the treaties of 1805 and the policies of the
Cornwallis, Barlow, and the Minto administrations. <a href="#fn98">[98]</a> On the one
hand, the treaties weakened the Maratha princes. The rulers
disbanded their forces and cavalry which joined the Pindari
groups and made them more difficult to control. on the other
hand, the Government permitted enough freedom of internal policy
so that the Marathas could secretly encourage the Pindaris.<p> 
     In 1809 Captain Sydenham, Resident at the Bhonsla court,
presented one of the first thorough accounts of the Pindaris to
the Government. He reported that "the incursions of these common
enemies of peace and tranquility are so regular as the periodic
returns of the monsoon." His opinion stated that "the extirpation
of such a race of men would he not only a measure of policy, but
a service to<p>

<h5>++ Page 38 </h5>

humanity itself." He advised that no system of defense nor
distribution of troops would be able to protect any area, since
the Pindaris were so evasive. <a href="#fn99">[99]</a> Sydenham's statement set the main
arguments which writers, who had seen the Pindaris or knew much
about them, expressed during the next decade. <p>
     British writers presented four principal, related reasons
why the Government should destroy the Pindaris. First, the
Government should replace the anarchy, which the Pindaris had
created, with a regular and responsible government. The Pindaris
were a symptom of the disease which would eventually engulf and
destroy central India, if not checked. <a href="#fn100">[100]</a>   Second, the Pindaris
destroyed life and property on their luhburs as exemplified in
the 1816 raid on the Madras Presidency. Their attacks provided
zamindars and ryots with reasons to falsely claim lower revenue
payments. <a href="#fn101">[l01]</a>  Thirdly, the Pindaris morally damaged the image of
the "protecting Company" in the eyes of the people. The villagers
had 
<blockquote>
          convinced themselves as living under the protection of
          a power whose very name was a sufficient barrier of
          defense: the contrary has been proved to them; and on
          the report of danger they now fly to the hills,
          nullahs, and to the sea-shore, rather than rely on the
          protection of a power which has once proved inadequate
          to the task. <a href="#fn102">[102]</a> </blockquote>

Thus, the British had to annihilate the Pindaris as a "sacred 
duty to shield" the subjects of the King of Great Britain "from
further ravages and misery...." <a href="#fn103">[l03]</a>  Fourth, (even though the
Pindaris created anarchy) their increasing power became a threat
to British stability. The British feared <p>

<h5>++ Page 39</h5>

that the Pindaris would establish themselves following the
Maratha pattern. <a href="#fn104">[104]</a> <p>
     The Government devised two "milder methods" or alternatives
to deal with the Pindari menace before they decided on a policy
of [till-scale war. First, they encouraged the Maratha chiefs to
destroy or control the Pindaris by themselves. Second, Lord
Hastings promoted a policy of defense or containment.- The
Government stationed troops along the southern bank of the
Nerbudda River below the Pindari bases. Their dual responsibility
was to keep the Pindaris within their central Indian bases and
destroy them as they returned from expeditions. The British felt
both of these methods were never fully successful. Consequently,
they chose a policy of full-scale war. <p>
     Lord Hastings is responsible for the conception and 
eventual execution of this policy. He had not always favored a
policy of expansion and aggression in India, but upon his arrival
in India in 1813 he began to advocate placing the British in a
paramount position in India. <a href="#fn105">[105]</a> For many years the opposition of
the Court of Directors and his own Council prevented him from
acting on this judgement.<p>
     The Court of Directors had strictly prohibited the Company
in India "from engaging in plans of general confederacy, and
offensive operations against the Pindaris either with a view to
their utter extirpation, or in anticipation of an apprehended
danger." <a href="#fn106">[106]</a>   In spite of this, Lord Hastings continued to urge his
policy for the tranquilization of central India. It involved not
only the<p>

<h5>++ Page 40 </h5>

elimination of the Pindaris but the establishment of a
confederacy of native states headed by Britain. He formally
presented this policy to the Council in Calcutta in 1815 but they
rejected it. <a href="#fn107">[107]</a> <p>
     Through their activities the Pindaris played a prominent
role in formulating the policy of Lord Hastings and  the Court of
Directors. Lord Hastings continually received reports of Pindari
destructiveness. <a href="#fn108">[108]</a>  Reacting to the reports of the raids in
1815-1816, he wrote, <p>
<blockquote>
          ...I am strictly forbidden by the Court of 
     Directors to undertake the suppression of the 
     fiends who occasioned this heart rendering 
     scene (the self-destruction of Unioval), least 
     I should provoke a war with the Marathas . <a href="#fn109">[109 ]</a> </blockquote>

     After the Court received the report of these same raids,
they sent Lord Hastings reluctant permission to "suppress the
Pindaris and destroy their further means of action." <a href="#fn110">[110]</a>   Already
in Calcutta, however, the Council had passed a resolution before
they received this communication. In response to the raids during
late 1816 in the northern Circars, they stated they could no
longer refrain "from any system of offensive operations against
the Pindaris...."  They unanimously decided "that the adoption of
vigorous measures for the early suppression of the Pindaris has
become an indispensable obligation of our public duty." <a href="#fn111">[111]</a> <p>
     Supported with this sanction of his-Council, Lord Hastings
began to execute his plan for the destruction of the Pindaris.
Since M. S. Mehta has adequately and fully dealt with the
relations between the Pindaris, Indian States, and the British
Government in his book, it is sufficient to <p>

<h5>++ Page 41 </h5>

relate only some of the salient features of these events here. <a href="#fn112">[112]</a> <p>
     Lord Hastings first prepared for the war by concluding
treaties with the several states around the Pindaris. These
treaties contained stipulations that the states would cooperate
with the British against the Pindaris and would offer 
Pindari parties no refuge within their states. In justifying this
step, Lord Hastings claimed, "I have insisted on rendering the
British government safe against the growth of any similar pest"
(like the Pindaris) by binding states to Britain, which can crush
such associations in their bud. <a href="#fn113">[113]</a>  In actuality, these treaties
provided for the permanent submission of the states to the Crown
of England. With few exceptions and changes, they were the basis
for British power and control of these areas for the next 130
years. <p>
     Sindhia, whom the Pindaris had often acknowledged as their
nominal leader, presented a special problem. In recent years the
British Government had regarded him with suspicion.  Officials
thought that of all the native powers, he was in the best
position and had the means to control the Pindaris.  He had kept
Karim Khan in confinement for several years. After Karim Khan's
release and his subsequent attempt to plunder Sindhia's
territory, Sindhia had defeated him. After that, Karim Khan was
forced to seek the protection of Amir Khan and Holkar. Another
time, when the Pindaris had raided British territory, he sent a
force against them to control them. But this force was
unsuccessful. British officials generally recognized that he had
dispatched these <p>

<h5>++ Page 42 </h5>

troops in order to placate the British rather than suppress the
Pindaris. <a href="#fn114">[114]</a> <p>
     Just before the campaign opened, Lord Hastings forced
Sindhia to choose sides. Either he could cooperate with the
British against the Pindaris or be treated as an enemy.
Meanwhile, the British troops had assembled for the campaign in
the north. They were close enough to threaten Sindhia's
territory. Sindhia signed the treaty in late October. <p>
     Amir Khan, the Raja of Bhopal, several Rajput states, and
others also concluded treaties with the British at this time. The
British had completed "political arrangements" for the war. <p>
     Lord Hastings' plan for the war showed caution, foresight,
and ingenuity. He proposed to destroy the Pindaris by surrounding
them, driving them from their bases, and slowly closing the
circle while preventing them from escaping. He placed reserve
troops to deal with any hostile acts, which the Maratha or native
princes might attempt. Lieutenant-Colonel Blacker has provided
the most complete account of the Third Maratha and Pindari War.
The account, like others, concentrates on the movements of British
troops with only a few references to the Pindaris. <a href="#fn115">[115]</a> 
Nevertheless, it is necessary to examine this last period of
Pindari activity.<p>
     During October 1816, British troops took positions to the
north and south of central India in preparations for the war. The
Bengal forces in the north consisted of four divisions.
Major-General Brown commanded the Center Division <p>

<h5>++ Page 43 </h5>

at Kanpur, Major-General Donkin the Right Division at Agra,
Major-General Marshall the Right Division in Bundelkhund, and Sir
D. Ochterloney the Reserve Division near Delhi. In the south Sir
Thomas Hislop commanded the five divisions of the Army of the
Deccan with the First Division directly under him.
Brigadier-General Doveton led the Second Division of Hyderabad
troops, Brigadier-General Malcolm the Third, Brigadier-General L.
Smith the Fourth Division of Poona, and Lieutenant-Colonel Adams
the Fifth of Nagpur. Brigadier-General Pritzler led a Reserve
Division, while Major-General Keir commanded the troops from
Gujerat. Lord Hastings took the field as commander-in-chief over
all the troops.<p>
     Four main phases distinguish the movements against the
Pindaris, conveniently corresponding to the months of November,
December, January, and February. <p>
     During the last half of November, the British troops in the
south crossed the Nerbudda River, occupied the bases of the
Pindaris, and began pursuing them as they fled to the north. The
Third Division under Malcolm invaded Chitu's possessions, while
the Fifth Division under Adams marching northwestward, and the
Left Division under Marshall marching westward, occupied the
lands of Karim Khan and Wasil Muhammed. The combined durrahs of
Karim Khan and Wasil Muhammad along with their families and
baggage headed for Gwalior. Chitu's durrah joined Holkar's forces
in the meantime. Malcolm, who was pursuing him, retreated to
a safe position not daring to attack this combination. The First <p>

<h5>++ Page 44 </h5>

Division under Hislop finally joined him, and they took a
position north of Ujain ln preparation to attack Holkar. 
Major-General Keir at the same time proceeded toward these
Divisions from Gujerat. <p>
     During December the British prevented the Pindaris from
seeking refuge under Sindhia, the Raja of Kota, and Holkar. In
close pursuit of the Pindaris, they attacked them several times.
First, a cavalry brigade from the Center Division cut off the
Pindaris' communication and march to Sindhia at Gwalior. The
Pindaris then headed  toward the territory of the Raja of Kota.
For a short time  they remained in this area but only after
defeating some of the Raja's troops who were protecting his
frontier. A light cavalry from Marshall's forces overtook the
Pindaris, defeated a group of about 1,000, and pursued the
remaining 2,000 to the Prabati River. Donkin with the Right
Division had marched to a position eight miles from Kota. He
captured the baggage and families of Karim Khan's durrah, as they
fled northward in his direction. Though Karim Khan  avoided
contact with Donkin and Marshall's forcer, further south on the
Prabati, Adams dispatched Clarke with some cavalry who routed a
party of this group. Karim Khan then joined Holkar s forces to
the west. During the last part of the month Donkin received word
that Chitu's forces were near Kota. By the time he reached the
area, Chitu had fled to Jeswant Rao Bhao of Jawad.<p>
     During January the war reached the turning point. The
British invaded the Jawad area and occupied the last place

<h5>++ Page 45 </h5>

where the Pindaris sought refuge. All Pindari parties eventually
returned south near their bases, with the British in close
pursuit. During the last part of December, at the invitation of
Jeswant Rao Bhao, Karim Khan had ridden north from Holkar's camp,
while Chitu had come west from Kota into the area around Jawad.
British forces surrounded them on all sides. Donkin moved west to
prevent a northern escape. Adams was to the southeast, while
Brown from the Center Division moved into a position east of
Jawad. Keir and Grant proceeded north pursuing the Pindaris after
Holkar's defeat. As Grant occupied the area around Jawad, Keir
prevented Chitu from circumventing the British forces to the
west. Both Chitu and Karim Khan began moving south toward their
bases at the Nerbudda. By the last part of January, Chitu had
evaded British troops and proceeded to the ghats. Heath at Hindia
received information of his party. He pursued, attacked, and
completely dispersed the group. Chitu fled to Bhopal, where he
tried to reach an agreement with the British through the Nawab.
The British rejected his plans as too extravagant. Returning to
central India, Karim Khan's group split into three bodies, but
the British troops still detected them. Clarke's cavalry attacked
one group around Gangraur, while Adams pursued the rest into the
Bhopal area.<p>
     In February most of the Pindari leaders surrendered to the
British authorities. Namdar Khan gave himself up on February
third, and Karim Khan surrendered to Malcolm on the  fifteenth.
Others gradually followed their example. Only <p>

<h5>++ Page 46 </h5>

Chitu escaped. He participated in the events connected with Appa
Sahib at Nagpur but eventually fled to the jungle, deserted by
his followers. Near the end of February 1819 his body was brought
to Malcolm. He had been attacked and killed by a tiger. <a href="#fn116">[116]</a> <p>
     For the British the campaign against the Pindaris had been
completely aggressive. The enemy always fled. They never made a
prolonged stand nor attacked British forces. The British
succeeded in destroying the Pindaris only through continued
pursuit and relying completely on the mobility of their cavalry
forces. In this way they sometimes overtook the Pindaris groups
and gradually reduced their numbers.  A few areas provided local
support and refuge to the Pindaris, but these were only temporary
until the British discovered them.<p>
     During the campaign other significant events had occurred.
The Peshwa, Holkar, and Appa Sahib had all "rebelled" against the
British and had been defeated. At the end of the campaign in 1819
the British had suppressed the "predatory" powers of central
India. The area was now free from the misery of plundering
horsemen and anarchy. <a href="#fn117">[117]</a>  As one Indian soldier remarked? "The
name of the Company Bahadoor became great." <a href="#fn118">[118]</a>  Now capable men,
such as Elphinstone in Bombay and Malcolm in central India, laid
the foundations of that type of administration which became the
hallmark of British rule in India for the next 130 years.<p>
     In conJunction with British consolidation after the war,
John Malcolm arranged for the Pindari leaders and <p>

<h5>++ Page 47</h5>

their families to settle in northern India at Gorakpur with 
pensions and land. <a href="#fn119">[119]</a>  To prevent any resurgence of the Pindaris, 
the British permitted only Namdar Khan, Karim Khan's nephew, to 
settle in Bhopal near the old banes of the Pindaris. Karim Khan's
lands provided 16,000 rupees annually, while Kadir Bukhsh's lands
yielded 400 rupees. Ironically, in 1822 dacoits from Oudh 
attacked Kadir Bukhsh's house. They killed four of his people, 
wounded many, and took some of his property. <a href="#fn120">[120]</a> <p>
     About a century later a Gorakpur gazetteer reported the
inglorious history of the Pindari descendants and their land. The
land had passed from rent-free to assessed land though the
revenue was very low. The descendants lived in pretentious
opulence with the title of Nawab, which the Government refused to
recognize. <a href="#fn121">[121]</a> <p>
     Though a few leaders, such as Sheikh Dulla, continued to
plunder the Deccan areas during the 1820's, their followers were
few and their devastation minimal. <a href="#fn122">[122]</a>  By 1825 Malcolm reported
that most of the Pindaris had become absorbed into the general
population of central India. He found it difficult to trace them.
 <a href="#fn123">[123]</a>  Other groups and events now occupied the center of the Indian
stage of history.<p>

<center><h2><a name="summ">VI. Summary and Conclusions </a></h2></center>
<hr width="75%">
     In reviewing Pindari history one is struck by several themes
and problems. These provide an understanding of the development
of the Pindaris, besides raising serious doubts about the
accepted ideas of the nature of Pindari society and British
policy toward them.<p> 
     The Pindaris developed within a traditional Indian
framework. Their history after 1800 during the Independent Period
shows a continuity with their previous Muslim and Maratha Periods
in spite of the transformation of circumstances surrounding them.
During the last part of the seventeenth century, Muslim leaders
were the first to employ the Pindaris. At that time the Pindaris
served in conjunction with Muslim armies against the enemy in the
Deccan. During the eighteenth century the Marathas organized and
recognized the Pindaris as part of their military system. The
Maratha chiefs utilized them as an efficient and effective unit
who destroyed the enemy's resources and demanded no payment
except the wealth they plundered. As Maratha power declined and
the British strengthened their position in India, the utility of
the Pindaris became less apparent to Maratha chiefs. The British
irritation toward them increased. During this Independent Period,
the Pindaris, nevertheless, developed along traditional patterns
rather than inventing new methods in response to the changing
situation. Their two nominal leaders, Holkar and Sindhia,
recognized and awarded them lands and titles in the same wag as <p>

<h5>++ Page 49 </h5>

the Muslims and Marathas had awarded Jagirs to other military
commanders for their achievements. The Pindari chiefs settled
their families and followers in these areas and forced payments
of land revenue ln the usual Indian manner. Even with these
moderating influences of land-holding and settling ln central
India and though their nominal leaders no longer requested their
participation in wars of consolidation or expansion, the Pindaris
refused to relinquish their habit of planning luhburs and
plundering. With no clear distinction between enemy and ally, all
areas became fair game. Eventually, the Pindaris selected the
Nizam, the British, and sometimes the Bhonsla as "enemy" land.
They generally abstained from devastating the territories of
their previous benefactors, Sindhia, Holkar, and the Peshwa.<p> 
     During the same time British policy toward the Pindaris also
reveals a consistent development. Wellesley was the first to
recognize that the British must destroy the Pindaris to attain
control of India. With his recall, the pendulum swung-in the
opposite direction. For a period the British wished to refrain
from extensive involvement with the Indian states. As early as
1809, however, one British observer near the scene of Pindari
activity began to advocate a policy to deal with the Pindari
menace. Slowly other Government officials sought this same
policy. Lord Hastings was the first Governor-General in several
years desirous and willing to commit British troops and resources
to their destruction. Another five years lapsed, however, before
reports of Pindari raids, and his demands from India convinced
the Court of<p>

<h5>++ Page 50</h5>

Directors in London that the British could no longer tolerate
this menace. <p>
     The cooperative treaties concluded with Indian states in
central India, the military preparations, and the events of the
war successfully hindered the achievements of Pindari and Maratha
aspirations. These activities and events prevented the
materialization of a coordinated effort against the British.
Pindari groups fled before the enemy as the British continuously
closed all avenues of necessary assistance or escape. The end of
the war and the establishment of British control meant a complete
transformation of the situation in which the Pindaris had
functioned for one and a half centuries. No power accepted their
special abilities as legitimate or beneficial to their purposes. <p>
     Accepted ideas about the Pindaris vary considerably from the
above general presentation as well as to more specific aspects.
The traditional picture conceives the Pindaris as a group
composed of the worst villains of society who suddenly arose
after 1800 and increased their numbers rapidly. Their only desire
was to plunder, rape, murder, and burn. By these full-time
activities they caused wide-spread anarchy and destroyed mu�h of
the productive ability of India. <a href="#fn124">[124]</a> <p>
     Any close examination, however, even of the British sources
of this period makes such a view unacceptable. In order to more
completely understand this period, one must attempt to
reconstruct both the "Pindari" and the "British" points of view. <p>

<h5>++ Page 51</h5>

     The Pindari considered his occupation more than simply a
military career. He refused to rely on regular pay. Through
destroying and plundering the enemy' B camps and resources, he
earned his living and served his military commander. When weather
or peaceful conditions prevented this occupation, his leaders
provided areas in which he settled among the other inhabitants.
Every source indirectly indicates that at such times he obeyed
prevalent customs of Indian society. If his income from his chief
or creditors proved insufficient, he often earned his living
through a variety of occupations. <a href="#fn125">[125]</a>  As the <i><b>dharma</b></i> or law of a
farmer prescribed that he should cultivate crops before the
monsoons, the Pindari's dharma prescribed that he should plunder
after the monsoons. Popular acceptance and even support of the
Pindari indicates that the Indians, as well as the Pindari
himself, viewed his occupation as legitimate. On luhburs the
Pindari committed atrocities, plundered, and burned crops and
villages from the conviction that he was acting in a warlike
situation against an enemy. <p>
     Such a view of Pindari society dose not justify their
destructiveness or atrocities. Rather, it demonstrates the role
of the Pindari in Indian society in this period. Certainly, it
partially destroys the myth that the Pindaris were full-time
enemies of society whose only ambition and occupation was to
plunder.<p>
     The Pindaris also did not cause widespread anarchy. The
treaties of 1802-05 introduced a new period into central  
India. Though the British did not directly control the area,<p>

<h5>++ Page 52</h5>

their power was more evident than ever before. British forces
patrolled Hyderabad and Poona and along Sindhia's frontier.
Residents closely reviewed events at most of the Courts. Indian
rulers remembered the defeats they had suffered from the British
in the Second Maratha War. They, therefore, acted cautiously to
insure against arousing British disapproval and consequential
complete defeat. Though British treaties successfully restricted
the actions of Indian rulers, they failed to form treaties with
the subordinate or secondary powers in central India. The
Pindaris and Pathans seized the opportunity to extend their
power. They proceeded in the traditional manner of bringing
areas under control and receiving the ruler's recognition of
their right to the revenue of these areas. Pindari leaders, a
generation earlier, had acquired lands through a similar process.
Only a few writers, therefore, could include this traditional
process of the transferal of power within a very broad definition
of anarchy. <p>
     One of the most difficult problems to assess is the
accusation that the Pindaris were responsible for the destruction
of much of India's productive capacity. Economic and social
studies of this period and immediately after it support no such
hypothesis. <a href="#fn126">[126]</a>  Rather the Pindaris affected limited areas only
temporarily. Even the exceptional Guntur-Caddapah raid during
1816 directly affected a small proportion of the villages and
raised food prices for only a short time. Though the Pindari
luhburs extended into several parts of India, they destroyed the
productive <p>

<h5>++ Page 53</h5>

capacity of those areas in a very restricted sense. <p>
     The historical sources for this period provide insufficient
evidence that the numbers of the Pindaris increased
significantly. The first estimate of the Pindaris in 1809
reported numbers as large as the estimates during the following
decade. It is also possible that Pindari membership did not
double from 1800 to 1809. Rather, such a speculation conveniently
supported the British observer's desire to attract Government
attention to an "increasing" menace.<p> 
     As an understanding of Pindari society contributes to a more
complete picture of India in the early nineteenth century
society, so does the examination of British attitudes and ideas.
British officials selected and emphasized only certain aspects of
the Pindaris. They based their selectivity on the necessity to
morally justify their actions. Their choice of words,
exaggerations, and repetitions demonstrate this. British writers
viewed the Pindaris as enemies of society, pests, swarms of
locusts, the lowest form of freebooters and banditti, a scourge
and plague on the earth, fiends, and "masses of putrefaction in
animal matter." <a href="#fn127">[127]</a> The British constantly repeated and magnified
the worst atrocities of the Pindaris, especially their raping of
women and the complete destruction of Ainavole. They were
convinced that the Pindaris were an unusual and inhuman forge. An
such, the British had to deal with them through exceptional
methods expressed by the terms -- suppress, extirpate, eliminate,
or destroy. Simply "defeating" them would have admitted <p>

<h5>++ Page 54</h5>

them within the realm of humanity. The British felt that they had
a moral duty to terminate this evil and provide a peaceful life
for the inhabitants. <p>
     Two incidents especially reflect this British attitude.
During the period that the Court of Directors in London still
withheld permission to suppress the Pindaris, they proposed that
Lord Hastings might deal with the Pindaris by playing off one
faction against another. The words used in the response of the
Governor-General reveals his attitude: <p>
<blockquote>
          ...I am roused to the fear that we have been
          culpably deficient in pointing out to the author)"
          ties at home, the brutal and atrocious qualities
          of those <i><b>wretches</b></i>. Had we not failed to describe
          sufficiently the horror and execration in which 
          the Pindaris are justly held, I am satisfied that
          nothing could have been more <i><b>repugnant </b></i>to the
          feelings of the Honourable Committee, than the
          notion that this Government should be <i><b>soiled</b></i> by
          a procedure which was to bear the colour of 
          confidential intercourse of a common cause, with
          any of those <i><b>gangs</b></i>. <a href="#fn128">[128]</a> </blockquote>
     The second incident demonstrates two assessments of the
Pindaris. First, the destruction of the Pindaris constituted an
essential ingredient in Lord Hastings' policy of paramountcy.
Without this justification, the conclusion of the treaties, which
also required the submission of Indian states to British power,
would not have been possible. Second, the British refused to
accept the Pindaris as a regular power. Near the end of the
Pindari war, in February 1818, Chitu negotiated with the British
through the Nawab of Bhopal. <a href="#fn129">[129]</a>  He demanded a Jagir and that the
British accept his troops into their-army. The British refused to
accept these terms. Three months previously, however, they <p>

<h5>++ Page 55 </h5>

had concluded a treaty with Amir Khan containing exactly the same
terms . <a href="#fn130">130 </a> The treaty provided him with a jagir, the area of Tonk
in perpetuity, and requisitioned some of his troops into the
British forces. Evidently Amir Khan was exempt from British wrath
because he and his cavalry had devastated and committed
atrocities in Rajputana instead of in British territories. The
British denied the Pindari leaders any terms short of
"unconditional surrender," though the Pindaris proposed them. <p>
     It is clear that any thorough appraisal of Pindari history
results in the revision of the traditional view. In the future,
examinations of the Pindaris might produce four views. Each would
emphasize certain aspects and present an oversimplified and
unbalanced account. They can be characterized as Imperialistic,
Romantic, Marxist, and Nationalistic. The Imperialistic view
would be a restatement of the traditional view. It proposes that
the British Government in India brought peace, prosperity and
civilization to an area devastated by uncontrolled hordes of
robbers and ruled by incompetent princes. <p>
     A Romantic approach would utilize the Pindari in a similar
way that United States television writers have thoroughly
exploited the heroes of the West. This view would emphasize the
carefree and rugged Pindari life. It would present him as the
embodiment of a skillful, daring, courageous, and adventurous
horseman. Riding swiftly across the Deccan plain on his trusty
horse, his spear protruding upright, he would surprise and
plunder British villages.<p>

<h5>++ Page 56</h5>

     Marxists would have difficulty justifying the annexation of
this area in purely economic terms. The British sought to acquire
this area of India, not to provide raw materials or markets for
British goods, but as a moral duty and for strategic purposes to
unite the intermediate area between their three Presidencies.
Lord Hastings' economic reasons hardly correspond to a possible
Marxist ideology. Before a court of inquiry he stated that it was
less expensive to destroy Pindari power in one campaign than to
maintain British defensive troops and permit the yearly
devastation of British territories. <a href="#fn131">[131]</a>  Only the long period of
the Director's reluctance and refusal to invest Company funds in
a costly war could possibly provide the Marxists with an argument
somewhat consistent with his philosophy. <p>
     Indian Nationalists can view this period with more optimism.
They could present the Pindari as the last heterogeneous group,
before the Mutiny, who resisted the expanding alien rule of
Britain. Historical events, however, hardly substantiate this
view. The Pindaris increasingly became more independent after
1800 as the British forced Maratha states to bind themselves to
the British Government. In this situation the Pindaris eventually
selected to devastate the territories of the "enemy," Britain and
their close ally, the Nizam. Before the 1817-19 War, the Peshwa,
Bhonsla, Sindhia, Holkar and the Pindaris sought to
coordinate a plan to resist the British invasion. Sources provide
no specific details about Pindari intentions through this
alliance. It ia impossible to discover the degree to which the
Pindaris<p>

<h5>++ Page 57 </h5>

consciously chose to plunder British territory and unite in a
defense. A Nationalist could deduce that the Pindaris recognized
the British as their enemies and actively subscribed to a plan to
resist them. Evidence, however, indicates another possible
motive, a materialistic one. Pindari groups primarily plundered
British territories for their wealth and prosperity. They would
have raided other areas if they were equally prosperous. Before
the War the Raja of Berar formalized arrangements with Chitu
which offered him 5,000 rupees to cooperate with his troops
against the British. <a href="#fn132">[132]</a>  These instances throw some doubt on any
Nationalist proposal that the Pindaris recognized the British
threat to India and worked for their destruction. <p>
     Writers often compared the Pindaris with other groups. Among
these were the Marathas and Pathans within India, and the Saharan
Taureq, the Russian Cossacks, the Central Asian Tartars, and the
Italian condottieri. The suggested similarities were often
superficial or even falsely based. For instance, the
identification of the Pindaris with the Taureq rested solely on
the false proposition that both were primarily nomadic. <a href="#fn133">[133]</a> The
condottieri proposal incorrectly presumed a feudal situation ln
India. In spite of these drawbacks, however, other comparisons
contribute to the consideration of the Pindaris outside the
Anglo-Indian context, thus extending the perspective of their
study. This paper briefly considers two specific cases and one
general framework. These are the Cossacks, the Buccaneers, and
guerrilla-type warfare.<p>

<h5>++ Page 58  </h5>   

     Like the Pindaris, the Cossacks were originally a
heterogeneous society, composed of a variety of people fleeing
from their past because of the imposition of a rule they disliked
or had broken. <a href="#fn134">[134]</a> Unlike the Pindaris, they eventually
established themselves as a distinct society fashioning and
fashioned by the frontier they conquered. Areas became identified
with their name because they not only controlled them, but
settled on them as the majority of the population. They resembled
the Pindaris more in military customs than social culture, and
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries than the
subsequent centuries. <p>
     The Cossack cavalry consisted of irregular, undisciplined,
but highly skillful, rugged, and courageous horsemen. They
learned to travel light, far and fast through rough, and often
unfamiliar, terrain. During the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries Russian and Polish rulers employed the
Cossack to defend their frontiers against Tartar attacks. Later
the Cossack prominently contributed to the extension of the
Russian frontier eastward into Siberia. Eventually he became a
distinguished part of the Russian military system. <p>
     Both the Pindaris and the Cossacks were famed for their
lawlessness in enemy territory but peacefulness at home. Yet
while the Pindaris conformed to the society in which his family
lived, the Cossacks created their own society. They gradually
established the traditions of elected assemblies and leaders,
communal lands, and their<p>

<h5>++ Page 59</h5>

own recognized laws. Though usually uneducated, they adhered
fervently to an orthodox Christian faith which added zeal to the
occasional lacerative attacks on "barbarian" Tartar lands .<p> 
     The more than four centuries of Cossack history contrasts
sharply to the two centuries of Pindari history ln their social
and religious customs, their continued utility to the Russian
state, and their eventual adaptation and partial incorporation to
the changing situation around them. The striking similarities to
the Pindaris of fighting habits, skills, and lawlessness existed
for only a limited time and to a restricted degree. <p>
     In spite of the separation ln geographical location and
difference of terrain, the Buccaneers of the West Indies resemble
the Cossacks. <a href="#fn135">[135]</a> During the seventeenth century, in response to a
frontier situation of a sparsely populated and unsettled land,
they skillfully adapted to the situation and eventually
established their own set of laws. They also maintained the
vestiges of their religion. Though almost all Europeans, they
were originally fugitives from the restrictions of established
society, the economic and political outcasts of several nations.
For many years they harassed a common enemy, the Spaniards, and
protected and enriched infant colonies. The British and French
governors employed them since they lacked the funds for regular
military forces. In payment, the Buccaneers kept the plunder they
obtained. <p>
     Like the Pindaris and Cossacks, the Buccaneer, though<p>

<h5>++ Page 60</h5>

transported on a ship instead of a horse, relied on mobility,
surprise, and the protection of his terrain, the open sea. He was
a brave, cruel, tough seaman, and an excellent navigator. Both
the Buccaneers and Pindaris were infamous to their enemies and
useful to their allies because of their ability to destroy. The
Buccaneer raids on Puerto Bello and Panama are especially noted
for the pillage, torture, and devastation they caused. The
Buccaneer also secured no victories. Instead, regular naval
squadrons (comparable to regular Maratha armies) achieved these.
Unlike the Pindari, however, the Buccaneer attacked strongholds
and fought formal enemy forces. Even so, these strongholds always
promised a sizable loot, and the Buccaneers refused to waste
effort on less prosperous prospects. <p>
     By the end of the century the Buccaneer bands disappeared
from the Caribbean. Only the prolonged efforts of governors, such
as Morgan (himself once a buccaneer) and du Casse, the desire for
more regular trade, and the settlement of Buccaneers on
plantations produced this result. As the Cossacks, the Buccaneers
adapted to a changing situation and escaped the fate of a war
directed against them.<p>
     For modern experts of military strategy and world affairs,
guerrilla warfare is a controversial, contemporary, and crucial
problem. <a href="#fn136">[136]</a> The abundant recent literature concentrates on
examples from the period after the second world war and faire to
agree on a precise definition. In spite of this a few
propositions are possible) Guerrilla warfare is a restricted form
of warfare, which independent and<p>

<h5>++ Page 61</h5>

quasi-military groups wage usually beyond or on enemy lines and
in connection with regular troops and a war. The groups desire to
achieve some political goal through their activities of
harassing, raiding, capturing, destroying, or redirecting the
enemy's forces and supplies. A guerrilla movement requires at
least passive popular support and a difficult terrain to provide
supplies, intelligence, recuperation, and security. It is a
transitory phase and self-defeating in that its intended result
is successful withdrawal of the enemy and the establishment of a
government. <p>
     Pindari activities conform to several aspects of this
definition, while contradictions and deviations preclude its
inclusion within the total framework. At greatest variance are
the aspects of a definite political goal, popular support, and
activity behind enemy lines in conjunction with a war and allied
troops. The Pindaris, as already mentioned, articulated no
political goal. Rather, they appear primarily motivated by the
desire to plunder, though still willing to raid areas which their
leaders and the Marathas defined as enemy territory. The populace
often supported the Pindaris but usually under duress through the
threat of violence or reprisals. During the Pindari War, the
reluctance of inhabitants to provide intelligence about Pindari
movements often prevented British troops from continuing their
pursuit of Pindari bands. Maratha leaders admired the Pindari
methods of fighting and often promised them asylum and
protection. Fakirs, sadhus, and other travellers willingly
provided Pindaris with necessary intelligence of troop movements 
and <p>

<h5>++ Page 62</h5>
 
the progress of other Pindari parties.<p>
     The Pindaris did not restrict their activity to behind or on
enemy lines. Factionalism among themselves and the Maratha
leaders provided ample opportunity for plundering within "allied"
territory. During the Independent Period they also operated
during a time of peace, and independent of allied troops. Their
activities with the Marathas on campaigns into Hindustan and the
Deccan during the eighteenth century and the plan to co-ordinate
their efforts with the Marathas in the Pindari War indicate that,
within the total context of Pindari history, independent luhburs
were the exception rather than the rule.<p>
     Despite the aims of the Pindaris, their irregular method of
warfare closely resembled guerrilla tactics. They were mobile,
small units operating in a rugged terrain. They surprised the
enemy, destroyed his resources and escaped through country in
which pursuit was difficult. They avoided conventional
engagements with enemy forces. As Indians who knew the language
and culture and were familiar with the area, they had an
advantage over the alien white officers. The Pindari weapons of
the lance and the sword were not the most modern but,
nevertheless, they were effective and required little maintenance
and no ammunition. Without the usual military training,
organization or discipline, they were a quasi-military group.
They ultimately depended, as did any guerrilla movement, on the
outside support of a regular military system. Once the enemy
controlled that, all the other guerrilla type practices of the
Pindaris were ineffectual.<p>

<h5>++ Page 63</h5>
 
     A comparison of the Pindaris, Buccaneers, and Cossacks
reveals several common features. Originating during transitional
periods, the diverse members of these societies gradually
developed distinct social, political, economic, and military
customs. Ruling states, within which these societies occupied
subordinate positions, sought to restrain their military
activities by channeling them against the enemy. The result
benefited both the rulers and the irregular forces. Because of
the lack of funds and resources, or because of binding peace
treaties, the governments employed the irregular groups to
destroy and harass the enemy or to defend certain areas. Many of
the tactics, which these groups used, resembled guerrilla-type
warfare. In return for their activities, the groups obtained
privileged concessions from the governments, especially the right
to plundered goods and the assurance of restricted governmental
interference in the groups t affairs. Eventually, circumstances
changed so that governments sought more peaceful conditions and
stricter control over these groups and areas. The destructive
activities of these groups threatened such developments. The
French bought off Buccaneer leaders. The British outlawed
Buccaneer activities and offered attractive alternative
occupations, such as owning plantations. The Russians
incorporated the Cossacks within their military system.<p>
     In retrospect, it appears unusual that the British refused
to negotiate with the Pindaris and otter them legitimate
positions in Indian society or the incorporation of<p>

<h5>++ Page 64</h5>

their cavalry into the British army. The proportion and esteem of
the Gurkhas and the Sikh (both of whom at one time fought against
British expansion) exemplifies such a possibility. Only Lord
Hastings' contempt for the Pindaris and the convenience of
concluding treaties and waging a war against them to establish
British paramountcy in India excluded a more peaceful
alternative. <p>
     Most significantly, a comparative examination of the
Pindaris, Cossacks, Buccaneers, and guerrilla warfare contributes
to a more objective interpretation of the Pindaris. The Pindari
atrocities, their tortures, their mundane desire for plunder,
their irregular methods -- none of these are the exclusive
characteristics of the Pindaris.<p>
     An enduring assessment of the Pindaris in Indian history
cannot be content with an overemphasis of the "immoral" actions
of the Pindaris during luhburs or exaggeration of their threat to
the peace and prosperity of India. Such treatment considers only
the military and moral aspects at the expense of the social,
political, and economic. <p>
     A thorough study of the Pindaris reflects many things. In
part, it reveals the dynamic situation which the war and treaties
of 1802-05 caused. The defeated rulers signed restrictive
treaties, while semi-independent and subordinate groups increased
their base and strength of power. This transformation occurred
within a traditional pattern. As such it had little disruptive
effects on the population. In spite of factionalism between
central Indian leaders, the Marathas' interest in, and indirect
encouragement of, Pindari<p>

<h5>++ Page 65</h5>

activities exemplifies a common dissatisfaction with the existing
situation and their frustration with the restrictive treaties. <p>
     Pindari history finally reflects the inflexible British
attitudes during this period. However incorrect British ideas
were about Pindari society, their selection, emphasis, and
propagation of the most destructive aspects conveniently provided
the necessary support to Lord Hastings' policy of British
paramountcy in India.

produced an equal number of males as females, did not practice

of 3,000 killed in the war and the 2,000 settled outside central

number is accepted, such as 10,000 instead of 20,000, it is still
difficult to account for the absorption and disappearance of this
number except with such a theory as suggested here. 

     <a name="fn52">52.</a>  Malcolm, <i><b>Central India</b></i>, II, p. 176-77. 

     <a name="fn53">53.</a>  Additional circumstances support such a statement. The
25,000 Pindaris formed only a small portion of the population in
a widely dispersed area where they lived. Owning horses, they
could fulfill the demand for the transportation of materials and
goods. Also, the largest recorded luhbur consisted of 5,000 men.
If one permits an additional 5,000 men participating in other
luhburs at the same time, the total remaining is 15,000. Luhburs
also lasted for only a few months at the most. This means that
during a year about 15,000 Pindaris remained ln central India for
the whole year, while all of the Pindaris lived in central India
for six to nine months of the year. Malcolm was also amazed at
the prosperity and orderliness of Sutwas, one of the main Pindari
headquarters. Though reports outside central India indicate the
destruction the Pindaris caused there, they evidently maintained
order and contributed to the economy Or the places they lived.

This repudiates a notion held by F.D. Drewitt in his <i><b>Bombay in
the Days of George IV </b></i>(London: 1907), p. 113 that women and
children went along on the luhbur. It is possible that women were
along during the Maratha Period of Pindari history, when the
Pindaris had no permanent homes and were attached to an army. The
women probably went along with tents and baggage and stayed with
the army while the Pindaris went out raiding, but in the
Independent Period women could not have accompanied the luhburs
which went so fast because they traveled so lightly.  Malcolm (in
<i><b>Central India</b></i>, II, p. 177-78) makes a very confusing reference to
women. In a footnote he tells of the god which women invoked
while their husbands were away on expeditions, while in the
following sentences he says the women were hardy and masculine
from accompanying their husbands on excursions. Wither excursions
and expeditions mean two different things or only one of these
contradictory statements is true. From all other descriptions of
the luhburs, there id no mention of Pindari women on luhburs.

the British in the Pindari war. While he was staying with a
fakir, some Pindaris came and asked the fakir freely about where
the British or other Pindaris were. East India Company, Papers,
p. 56 mentions that beggars and fakirs informed the Pindaris in t
heir 1816 raid on the Madras Presidency.

through and, therefore, that he cannot be blamed.

<pre>
     There are two types of general histories on the Pindaris
which are most useful for a general survey. First, there are the
histories written at the time of the Pindaris by people connected
in some way with them. Malcolm's <i><b>Central India</b></i> is the most useful
book in this respect, but Grant Duff, Prinsep, and Fitzclarence
are also helpful. Grant Duff wrote from his political and
military experience with the Marathas; Prinsep from his
experience as a secretary in Calcutta; and Fitzclarence from his
travels and study of the Indian situation. Second, are the
histories written after the time of the Pindaris by those who had
no direct connection with them. Wilson, Mehta, Ross, and Thompson
are the best of this type and in that order. <p>
     For the etymology of the Pindaris, Yule and Burnell contains
all of the etymologies so far discovered. Prinsep and Wilson's
<i><b>Glossary </b></i>have devised etymologies which are within Yule and
Burnell's book. <p>
     For the earliest references to any type of group, such as
the Pindaris, Kautilya and Brihaspati (<i><b>Sacred Books of the East</b></i>)
have been looked at and compared with S.N. Sen's quotes (See
<a href="#fn04">footnote No. 4</a>). <p>
     For the Muslim Period, Firishta's <i><b>History </b></i>and Manucci
provide the only original information. S.N. Sen (for military
aspects), Malcolm, Grant Duff and Sardesai are the best sources
for the Maratha Period. <p>
     Malcolm is the best overall summary of the Independent<p>

<h5>++ Page 76</h5>

Period, but an interview with a captured Pindari in Sinha, the
Sydenham and Jenkins reports in the <i><b>Parliamentary Papers</b></i>,
Sandeman, and Prinsep provide important expansion, explanation,
and confirmation of Malcolm's contentions. <p>
     For raids on British Territory, the investigation by the
Commission at Cumbum contained in the East India Company's
<i><b>Papers</b></i>, reports and letters in the <i><b>Parliamentary Papers</b></i>, and some
in Sandeman and Sinha provide good on-the-spot reports and
opinions of Just how the Pindaris operated. <p>
     For British policy and opinion, Ross, Mehta, Wilson, and
Hastings' <i><b>Diary</b></i> are the best references. Blacker gives the
fullest account of the war, while Prinsep and Wilson give shorter
accounts, and Sitaram gives an interesting account from the
soldier's point of view. <p>
     Malcolm again (both in the <i><b>P.P</b></i>. and <i><b>Central India</b></i>) is the
best source after the war, and Nevill for 100 years later. 
     The rest of the books provide spotty and only single,
special references. <p>
     I have only listed the books I have used; not all the books
which I found touched on the subject of the Pindaris in this
period. <p>
