In this analysis of colonial attempts to control and manage the agrarian region surrounding the Kosi River,
Hill argues that colonial ecological, political, and social policies were inextricably intertwined. The colonial
administrators set about "improving" India’s physical environment, just as they "improved" its social and
political climate. In so doing, they were ill-prepared to understand, let alone administer, a river such as the
Kosi—which traced a violent and erratic course out of the Himalayas, "carrying thousands of tons of silty
sand and destroying everything in its path." The ecological paternalism imposed by the colonial governors
introduced social and revenue policies that were to have a profound effect on the peasantry that continues
to this day.<p>
