<center><h2>Warts and all, Indian elections are more meaningful than those in
most democracies.</h2></center>

Time has not dimmed the vivid images of the remarkable political
activism whose history I began studying four decades ago. Over
the years that inquiry has taken me primarily to Gangetic north
India and, more specifically, Bihar. In the past dozen years my
interest in the politics of peasant activism has come to include
an interest in the structural links between the history and
electoral politics of the Thirties and Forties and that of the
contemporary present.<p>


     This has provided a rich opportunity to interact with and
learn from the people of the cities, towns, and villages who are
the central players in these and all elections. As also from the
candidates who seek their votes, and from the administrators, the
election officials and the returning officers who mobilise this
unique exercise in democracy. <p>

     In anticipation of the Bihar polls I travelled recently from
Ranchi in Chhotanagpur to Patna, Barh, Nalanda and Munger in
central Bihar, to Hajipur, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Madhubani and
Purnea, north of the Ganga. <p>

     As each time before, whether Lok Sabha or assembly
elections, the encounter has been revealing. The cliche that it
has to be seen to be believed is entirely apt here. A
parliamentary election in India is by definition the largest
democratic electoral exercise ever to be undertaken, any time,
any place. The sheer numbers involved and the logistics of
mobilising an open democratic election with an adult franchise
approximating 590 million eligible voters are staggering. This is
more eligible voters than the population of all but two countries
on the planet. <p>

     More than 800,000 polling stations will serve this
electorate, 200,000 more than were set up for 1991 elections. In
Bihar the number of polling stations is up from about 64,000 in
1991 to 82,828 in 1996, the electorate up from 50.45 million to
58.4 million. The national electorate is up 80 million over the
1991 figure. The goal is to have less than 1,000 voters per
polling place, and ideally never to go above 1,200 so that HO
voter need walk more than two kilometers to his or her polling
place.<p> 

     Equally remarkable as these numbers and what they mean in
terms of organising so massive a public event, is the extent of
voter participation and what this means as an expression of the
will of the people. In Bihar, in the last three general
elections, voter turnout has been at or slightly above 60 per
cent. In 1977 it reached nearly 61 per cent.<p>


     Equally significant and revealing is the consistent increase
in voter participation and presumably, therefore, voter
awareness. Between 1952 and 1962 the turnout in Bihar went up
from 40.5 per cent to 47 per cent. It reached 51.5 per cent in
1967, remaining roughly at that level in 1971. It retained in
1980 and the three most recent elections the level achieved with
the upward movement to the 60 per cent mark in 1977.<p>


     Also important in these calculations is that there has been
relatively little or no fall off in these Lok Sabha figures in
voter participation in assembly elections, citing here also the
case of Bihar. In the 11 assembly elections between 1952 and
1995, the voter turnout was below 50 per cent only in 1957 and
1962. It reached the 60 per cent level or better in both the 1990
and 1995 elections.<p>


     In comparison the United States has seen a significant fall
off in voter participation between national, especially
presidential, elections and state elections. In any event, voter
participation in the US seldom reaches over 50 per cent. State
elections often attract voter participation in percentages as low
as the forties or thirties.<p>


     There is also a difference in the aggressive registration of
all eligible voters over 18 in India as compared to the
voluntary, and therefore less than total, registration of voters
in the US. In the 1992 US presidential elections there were only
133.8 million names on the rolls.<p>


     This figure is meant to place the Indian experience of voter
participation in the perspective of democratic electoral politics
worldwide. By that standard India's voter turnout of between 50
per cent and 60 per cent and above is certainly among the
highest, barring those few polities where voting is mandated by
law. And those percentages of voter turnout have been more than
maintained in the first round of voting in the current Lok Sabha
and assembly elections, anxieties about the effect of campaign
restrictions imposed by the model code of conduct
notwithstanding.<p>


<center><img src="voters.gif"></center>
     Preliminary figures show a moderate 60 per cent of voters
casting their ballot in the 10 states and four union territories
which voted on April 27, varying from a low of 50 per cent in
Delhi and Rajasthan to a high of 90 per cent in Lakshwadeep, but
running in most states in the range of 55 per cent to 70 per
cent. Politicians and election officials in most countries of the
world would be incredulous at the report that at 65 per cent
Kerala registered the lowest turnout in its electoral history.<p>

          Press reports indicate that violence was "marginal".
That in those sensitive areas where problems were most expected,
polling was generally peaceful and voter participation good. The
latest reports have the Election Commission undertaking repolling
in 446 polling booths including all the 129 booths in an Assam
assembly constituency where misprinted ballots were used. This
means that there is repolling in 317 out of the 203,705 polling
stations which voted on April 27, as a result of captured booths,
intimidation of voters and polling staff, and so on.<p>


     Even assuming wide underreporting of such episodes, the
numbers are nevertheless insignificant in the overall. There was
prompt identification of these 317 polling places where
manipulation occurred, many of the perpetrators were arrested and
immediate repolling under heavy security scheduled. All this
suggests the EC is exercising its constitutional mandate of
implementing a free and fair election within the human limits so
massive an undertaking in so complex a social and political
environment imposes. In other words, in a significant measure the
votes cast in this election, for and against candidates and
parties, as in previous elections, do indeed represent the
democratic will of the Indian people.<p>


     It must be said the EC in its efforts to regulate and reform
the system is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't.
Previous commissions, though committed to reform, were condemned
for their failure to move more expeditiously in these efforts.
The current EC, aggressively determined to enforce election laws
and the model code of conduct, is criticised for being
overzealous, overspending in implementing its watchdog functions.
Also, by restricting visual and oral representations in the
campaign especially posters, banners, wall paintings, and loud
speakers-it is accused of having in effect produced a lacklustre
campaign and limited the flow of information to the voters.<p>


     The voter turnout in the first phase of voting and my brief
initial election foray into Bihar suggests that voters,
candidates and returning officers by and large feel differently.
We now know the model code of conduct has not diminished voter
turnout. And the consensus among candidates and party workers in
Bihar to whom I spoke is that the effects of the model code have
been salutary. <p>

     The close regulation of campaign expenditures, the limits on
visual and sound representations, have obliged candidates to move
personally far more widely in their constituencies and among the
voters. One observer noted there was less vulgar competition in
outdoing the next candidate and party in more and better posters
and banners. It may all be less colourful and festive but the
general sense is that it is less costly and has produced a
healthier election environment. <p>

     There will be exceptions` and qualifications to these
assessments, especially from candidates and parties not likely to
win. They will charge that the process, however positive, is
still controlled by the party and government in power.  In fact,
historically, incumbent parties lose elections and therefore
power, despite the administration and management of a given
election being in their hands. <p>


     As an American I will add that if these efforts at limiting
campaign expenditures and the model code serve to control the
spread of television campaigning and the 30 second sound
bite-both of which are major problems in US electoral
politics-the EC will by definition have benefitted the Indian
electoral process to everyone's advantage. <p>

     These observations are not unqualified and uncritical praise
of electoral politics in India I know the meaning of poll
violence and booth capturing. And having concerned myself with
peasant activism as a historical phenomenon, I also understand
the many forms of intimidation in rural India and rural Bihar.
But all the irregularities notwithstanding, and in the overall
they are limited, I maintain that the final result, when all
ballots are counted, does represent the will of the people. <p>

     In the 1984 parliamentary elections there was a provision
that if a candidate got more than 90 per cent of the vote in a
given polling booth, that result was suggestive of manipulation
and would be included only if the results in the constituency as
a whole were affected. Based on boothwise results for one of my
sample parliamentary constituencies, I systematically deleted all
votes where candidates had received 90 per cent of the votes in a
polling booth, and did this for all booths in the constituency. <p>

     The results remained the same, that is the winning, second,
and third place finishers were identical by virtually the
identical percentages as if the full vote had been included. I
should add a caveat here that 90 per cent of the votes for a
given candidate in any polling booth in India, or precinct in the
US, does not inevitably imply rigging. It depends entirely on the
nature of the polling site and the voters there. <p>

     Indian voters know far more about their social, economic,
and political interests than some cynical urban observers give
them credit for.  The world Bank definitions of literacy and
illiteracy are not terms in my explanatory lexicon of life in
rural India. Peasants do not need to read an English language
newspaper to cast an informed and intelligent ballot. They
produced the food and provided the political constituency which
achieved freedom in 1947. They play an equally critical role in
the political process in 1996. They are the backbone of the
dynamic democratic polity that is India in the late 20th century.
It is a democratic polity that may be flawed, but I know of none
that is not.<p>
