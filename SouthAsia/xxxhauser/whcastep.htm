    THESE brief reflections on caste and politics in Bihar are
meant to reinforce the recent and particularly sensitive
observations of Ashis Nandy and Dipankar Gupta on the meaning of
caste in the social and political calculus of late 20th century
India. I will do this by appealing to a remembered past, of
conversations with Shri Krishna Singh, Rajendra Prasad,
Jayaprakash Narayan, and Karpoori Thakur, each of whom in their
own ways were prominent players in the history of Bihar and of
India in this century. It is a history which can only serve to
illuminate the present, hopefully to give it a broader and deeper
meaning than the accepted wisdom images of the moment. Or so at
least the historian likes to think.<p>
    
     Those meanings imply almost as a given that in matters of
caste and politics, which by definition express relationships of
hierarchy, status, and power, we are treading on contested
terrain. This is as true in our images and perceptions of the
past as it is in the experience of the present. There are in
effect many pasts just as there are many presents, inevitably
depending on who is making the observation. This is another way
of saying that there is no absolute truth in the gloss which
appears on these pages or any other. Indeed, it is the very
ambiguity of image and perception which makes these issues of
status and power worthy of debate in our efforts at understanding
the phenomenon. And it is precisely these ambiguities and the
permutations we employ in defining our individual and collective
goals and identities which give to the political experience of
India, or any true democracy, its fascination and richness in
1997.<p>
    
     Before turning to that past I will draw briefly on the 1996
observations of Gupta and Nandy as points of departure. 
Referring specifically to electoral politics,  Gupta tells us
that 'caste alliances appear to emanate from secular and
political factors and do not spring full-blown from primordial
loyalties.... What brings about such horizontal solidarities
between castes, is the extent to which their secular interests
coincide, which in turn depends on their structural location in
society....  If anything, caste alliances are shorthand ways of
signalling a coalescence of secular interests. What needs to be
appreciated is that these interests must really be powerful
enough for castes to overcome their natural repulsion towards
each other (in order to) form united fronts.' 
<a name="bk01"></a><a href="#fn01">[1]</a><p>
    
     What this means in practical terms in the 1990s, Ashis Nandy
argues, is that the political and economic growth of the middle
and lower castes has changed 'polities beyond recognition.' Nandy
is cited in the <i><b>New York Times</b></i> recently as observing that 'caste
is now a principal of political mobilization rather than a matter
of ritual distance.' <a name="bk02"></a><a href="#fn02">[2]</a> 
Indeed it is a process that has been at
work for many of the years since Independence in 1947, and one
might argue, as I do here, that the transition from the late 19th
and early 20th century politics of culture, in fact began with
the Council and Assembly elections of the 1920s and 1930s.  It is
a process obviously in constant flux and change.<p>
    
     This suggests that in this context, caste is neither unique,
as the popular western press sometimes has it, nor is it static, 
unchangeable, and immutable as is also often assumed. It is
rather the fluid and mutable qualities of caste, or more
accurately <i>jati</i>, that make it one of the vital and dynamic
identity markers of Indian society and politics in 1997. To
assume otherwise in a cultural setting in which the idea of
<i>sanskar</i> is a central element of the very being of vast numbers of
Indians individually and collectively, is to effectively deny one
of the core elements of what it means to be Indian. 
<a name="bk03"></a><a href="#fn03">[3]</a> <p>
    
     The point is not that caste is the sole identity marker in
Indian polities, but precisely the opposite: it relates to and
interacts with many different kinds of identity interests -
religious, sectarian, ethnic, racial, agrarian, class, and I
would add personality. and that it is these various combinations
and re-combinations, which over time define the Indian social and 
political experience. If one looks at the world of politics
beyond India, it would not be difficult to argue that this is not
simply an Indian but a human phenomenon: witness the most recent
evidence from eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, central
Africa, the Middle East, or as I will suggest at conclusion
of these remarks, the United States.<p>
    
     Swami  Sahajanand Saraswati, writing in 1940 about the
Provincial Council elections of late 1926, and the Legislative
Assembly elections of early 1937 in Bihar, commented on the role
of caste and factionalism in the polities of those decades in
terms that appear entirely familiar today. He writes 'that there
is very little difference between nationalism and casteism, and
it is a difference which disappears at a certain stage....  The
only real difference is that caste covers a relatively smaller
field whereas nationalism functions in a wider arena.' 
<a name="bk04"></a><a href="#fn04">[4]</a> <p>

    
     I cite Sahajanand here both as a comment on his prescient
sensibilities about caste and politics in India then and now, but
primarily because he, in his own career and in his participation
in the cultural politics and freedom movement politics of the
1920s and '30s, symbolizes the qualitative transition occurring
in that politics. While that transition may have been gradual
between then and now, it is nevertheless true that the political
and social alliances which were to emerge full-blown in an
environment of universal adult suffrage after 1947, were already
apparent in the cultural and colonial electoral experience of the
1920s and 1930s.<p>
    
     The cultural politics obviously took many forms in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. But for the upper castes, now
denominated forward castes. the caste sabha or caste association
was one of the most common. And here the issues of 'natural
repulsion', and 'ritual distance' among and between castes as
described by Gupta and Nandy were very much at work. Put in its
simplest terms. these caste associations were designed to define
and articulate status identity and ritual distance by utilizing
Indian cultural categories.  Notwithstanding the Indianness of
the phenomenon, as its elaborate vernacular literature testifies, 
it was at the same time concerned with defining its role visa-vis
the colonial state, most often in terms of a loyalist political
posture in the emerging Constitutional environment of the
early decades of this century. 
<a name="bk05"></a><a href="#fn05">[5]</a>  I would argue that the 1910s
and 1920s were the high water-mark of the phenomenon and that
1929 might well be taken as the turning point to what was to
become the politics of democratic mobilization.<p>
    
++ Page 49<p>


     Sahajanand's role in this political history effectively
began in December 1914 with his active involvement in the social
reform movement of the Bhumihar Brahman Mahasabha. Indeed, for
eleven years he was its chief protagonist. The issues were
essentially those of self respect and status recognition of
Bhumihars as true Brahmans in the eyes of the wider Brahman world
of eastern U.P. and Bihar. <a name="bk06"></a><a href="#fn06">[6]</a>  
But Sahajanand's political
horizon was far broader than that of caste and status among
Bhumihar Brahmans.<p>

     That politics (of culture) would Soon overlap with his
activism as a Gandhian Congressman from 1920, including
membership in the All Indian Congress Committee and then the
Working Committee of the Bihar Provincial Congress Committee. By 
1926 those overlapping interests came into conflict when
Sahajanand prevailed in having a nationalist Congressman named as
president of the Mahasabha at its Patna session. This conflict
finally resulted in the dissolution of the Bhumihar Mahasabha at
its Monghyr session in the summer of 1929 when Sahajanand refused
to accept as president of the Sabha the loyalist Sir Ganesh Dutt
Singh. He was Minister for Local Self Government of Bihar and
Orissa, one of the major public figures of the province and
arguably the most influential protagonist of Bhumihar interests 
in the province, if not in all of Gangetic north India. 
<a name="bk07"></a><a href="#fn07">[7]</a> <p>
    
     It is perhaps not surprising therefore that Shri Krishna
Singh, himself a leading Congressman of Monghyr and the chairman
of the Reception Committee attempted to avoid the break with Sir
Ganesh which Sahajanand precipitated at the 1929 Bhumihar Sabha
meeting in  Monghyr. This despite the fact that Sir Ganesh had
opposed Shri Krishna Singh and other Swaraj Party members on
numerous policy issues in the Legislative Council. The irony of
this politics is that it was in the same year that the Bihar
Provincial Kisan Sabha was formed, at the behest of number of
prominent Swaraj Party activists and Congressmen, in order to
repel the efforts of government to introduce an amendment to the
Bihar Tenancy Act, considered to be seriously unfavourable to the
peasant tenants of the province.<p>
    
     The venue for this founding meeting of the Kisan Sabha was
the popular Sonepur Mela in Saran, the home district of Rajendra
Prasad and of Jayaprakash Narayan, later to be active in the
Kisan Sabha, the Congress. and of course the Congress Socialist
Party. Shri Krishna Singh was named General Secretary. 
Sahajanand was proposed as president, but he demurred, suggesting
instead the name of Rajendra Prasad, already at that time the 
most prominent Congress activist in Bihar. History records that
Sahajanand finally did accept the nomination as president,
proffered insistently by leading Congressmen of the province.
This was clearly Sahajanand the moderate activist at work within
the Gandhian framework of Congress agrarian reform.<p>
    
     The economic and political clouds then already on the
horizon would see a shift on Sahajanand's part to a militant 
class based kisan activism, and in 1934 and 1938 serious splits
with the Congress both as organization and as government. 
<a name="bk08"></a><a href="#fn08">[8]</a> But
in the 1920s and specifically in 1929, Sahajanand and many other
Congressmen had started moving away from a cultural politics
defined in terms of sectarian and caste sabha interests.<p>
    
     There were of course other events to mark this 1929
transition to a new and more open-end politics, not the least of
which was the Lahore session of the Congress in December of that
year. Sahajanand, a member of the AICC at the time, noted that
the zeal and enthusiasm at Lahore was almost beyond description.
'When the resolution on full and complete Independence was
passed, it seemed as though a new world had come into being.' 
<a name="bk09"></a><a href="#fn09">[9]</a> 
But as Rajendra Prasad and Sahajanand would reveal, this did not
mean that caste and jati were no longer factors in the body
politic, but rather that they would be employed in new and more
complex ways as instruments of cross cutting political
mobilization. As we know, this was a significant factor in the
electoral politics of nationalism before 1947, just as it would
be in the democratic electoral environment of a free India.<p>
   
     These images were only vaguely apparent in April 1959, when,
as a post<p>

graduate research student. I met Shri Krishna Singh at the chief
minister's residence in Patna. I had spent much of the preceding
year working in the State Central Records Office examining the
historical record of Congress and Kisan Sabha activism in the
1920s and '30s. I knew that  Shri Babu had been one of the main
players in Bihar politics and from 1937, the Congress chief
minister. His insight and remarkable recall of the events of two
and three decades before was no surprise. It  was only later,
when I returned to the State Archives. that I learned that Shri
Babu had in fact requisitioned some of the very files I had been
consulting to refresh himself in preparation for our meeting. 
This struck me then as it does now as a remarkably sensitive act
of political and intellectual generosity. It also served to
reaffirm for me, the substance of what Shri Babu had revealed in
our interview.<p>
    
     At this distance in time. several things stand out about
that 1959 encounter. Shri Babu's respect for Sahajanand, for his
integrity, his commitment to the nation, and his determination on
behalf of the peasants of Bihar. For Shri Babu, Sahajanand's
commitment and determination took two forms. First, in his
nationalist efforts at the 1929 Monghyr Bhumihar Mahasabha, and
second, that despite all differences with the Congress, it was
Sahajanand's militant peasant activism in the 1930s which
ultimately created the political climate that made zamindari
abolition  possible in the years after Independence.  I should
note here that barring the war years, Shri Babu was chief
minister of Bihar from the time of the first Congress Ministry in
1937 until his death in 1961.<p>
    
     The respect the major Congress players in Bihar had for one
another whatever their political differences, is important in
assessing what they were saying to me in 1959 and after. Also
what this tells us about the politics of the 1930s and the 1990s. 
I say this because Sahajanand in his 1940 reflection on these
events was brutally frank about the politics of the '20s and
'30s, and none of my informants - whether Shri Babu, Rajendra
Prasad, Jayaprakash, or Karpoori Thakur - took issue with
Sahajanand's argument while always conceding his candour.<p>

    
     For example, I refer to Sahajanand's comments on the 1926
Council elections: 'I can never forget the highly improper
behaviour I witnessed at the time of that  election. Among other
things, factionalism of the most blatant kind characterized all
party politics. Even the most prominent Congress leaders were
talking and mobilizing themselves in terms of caste.  This could
not have been done openly but that it was happening quietly and
behind closed doors was apparent to all. Based on my experiences
not only of that election, but of all other elections since, I
must say with due apologies for this apparent impudence, that
most nationalist leaders of Bihar are fundamentally casteist."
<a name="bk10"></a><a href="#fn10">[10]</a> <p>
    
     Observing the 1936 ticket allocation process by the
Provincial Working Committee, Sahajanand writes even more
pointedly: 'There seemed to be no basis or principle on which
candidates were being nominated. At some places faithful Congress
workers who had suffered severe loss in the movement and had been
imprisoned were left out and in their place big zamindars and
their friends who had neither been imprisoned nor wore khaddar
until yesterday were nominated.   At other places persons who
were well known among the kisans for their oppressions were
offered Congress tickets. And there was wide reliance on
groupism,  casteism, personal relationships and friendships in
naming candidates. I had never seen such manoeuvering and
manipulation. I was amazed. I wondered to myself whether these
were the people  who would set the country free and who called
themselves nationalists?' 
<a name="bk11"></a><a href="#fn11">[11]</a>  It is following this reflection
in his memoirs that Sahajanand observes that there is little
difference between casteism and nationalism, and that it was a
difference which would in fact gradually disappear.<p>
    
     In August 1959, at the conclusion of a two year period of 
research and on  the eve of my departure from India, I was
privileged to meet Dr. Rajendra Prasad at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
There I heard a remarkably similar, if more measured and
qualified report on the same election.  I was given fifteen
minutes to pay my  respects to the President, though my interest
was of course in knowing more about his role in the freedom
movement  and more specifically in the political history of
Bihar. Rajen Babu determined my interest with his very first
question. The fifteen minutes soon became ninety as he responded
at length to all of my queries.  Rajendra Prasad was equally a
man of  candour and while less critically pointed than Sahajanand
on the events of 1936,   made many of the same points.<p>
    
     He had made these a matter of public record in his
<i><b>Autobiography </b></i>less than two years before our meeting. For
example:  'Another peculiar feature of the nominations were
considerations of caste. The Congress abhorred the idea but local 
circumstances compelled it to submit to it. It is a matter of
shame that in Bihar, the PCC had to take caste labels into
account in certain constituencies because the success of
candidates there depended on such considerations. Further, we had
to give adequate representation to all prominent castes. It is
disgraceful for an organization like the Congress to do so but
success in the elections was our first objective and secondly, it
should not be overlooked that the Congress is a widespread
organization consisting of people of all castes. The fact,
however, remains that though from the point of view of practical
politics our nominations proved a great success, we ought not to
have even thought in terms of class or caste distinctions.' 
<a name="bk12"></a><a href="#fn12">[12]</a> <p>
    
     While the President was warm in his praise for Sahajanand as
a patriot and spokesman for the kisans and while in his
<i><b>Autobiography</b></i> he had conceded the differences that surfaced
between them in  nominating candidates, he said little about the
split that emerged once the Congress ministry assumed office. 
For our purposes the issue is not that Sahajanand and the Kisan
Sabha campaigned<p>

++ Page 51<p>

campaigned vigorously on behalf of the Congress, or that there
was ultimately a break between them, but that caste was a key
element in mobilizing support in that election in Bihar as it was
elsewhere. It might also be noted that while Sahajanand shared
Rajendra Prasad's anxieties at what was happening, he too
recognized this reality. Commenting on the group rivalries among
Rajputs, Kayasthas,  Bhumihars, and Maithils, Sahajanand notes
that 'these factional rivalries, though they function below the
surface, are nevertheless exceedingly intense. All of this is a
great misfortune for us, for our province, and for the nation.
But these are the realities and no honest person can deny it if
he is at all familiar with the inner workings of the system, even
though casual observation from the  outside makes it difficult to
cite specific examples.' <a name="bk13"></a><a href="#fn13">[13]</a> <p>
    
     But we cannot thereby presume that only high caste players,
whether  Bhumihar Brahmans, Rajputs, Kayasthas, or Maithil
Brahmans were active in the politics of freedom or the politics
of caste identity which preceded it and overlapped with it. 
Rather, we need to be aware of a more inclusive and deeper
history which was equally important at the time and would come to
dominate Bihar politics and much of Indian politics in the later
decades of the century. Commenting on the politics of culture
defined by the middle cultivating castes of eastern U.P. and
Bihar in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the historian
William Pinch observes that 'the shift from the cultural politics
of the early 20th century to the political culture of the 1990s
is not one that occurred as a sharp break at Independence in 1947
but has been much more gradual, indeed almost imperceptible. The
implications of that shift are profound, signaling the demise of
a political culture based on an ideology of martial power and the
rise of politics based on democratic,  demographic realities.'
<a name="bk14"></a><a href="#fn14">[14]</a> <p>
    
     Pinch goes on to note that the distinctions between these
colonial and post-colonial realities had to do with achieving an
identifiable measure of social and economic justice in a free
India. 'For Kurmi, Yadav, and Kushvaha leaders, this would
represent a sea-change in Indian political culture, since (the)
Kshatriya identity (to which they had aspired) only had meaning
in the context of a colonial political system crafted around
visions of martial grandeur. In independent India politics would
be predicated instead on universal adult suffrage and a
commitment to the welfare of the nation's citizenry and would be
played out by Indian party  politicians seeking Indian votes.'
<a name="bk15"></a><a href="#fn15">[15]</a> <p>
    
     As we know the way in which these groups came to define
themselves in the social democracy of a free India was through
mechanisms expressed in terms of  backward class interests,
reservations, and the Mandal phenomenon with which we are all
familiar. It is precisely this set of issues and the process by
which they have surfaced to which Ashis Nandy refers.<p>    

     I will cite two brief vignettes from 1978 and 1979 to show
that by the end of that decade the emerging political and
economic influence of the middle and lower castes was indeed
beginning to change 'politics beyond recognition,' to use Nandy's
apt phrase. It was December 31, 1978, new year's eve in Patna. A
mutual friend asked if I wished to join him in paying our
respects to the ailing Jayaprakash.  We proceeded to JP's
residence in Kadamkuan and though he was unwell and heavily
wrapped against the winter cold, he was in a reflective mood.  He
and I had first met at his Shekhodeora Ashram in Gaya in
1958,more regularly in Patna between 1963 and 1965 discussing his
Socialist and Kisan Sabha activism of the '30s and only
occasionally thereafter. But this reflection turned to mild
agitation when I raised questions about the reservations policy
being pursued by the then Chief Minister, Karpoori Thakur. 'He is
moving too fast. These things will all come in good time. We
Socialists have been pushing these social interests for many
years, and will continue to do so.'  But the days when a backward
caste political leader would accept that logic, even from the
venerable and respected Jayaprakash were past, as Karpoori made
pointedly clear when I met him later that night. This was a new
and different day in the political history of Bihar and of
India.' <a name="bk16"></a><a href="#fn16">[16]</a> <p>
    
     Karpoori too was agitated at the claim made in the cover
story of a bi-weekly newsmagazine that 'Bihar Is Burning'.  My
travels in Bihar had shown me that it was not, which Karpoori
also knew and asserted. And he spoke with confidence, not because
he was from the numerically small nai or barber caste but because
he was a man of impeccable integrity. He spoke for and on behalf
of the majority backward and scheduled caste population of the
state by the force of his personality and by his commitment to a
day of equity and justice for the marginal poor.  Karpoori Thakur
was succeeded briefly in 1979 by a scheduled caste chief minister
from his own Janata Party, and then by a succession of five
Congress chief ministers, all Brahmans and Rajputs. The current
incumbent, Laloo Prasad Yadav is now completing his seventh year
in office. In terms of longevity. this makes him second only to
the first Chief Minister, Shri Krishna Singh.<p>
    
     We may infer from this fact and this history that politics
has indeed changed<p>
    
++ Page 52<p>

beyond recognition in India and Bihar.  But we must also note
that these changes have not emerged from a changeless past but
rather one that has been culturally and socially interactive for
many years and political generations. We may also infer that the
appeal to justice, equity, and self respect of the backward and
depressed sectors of society, which Laloo Yadav has employed so
effectively to sustain his populist agenda, is not new. Those 
appeals too have a history and notable spokesmen. That makes
their representations in the 1990s by Laloo Yadav no less
important or meaningful, but places them in the larger history of
social experience of which they are a part.<p>
    
     It is that history and the images and perceptions of the
major players and the people themselves with which I have been
concerned in these reflections. It is a history which has served
the identity interests not only of social, cultural, and
political activists in this century, but of the people, the
peasants and the villagers who were and remain to a very
significant degree the primary constituents of that history and
of the present to which we  have now come. It is this reality,
Ashis Nandy reminds us, which has receded in the mind's eye of
most urban Indians.  'Our vision of India no longer involves the
imagination of a village. The village for us now is primarily a
place where strange people live, where sati and untouchability
are practiced, where Hindu-Muslims riots have been taking place
for centuries, where the inhabitants continue to pursue the
sports of homicide and robbery.' <a name="bk17"></a><a href="#fn17">[17]</a> <p>
    
     The reality of which I write is not meant to romanticize
caste as an element of political mobilization in Bihar and   
India, nor to identify what might be perceived as its invidious
influences. The  effort has been rather to recognize the presence
of caste and jati as active and dynamic elements in the cultural
and  political lives of the citizens of the state and nation. We
have been concerned with the forms and transitions of these
identity markers over time and the ways in which they have
influenced social and political experience in this century.<p>

     I began this essay as I conclude it, by suggesting that
issues of social and cultural identity take many different forms
in the human experience and that among these caste is one. Race
and ethnicity, as we in the United States know well, are others.  
That issues of affirmative action and immigration were central to
the political debate in 1996, as they are to the judicial process
in 1997, makes this point well. And while the term sanskar is not
widely known in the American lexicon of social experience, we do
presume in our more reflective moments that 'blood is thicker
than water.' This permits me to say as I did at the outset of
this essay that it is not entirely accurate to suggest that caste
is uniquely Indian. Indeed, we think what we believe about our
respective identities, our own and those of our neighbours with
whom we share the same social and cultural space.<p>
    
And it is the politicizing of that process with which I have been
concerned.  The inevitable question of course is where do we go
from here, what processes of change are now at work, what is the
transitional stage in which we now find ourselves? Or put another
way, are the scams and corruptions of Patna, Delhi, or
Washington, and the judicial activism which they have generated,
emerging though not fully understood reflections of the
transitions in which we are presently involved? For the historian
these questions must remain no more than questions.  There are, 
however, two certainties in the democracies that are the United
States and India. First, that government and politicians, and
some would say the press, are under a large cloud of suspicion. 
And second, as H.L. Mencken reminded us, the cure for the ills of
democracy is more democracy. It is after all true that whether
their names are Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, or H. D. Deve
Gowda, Laloo Prasad Yadav, or Sitaram Kesri, their place and
position is held at the will of the people.   It is their image
of equity and justice which will ultimately be served.<p>

intellectual sense of sacrament or ritual but rather as a kind of
shorthand for the lived social and cultural experience of those
Indians whose roots are grounded in the village atmosphere of
their birth or their ancestors.  In this sense it has to do with
the values, beliefs, and practices across all caste boundaries
whether Brahman, Yadav, or Chamar, as example.  The definition
which conveys these meanings most explicitly is that appearing in
the <i><b>Meenakshi Hindi-English Dictionary</b></i> (new Delhi: Meenakshi
Prakashan, 1980), p. 692: 'cultural) tradition, which becomes
part of one's being.' My point clearly is not to essentialize the
concept and practice of caste and jati, but as I imply throughout
this essay, precisely the opposite.

before the reflections of the political scientist Benedict

reflection of the prominent presence of dominant land controllers
and urban professionals in the cast sabhas.  These memberships of
course varied from one sabha to another, as for example between
the Bhumihar Brahman Mahasabha or the Kayastha Sabha, another of
the early caste associations in Gangetic North India.  But the
presence of Sri Ganesh Dutt Singh in the bhumihar Sabha and
Sachchidananda Sinha in the Kayastha Sabha makes my point nicely. 
I use the case of the Bhumihar Sabha in what follows to show what
this membership and these policies meant in the political context
of colonialism and nationalism.

vows of <i>sannyas</i> in 1907 at the Aparnath Math in Kashi and assumed
the <i>dand </i>in 1911.  His family background was that of the
Jujhautiya Brahmans who in the Ghazipur village of his birth in
1889. had both commensal and marriage relations with the more
numerous Bhumihar Brahmans of the area. I touch on the specifics
of this history in 'Swami Sahajanand and the Politics of Social 
Reform, 1907-195', <i><b>The Indian Historical Review</b></i> 18: 1-2
(1991-1992), pp. 59-75. For a Hindi translation of this essay see
Itihas 3 ( 1994), pp. 143-162.

<a name="fn07"></a>7. There is a substantial literature on the caste association
phenomenon which fall well beyond the scope of this reflective
essay.  However, Sahajanand's view from the inside so to speak,
provides a compelling comment on the changing nature of caste and
politics in 20th century India.  He writes that 'caste sabhas
were originally set up to present welcome addresses to officials
of government and to pass resolutions of loyalty to the Raj.  In
fact what was happening is that the more clever  among the
wealthy were serving their self interest by making these appeals
of loyally and doing so in the name of particular castes. But
with  the changes which were taking place in the country this
became less and less possible, and these people then sought to
gain votes and electoral support through the caste associations. 
It is personally gratifying that I have been able to end both
these practices through my involvement with the Bhumihar Brahman
Sabha.  It was at Monghyr in the summer of 1929, that the
possibility of using the Sabha in these ways was given a final
burial.' <i><b>Mera Jivan Sangharsh</b></i>, p. 302.
 <b><a href="#bk07">Back</a></b><p>
    
<a name="fn08"></a>8. Sahajanand's transformation to an explicit commitment to
peasants and the poor of all castes is graphical reflected in his
rhetorical query, 'Where is the God of the poor? I will give my
life serving the poor. Apart from them there is no other God in
my heart.  They are my God!' <i><b>Mera Jivan Sangharsh</b></i>, p. 429.  For
his more extended examination of these issues see Sahajanand's
<i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i>, especially Chapter 3.  This text is available in
the original Hindi and in my edited translation in <i><b>Sahajanand on
Agricultural Labour and the Rural Poor </b></i>(New Delhi: Manohar
Publishers, 1994), esp. pp. 72-89.

comments on this transitional phase of the politics of caste
identity, especially as it relates to the middle cultivating
castes, and the earlier chapters for the history of these
identity movements.  For more specific elaboration of one aspect
of that history see Pinch's recent essay, 'Reinventing Ramanand:
Caste and History in Gangetic India,' <i><b>Modern Asian Studies</b></i> 30:3
(1996), pp. 549-571.  It is useful to note that when Sahajanand
refers to political factors in the 1920s and 30s he factors in
not only the four upper castes but also Muslims, Gwalas, Kurmis,
etc. <i><b>Mera Jivan Sangharsh</b></i>, p. 296.
