<b>SAHAJANAND ON AGRICULTURAL LABOUR AND THE RURAL POOR</b> edited and

<b>SWAMI SAHAJANAND AND THE PEASANTS OF JHARKHAND: A View from 1941</b>
edited and translated by Walter Hauser. Manohar, New Delhi, 1995.<p>
    
THE remarkable shifts in Sahajanand's ideological affiliations
and programmatic commitments and his indelible role in the public
arena has encouraged a considerable number of researches on his
life and activities. At the same time the sheer range of his
engagements in different phases of his life (from a caste
politician, he moved to be the founder of the Kisan Sabha in
Bihar and the All India Kisan Sabha, and subsequently emerged as
an undisputed peasant leader with professed leftist goals), has
left crucial gaps leading to contentions in academic assessments.
It is the second phase of Sahajanand's career, when he was
closely connected with the peasant movement of the 1930s and was
in fact its prime organizer and principal ideologue, that has 
evoked maximum controversy among historians of modern Indian
agrarian history.  Did the Kisan Subha represent poor farmers and
landless labourers? Could it address the specific problems of
tribals?  It is in this context that we can appreciate the
relevance of the two political tracts, Khet Mazdoor and Jharkhand
ke Kisan (the English titles are mentioned above) written by
Sahajanand and edited and translated by Professor Walter Hauser. 
These books, Hauser rightly points out, 'inform us of the thought
and mind of one of the leading activists of his day.' (Sahajanand
on Agricultural Labour and the Rural Poor, p. 64)<p>
    
     Hauser is not unaware of the divergence of opinions
regarding Sahajanand. In the editorial introduction to Khet
Mazdoor he writes: 'It is presumed that he (Sahajanand) was
essentially representing the interests of the well-to-do, or at
best middle peasants.... But these are perceptions which
dramatically undervalue the mind and activism of an exceedingly
complex man....' (Agricultural Labour. p. xiv-xv ) The two
tracts, unpublished earlier, clearly show that Sahajanand did not
restrict himself to protecting the interests of peasants with
tenancy rights; rather he had systematically moved 'in the
direction of an activism representing the marginal poor, whether
peasants or landless agricultural laborers....' (Agricultural
Labour, p. xv-xvi)<p>

    
     Sahajanand argues that the agricultural labourers such as
'the herdsmen. ploughmen, and others who directly work the land'
(Agricultural Labour, p. l ) not only constituted the largest
majority among the agrarian classes but also served as the very
foundation of the agrarian structure. Hence no substantial change
in agrarian relations was possible without addressing the problem
of their exploitation.  Sahajanand was convinced that a
fundamental change in agrarian relations could be brought about
only by a united  front comprising of these agricultural
labourers and the poor peasants. This tract elaborates
Sahajanand's vision of united front. At the same time it betrays
the tension inherent in the process of coordinating the interests
of the agricultural labourers and the peasants.<p>
    
     Sahajanand argued that it was futile to organize a movement
only of agricultural labourers. Unlike factory workers, they
lacked revolutionary potential. Materially they clung on to their
paltry belongings, and their differing caste and religious
affiliations left them a divided lot.  In the agrarian sector
they had to content with an array of exploiters which included
the zamindars, the sahukars and the poor peasants. Their
agitation against the poor and marginal peasants, who also
employed them, would not yield any relief since the latter
themselves suffered at the hands of the zamindars and the money
lenders.  Such internecine struggle could only jeopardize the
scope of a joint effort by classes whose interests were similar. 
There was no significant financial difference, Sahajanand argued,
'between the conditions of the real kisans whom we call poor
middle kisans and the condition of 98 per cent of agricultural
labourers.'  (Agricultural Labour, pp. 61-62)  As a matter of
fact the class<p>

++Page 66<p>

of agricultural labourers was not a 'fixed one'. It comprised of
members from all classes, particularly from the class of poor
peasants who had lost their land to the zamindars and money
lenders. The problem of agricultural labour were thus primarily
economic, and concerned people of all castes and religious
groups.<p>
    
     Sahajanand could not, however, overlook the conflict between
the agricultural labourers and the poor peasants.  He confessed
that whereas it was essential to keep 'the agricultural labourers
and kisans within a single peasant organization, i.e., the Kisan
Sabha', it was equally necessary to find 'ways to prevent their
exploitation by the kisans....' (Agricultural Labour, p. 113) He
urged the poor peasants to financially help the former and to
treat them 'on the basis of equality and brotherhood'
(Agricultural Labour, p. 93). Nevertheless he was loathe to drive
a permanent wedge between the two classes. The fundamental
problems of agricultural labourers, such as that of unemployment,
inadequate wages and landlessness could be solved only by a
united struggle of the people. The objective would be to force
the government to create job opportunities and, more importantly,
'to dispossess those zamindars from all their zirat and bakasht
lands who are not dependent on cultivation.'<p>
    
    Unlike the Khet Mazdoor tract with its focus on the class
exploitation of agricultural labourers (replete with references
to the Soviet experience) in Jharkhand ke Kisan Sahajanand
emphasizes the exploitation of the Adivasi 'cultural and physical
environment' (Swami Sahajanand and the Peasants of Jharkhand, p.
10) by non-Adivasi outsiders. His motivation to begin another
tract, only three months after the completion of Khet Mazdoor,
was because as an activist he was clear that no agrarian movement
could be launched in a region unless one was acquainted with the 
specific needs of the people, their condition of existence, their
exploitation and misery. Accordingly, Sahajanand deals with
themes such as the spatial location and physical configuration of
the land which accounted for its uniqueness, relative isolation
and its richness in minerals and forest produce; the diversity of
languages and culture of its inhabitants (the Adivasis), their
land system, village society, and community life; the educational
and developmental backwardness of the region and the exploitation
of Adivasis by jagirdars, zamindars and sahukars; the rarely
comprehensible land tenure system, tenancy regulations, and the
legal system. and a betrayal of the people by the government and
the Biharis. In order to emphasize the 'open loot', Sahajanand
repeatedly drew a parallel between Jharkhand and Viharkhand,
i.e., the rest of the  state of Bihar.<p>
  
     It may be noted that Sahajanand saw the 'tribals' as the
'original inhabitants' of Jharkhand, and therefore primarily
employs the term 'Adivasis' when refering to them.  He saw them
as true kisans (pakke kisans) since they loved their land as much
as they loved their jungle and could not 'live without these two
central elements of their lives'  (Peasants of Jharkhand, p. 37).
(Interestingly, Sahajanand suggests that the Adivasis, unless
they were converted, were all Hindus.) Sahajanand pointedly
contrasts the helplessness and exploitation of the kisans with
their potential for positive change. What had betrayed the
Adivasis, in his opinion, was the middle class affiliations of
their leaders, and the infiltration of non-Adivasis into the
leadership. 'If organized on the basis of their class interest,'
Sahajanand suggests, 'they (the kisans) can become a powerful
force whom no one can crush' (Peasants of Jharkhand. p. 37). <p>

     As Hauser correctly points out, this tract should not be
read as a history of Jharkhand or as an examination of land
systems, forest policies and so on. Rather, its importance lies
in that it reflects the impressions of one of the most active
peasant leaders of Bihar on issues concerning the people of
Jharkhand. When one remembers that most accounts of Jharkhand
have survived primarily in the records of colonial administrators
and ethnographers (S.C. Roy's writings being an exception), the
historical significance of the tract is reinforced.<p>
    
     Hauser has understandably decided not to rewrite or revise
Sahajanand's accounts of the khet mazdoor or the Adivasis of
Jharkhand; nor is he interested in checking their historical
accuracy. He has provided an editorial endnote at the end of
every chapter in order to 'amplify, clarify and provide
bibliographic definition to Sahajanand's text' (Peasants of
Jharkhand, p. 77), an editor's glossary with a brief
introduction. and most importantly the original Hindi text.  The
editorial notes, which reconstruct the historical context and
ideological milieu in which Sahajanand marshalled his thoughts,
raise some new problems in historiography.  Hauser seems to posit
a direct correspondence between Sahajanand's ideas and the
prevailing political and material situation. This encourages
Hauser to constantly stress the applicability of Sahajanand's
concepts to the 1980s and 1990s. Sahajanand's historical role can
be assessed even without insisting on his relevance to recent
times. Some of the notes are too detailed and appear irrelevant.
For example, why is it necessary to discuss Krishna Ballabh
Sahay's daily visits to Palamau during the famine of the
mid-1960s as an endnote to Sahajanand's comment on the barrenness
of the Palamau district of Chotanagpur! (Peasants of Jharkhand, 
p. 24-25). A final comment on a minor factual error: the Adivasi
Mahasabha did not emerge out of the Unnati Samaj in 1938 as
Hauser seems to suggest (Peasants of Jharkhand, p. 9); both arose
as independent organizations. At a time when the attention of
historians is focused around the history of identities, the
publication of these two political tracts by one of our most
important peasant leaders, assumes relevance. For any serious
scholar of peasant history, these books provide useful reference.<p>
