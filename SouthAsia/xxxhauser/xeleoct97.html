<blockquote>The trends in the October 1996 by-elections in Bihar appear
to confirm the results of the Lok Sabha election of April and May 1996
in the state. The Janata Dal (JD) is under political and electoral
stress while the BJP and the Samata Party alliance is emerging as the,
largest beneficiary. The JD in Bihar is a victim of organisational
weakness as a party and its near-total reliance on the person and career
of Laloo Prasad Yadav.  </blockquote>

 <center><font size="+1"><b><a name="part1">I</a></b></font></center> 

<p>THE year since the parliamentary elections of April and May 1996 has
by any definition been one of the more remarkable times in history of the
Indian polity. One must go back to late May 1964 and the death of Jawaharlal
Nehru, or to the ominous days of June 1975 and the emergency of Indira
Gandhi to identify points in the 50 years of India's freedom so potentially
compelling in their political import as the events of the year past. Few will
perhaps recall the anxieties widely felt but seldom expressed about the nation's
future in the absence of its first prime minister and one of the brightest
luminaries of the generation of founders. And in 1997, even June 1975 is little
more than a remote memory in the lives of vast numbers of Indians.  

     <p>It is perhaps useful therefore to recall that as significant as these earlier
transitions were in the potential directions and perceived dangers they posed
to the body politic, the nation not only met them with a firm resolve but in the
process affirmed the democratic idea as the guiding principle by which
"Bharat" that is India would govern itself in representing the common weal of
its citizens. It was precisely the institutional structures of government the
people gave themselves in the Constitution of 1950 which resolved the
perceived crisis of succession in 1964. And it was the mechanism of electoral
politics enshrined in that same Constitution which resolved, in the massive
vote of 1977, that India would govern itself from that time "forward by the
democratic will of the people.   

     <p>I recite this history as a reminder to those .of us, who, whether
academic observers or citizen participants in the life of the nation, that
whereas government and party politics may be under stress in the 50th year of
freedom, the constitutional instrumentalities for keeping the system on course
are in place, and in some cases indeed,  resilient. And none is more resilient
than the electoral process itself, whatever its marginal flaws, and the free vote
of the people it assures. The central argument of this brief inquiry into the
11th general election in Bihar is precisely that it is 'The People' who are the
central players in the politics of democracy in the late 20th century, just as
they were the central constituents in the politics of freedom in the 1920s,
1930s, and 1940s leading to their tryst and that of Jawaharlal on August 15,
1947. As everyone agrees, it is a destiny yet to be fully realised. But it is in the
seeking and the achieving that a fuller measure of political, social, and
economic freedom for all Indians, from all castes and classes, and beginning
with the poorest of the poor in the most remote mofussil villages of the land,
that those goals and that destiny will ultimately be realised.  

     <p>These meanings of democracy we redefined by that great American
president of the common man, Abraham Lincoln as governance of, by, and for
the people. That it is an ideal seldom achieved and very often at tragic cost is
an idea poignantly made by Carl Sandburg in a remarkable collection of
poems published in 1936 under the title <b><i>The People, Yes</i></b>.[<a
name="rf2599.1"></a><a href="#n2599.1"><b>1</b></a>] Sixty years
later I cannot resist quoting from this poetry as an introduction to these brief
reflections on the 11th general election in India and more specifically in Bihar.
Sandburg writes: <p>

<blockquote>

The people will live on. The learning and blundering people will live
on.<br>

They will be tricked and sold and again sold and go back to the
nourishing earth for rootholds,<br>

The people so peculiar in renewal and comeback,<br>

You can't laugh off their capacity to take it.<br>

The mammoth rests between his cyclonic dramas, Yes,<br> 

There are dreams stronger than death. And finally,<br>

Who shall speak for the People? Who has the answers, where is the sure
interpreter? Who knows what to say?  </blockquote>

     <p>It seems fully appropriate to cite these vivid images of the American
poet in remembering the 21 peasant women and children of Bathani Tola in
Bhojpur district, who were murdered in cold blood on July 11, 1996, and to
remember their kinsmen and fellow villagers who continue the struggle for
justice and decency in the killing fields of Bihar. One might make the same
appeal to memorialise the 10 landless agricultural labourers of the Musahar
Tola of Habaspur village in Patna district, who were lured from their homes
and celebrations on March 23, 1997, the eve of Holi, not to be fed but to be
massacred; or to the eight lohars, chamars, dhobis, and kahars of Ekwari
village in Bhojpur, including four women, who were raped and murdered by
the Ranbir Sena with the connivance of the local police on April 10. And the
list of villages and victims goes on in a continuing litany of mayhem and
killing; Belaur, Khopira, Chandi, Charpokhri, Patalpura, Nonaur, Narhi, and
Khanet to name but a few.  

     <p>And one might well add to this list the political killings of
Chandrashekhar Prasad and Shyam Nandan Yadav, CPI(ML) cadres
addressing a street meeting on March 31, at the JP Chowk in Siwan. This was
a variation on the "normal" pattern of agrarian violence in Bihar to be sure,
but a serious reflection nevertheless, in the matter of civil political discourse.
The irony of the Siwan killings happening in JP Chowk, or that Shyam
Nandan Yadav, one of the victims was from Ziradei, the home village of
president Rajendra Prasad will also not be lost on most readers. Nor is it
perhaps a coincidence that those killings were allegedly committed by the
henchmen of Shahabuddin, the local JD MP, himself under a charge of murder
going back to the day of the May 1996 Lok Sabha elections itself, or that
Shyam Nandan Yadav had contested against Shahabuddin in both the 1990
and 1995 assembly elections.  

     <p>That Habaspur, Ekwari, and Siwan happened only a matter of days
after Laloo Prasad Yadav's 'Maharailla' or Garib Rally on March 18, perhaps
also tells us much about the nature of politics and administration in the Bihar
of 1997. 'Me rally was widely hailed by the chief minister's supporters,
including prime minister Deve Gowda who was in Patna for the event, as a
powerful confirmation of Laloo's populist appeal among the poor and the
dispossessed. The [<b>++Page 2600</b>] public press viewed the rally and its
massive expenditure of rupees more soberly as an exercise in public and
private extortion while the administrative apparatus of the state was put at the
political service of Laloo Yadav. The perceptions of the poor who came or
were brought to the rally, and who left without the saris or dhotis they were
promised has not been widely documented but is certain to be a political issue
in the weeks and months ahead.  

     <p>This recent history reveals that the killing fields of Bihar have over 25
years become the site of persistent warfare against the poor, the weak, and the
exploited of the rural countryside.[<a name="rf2600.2"></a><a
href="#n2600.2"><b>2</b></a>] This violence is not new. What is new
is that in the seven years of Laloo Prasad Yadav's chief ministership as the
populist champion of the poor, the problem has become endemic.  

     <p>In the meantime no solutions appear to be in sight as Bihar descends
into a state of 'administrative atrophy' and 'anarchy' to quote recent
observers.[<a name="rf2600.3"></a><a
href="#n2600.3"><b>3</b></a>] The citizen victims of this crisis
environment continue to be brutalised while the political leaders of the JD in
Delhi and Patna concern themselves with the apparently graver issue for them
of Laloo Prasad Yadav's right or suitability to continue as president of the JD
in the shadow of major fodder scam charges.[<a name="rf2600.4"></a><a
href="#n2600.4"><b>4</b></a>] The chief minister himself refers to
those charges of the CBI, now awaiting sanction from the governor, as his
"hour of crisis".[<a name="rf2600.5"></a><a
href="#n2600.5"><b>5</b></a>] Whether or not the current
confrontation results in a split of the JD, the fact that an issue which is plainly
an internal party affair has escalated to the level of charge and counter-charge
in the Delhi High Court between Laloo and his working president Sharad
Yadav, gives cause for pause and deep public cynicism. And this
micro-management by the courts, inevitably makes any political anxiety about
judicial activism less compelling.  

     <p>And all the while governor A R Kidwai of Bihar takes issue with the
union home minister over whether Bihar is indeed suffering from a crisis of
law and order. The more serious issue in fact is whether the state is on the
verge of infrastructural collapse at the most fundamental levels of
administering a civil society. It is that issue which will define the political
profile of the state in the weeks and months immediately ahead and it is that
issue in its complex permutations which will determine the political and
electoral future of the chief minister and his allies and opponents. And it is the
people, the citizen voters of Bihar who will, in the final analysis, make those
decisions. They are decisions obviously which will bear heavily not only on
what happens in the political life of Bihar, but that of Delhi as well. And as we
know well, it was in late April and May of 1996, that the voice of the people
was firmly expressed in this decision-making process. It is significant to recall
that they did so for the 11th time since the achievement of freedom in 1947.  

     <p>While some presume that the message the voters sent in 1996 was not
clear, I submit that it was patently clear to those who would listen. Among
other things, it was that the governments of 1996. and 1997, as all their
predecessors have learned, some more pointedly than others, hold office in
this democratic land by the will and at the sufferance of the people. The word
that comes most quickly to mind to describe this political, historical
experience is accountability. One presumes that Deve Gowda, Gujral,  Kesri,
and Laloo Yadav, among many others, fully understand the political
implications of this fact, hence their collective and legitimate anxieties about
facing the voters in a potential l2th general election before its appointed time.  

     <p>The result of the people's choice in 1996 is a strong move in the
direction of a regionalised politics and a continuing sequence of coalition
governments at the centre. The countervailing logic to this trend is that of a
nationalising and centralising BJP, though that perception must immediately
be qualified by the obvious fact that the BJP, barring a sea change in national
voting patterns, must inevitably rely on regional party support should it aspire
to power at the centre.[<a name="rf2600.6"></a><a
href="#n2600.6"><b>6</b></a>]  

     <p>There are two other related and significant features of the Indian polity
in 1997, namely, that of an activist judiciary, which is both driven by and
seized With the second dominant issue, that of political corruption. There are
of course legitimate anxieties about the infringement of the courts on the
executive and legislative authority of government.[<a
name="rf2600.7"></a><a href="#n2600.7"><b>7</b></a>] At the same
time it must be said that there is a strong anti-corruption mood in the country
and that the activism of the courts is in fact widely endorsed by the people. It
is also widely suggested that the judiciary has in a very real sense stepped in
by force of circumstances to fill the vacuum left by the other two branches, or
as in the case of political corruption, caused by them. My point here is not to
review the history of political scandals at the centre or in the states, and I will
raise the issue for Bihar only to reinforce my point about the people's
sensitivity to what are obvious issues of concern in their daily lives.  

     <p>One of these is obviously the fodder scam and it must be noted that
the issue stands where it does in 1997 not only because of the investigations
and charges of the Central Bureau of Investigation, but because of the
monitoring of the case by the Patna High Court through the division bench of
Justice S N Jha and Justice S K Mukhopadhyaya at the specific direction of
the Supreme Court.[<a name="rf2600.8"></a><a
href="#n2600.8"><b>8</b></a>] That Bihar has been defrauded of an
estimated Rs 950 to 1,500 crore, the largest part of that amount in the years
since 1990, a period when the chief minister also held-the finance portfolio,
has implications for the fiscal and infrastructural integrity of the state that
should be obvious.[<a name="rf2600.9"></a><a
href="#n2600.9"><b>9</b></a>]  Even the lower figure of Rs 950 crore,
comes to Rs 100 for every man, woman, and child of Bihar's population, now
exceeding 90 million. If the scam was news to the political elites of Delhi and
Patna after it broke into public view in January 1996, it was certainly less so
to the citizen voters of the state, a fact which seemed patently clear in the
results of the Lok Sabha election of 1996 and the 10 assembly by-elections of
October 1996.  

     <p>Given this evidence one then wonders why or how 1996 was so
widely viewed as an election without issues. For example, the historian Rajat
Kanta Ray wrote pointedly about 1996 that, "if there is an issue in the
forthcoming elections, the adult population of India has not located it yet".
Finding no evidence of 'market, Mandal, or mandir' in the campaign, Ray then
notes the profound disillusionment of the electorate with every political party.
He allows that "India's vast electorate [is] at the moment entirely without a
sense of direction".[<a name="rf2600.10"></a><a
href="#n2600.10"><b>10</b></a>] To be sure the electorate maybe
disillusioned, but to suggest that they have no sense of direction somehow
misses the point about the nature of democratic politics. Ray's assumption that
only the parties and the politicians define the issues has an element of truth to
be sure, but in the end it is ultimately the people who, make that
determination. And for the people, central among many issues in 1996 was
obviously corruption as Jayalalitha, Laloo, and Narasimha Rao, among others,
might ultimately. agree. That certainly appeared to be the case in Bihar. <p>

Back <a href="#top">to the top</a>.<p>

 <center><font size="+1"><b><a name="part2">II</a></b></font></center>

     <p>There were many rich ironies in the politic drama played out in Delhi
in the days  following the election of 1996 and be the ascension of Deve
Gowda, none perhaps more poignant than those involving the president of the
JD and the sitting chief minister of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav. Barely 48 at
the time, Yadav has now served as chief minister of India's second largest
state longer than any of his predecessors other than Krishna Sinha, who
assumed that office as early as the first Congress ministry in 1937, and
remained chief minister without  interruption from 1946 until his death in
1961. Laloo's seven plus years in office is accordingly an impressive record of
political longevity by any standard.  

     <p>But the ironies of May and June 1996 have only been compounded in
the, year since  involving the leadership of the Congress and most especially
that of Sitaram Kesri, the entire leadership of the JD and the United Front
(UF), and finally and most critically [<b>++Page 2601</b>]  of course, Laloo Prasad
Yadav himself. It is his fortunes as the chief accused in the Bihar fodder scam
on which not only his chief ministership rests, but the JD as government in
Bihar, its integrity as a unified party in Patna and Delhi, and the UF as
governing coalition at the centre. For good or ill, Laloo is effectively the
central figure in Indian politics in mid-1997, though I will attempt here to
confine myself to his role as the main political player and still widely popular
chief minister of Bihar.   

     <p>Laloo Prasad Yadav was named leader of the JD legislature party
following the 1990 assembly elections and became chief minister in March
of that year. In the Lok Sabha elections of May and June 1991, the JD
won 32 seats outright in Bihar, and with the support of its National
Front - Left Front allies, the CPI with eight seats, the CPM one, the
Jharkhand Mukti Morcha with six, and one independent, it controlled 48
of the 54 seats. The BJP won five seats in that election, all in
Jharkhand, and the Indian National Congress, one seat, in Begusarai.
This was a political dominance for the JD and its NF-LF partners almost
unknown in Indian electoral history.

<p>It was a dominance confirmed in the legislative assembly elections of
1995 when Laloo's JD wave literally swept aside all opposition with a
majority of 165 seats in an assembly of 324. With its CPI (26) and CPM
(6) allies, the JD thus controlled 196 seats, and with 41 seats the BJP
trailed far behind as the main opposition. Congress had '30, the JMM 16,
other Jharkhand parties 6, the CPI (ML) 6, the recently formed Samata
Party 5, independents 13, and other parties 10.

     <p>On the surface this appeared to be both an enviable and an
unassailable position of power, and Laloo's own image of invincibility
was confirmed by his being named all-India president of the JD in
January 1996. This ,followed on the resignation of S R Bommai "to dispel
the cloud of suspicion against him in the Jain hawala case".[<a
name="rf2601.11"></a><a href="#n2601.11"><b>11</b></a>] It was
coincidentally in January 1996 that the first reports of the Bihar
fodder scam began to surface into public view. Apart from the obvious
ironies in this history, it was only when he was named JD president that
the Delhi media an to take serious notice of Laloo Prasad Yadav and
almost immediately began to see him as a potential candidate for the
prime- ministership. For five years he had been widely dismissed by the
urban press as a rustic buffoon, speaking not only the language but
using the social idiom of the poor, yet now he was seen as a prime
minister-in-waiting. Of course, both images were flawed, the first
because it ignored the absolutely brilliant skills of a complex and
consummate populist political campaigner and vote-getter, the second
because it ignored what are widely considered to be his limits as an
administrator.  And his apparent failure to apprehend the very idea of
systematic development and change, leave alone to engage in its
implementation.

     <p>In the meantime, with Laloo's new image as a major political
player, prominent residents of Delhi's diplomatic enclave soon found
their way to Patna to meet this political wonder of the common man, and
the chief minister assured one and all that his second term would be one
not only of social justice for the poor, stability and communal harmony,
but economic growth and develop ment. And trips to south-east Asia and
the US, and the Patna conference of NRls, who signed memoranda of
understanding galore, seemed evidence enough to the Delhi press that the
benighted Biharis had finally found a leader to match their rich
potential. There was scarcely a weekly newsmagazine or newspaper
supplement that did not carry a feature story of the redoubtable Laloo
as campaigner and man of the people. 'Laloo bhaiya' was described as the
raja, the messiah of the poor, the 'desh ka neta', who would carry the
message of social justice, self respect, and economic redemption for the
poor of Bihar, to Delhi itself. Indeed, 'Dilli chalo' became both the
symbol and substance of the chief minister's campaign message in 1996.

     <p>His public self-assurance carried through the final days of
campaigning as did the press reports suggesting that the voters were
indeed mesmerised by their 'Laloo bhaiya' and were solidly behind him,
the complaints of people along the way about roads, electricity,
pensions, pakka houses, and the subsidised saris and dhotis he had
promised everyone below the poverty line, notwithstanding. Of course,
Laloo promised everything in good time, explaining in the meantime his
repeal of toddy tapping and fishing taxes, among other measures meant to
benefit the poor.[<a name="rf2601.12"></a><a
href="#n2601.12"><b>12</b></a>]

     <p>By campaign's end Laloo was moving at a killing pace, making as
many as seven or eight campaign stops a day, at one hour, and sometimes
30-minute intervals, travelling by helicopter, then finishing, as he did at Kurtha
in Jehanabad constituency of central Bihar on May 2, with village stops along
the way in his 'garib chetna rath'. This converted bus was used literally and
figuratively as the vehicle to project the awareness and self-respect of the
poor. It was a low key approach but brilliantly effective in the hands of this
quintessentially populist chief minister. This was not the rath of the south
Indian movie heroes turned politician, or of Lai Krishna Advani of the BJP,
but an entirely unpretentious rath of the poor, the common people of rural
Bihar.  

     <p>And when he invited them to Delhi for tea, or to vote for the sitting
CPI candidate in Kurtha, "who will raise his hand on my behalf, so the poor
will have a voice in Delhi", he did so with understated calculation. When you
make me the prime minister, we will bring money from Delhi to help the poor
of Bihar, he said. In all of this he neither appeared disingenuous, nor was he
lecturing at his peasant audience of 4,000, but in effect talking with them, as if
he were sitting in heir village huts, as in fact he often did. They laughed with
him when he, explained that many untouchable musahars now had pakka roofs
on their houses, whereas poor upper caste bhumihar brahmans did not, "but
we will do that too, if you vote for the CPI/JD ticket".  

     <p>He was quietly but pointedly reinforcing he social justice theme of his
first term, of assuring 'izzat', ie, self-respect to the socially and economically
deprived of the land. Then he explained in great detail how to vote, how to
mark the ballot, how to stamp it on the appropriate party symbol, how to fold
it and lace it in the ballot box, as he literally dropped a sample ballot between
the microphones where he was seated. It was a disarming and impressive
performance, and while the voters of this constituency gave his candidate a
strong winning margin, for the state as a whole, of course they did not. My
sense was that the peasant voters at Kurtha were intent on listening and
learning, and they were often amused by their chief minister, with whom they
felt completely relaxed, but they were obviously not mesmerised, as the press
almost inevitably presumed. My reading is rather that much of the press was
mesmerised, as were many of Laloo's political associates and allies in Delhi
and Patna. Only since his imminent charge-sheeting in late April, and early
May 1997, have they begun to distance themselves from the chief minister.  

     <p>Based on the 1996 election results one might infer that the
voters were rather more erceptive at an earlier point in time about what
in fact was happening than much of the political leadership. For example,
comparing the 1996 Bihar results with 1991, the JD dropped from 32 to 22
of the 54 Lok Sabha seats, the CPI from 8 to 4 seats, while the CPM lost
its lone seat giving the NF-LF combine in Bihar a total of 26. In the
meantime the JMM stood independently of the NF-LF in 1996 and was reduced
from six seats to one in the new parliament. And finally, Pappu Yadav, the
lone Samajwadi MP, while standing with the UF at the centre is, however,
vigorously opposed to Laloo in Bihar itself. And given the anticipated
charge-sheeting of the chief minister in the fodder scam, the entire Left,
including the CPI is calling for Yadav's resignation, thereby leaving the
parliamentary strength of the JD at its base figure of 22, compared to
the 48 seats Laloo effectively controlled in 1991 .[<a
name="rf2601.13"></a><a href="#n2601.13"><b>13</b></a>]

     <p>However one juggles these numbers, [<b>++Page 2602</b>]
defections to the Samata Party and Congress in the interim
notwithstanding, the JD decline from its near-total dominance of 1991 is
dramatic by any definition. The Indian National Congress which had one
seat in 199 1, lost that seat but won two others, while the BJP improved
sharply from 5 to 18 seats, capturing 12 of the 14 seats in tribal
Jharkhand, and six seats in north and central Bihar. It is important to
note that of those 18 seats, six are SC-ST seats from among the 13
reserved constituencies in Bihar, and two of these six are non-tribal
seats in central Bihar previously held by the JD and the CPM, Buxar and
Sasaram, respectively.[<a name="rf2602.14"></a><a
href="#n2602.14"><b>14</b></a>] The BJP's anti-Laloo partner in this
election, the Samata Party, which was formed in 1994 as a breakaway of
the JD, won six seats, giving that combine 24 seats, effectively passing
the JD in the strength of their Lok Sabha numbers.

     <p>Equally important in considering these figures are the vote percentages
involved. In the three assembly elections of 1985, 1990, and 1995 the' BJP
generated percentages of 7.5, 11, and 12.9, respectively, while in 1996 it
moved to 20.54 per cent of voter support.[<a name="rf2602.15"></a><a
href="#n2602.15"><b>15</b></a>] These successes were further
enhanced by the Samata Party alliance with its 14.45 per cent of the vote
share, for a 1996 total of 35 per cent, thus exceeding the JD's 31.8 per cent
and effectively equalling the combined 36.88 per cent when adding the CPI's
5.08 figure to the JD alliance, now however fractured. The 1996 Congress
percentage was 11.26, the JMM 2.48, the CPI (ML) 1.48, Samajwadi 1.29,
and CPM 0 82. What is notable here is that the BJP percentage of the vote
share exceeds the percentage of upper or 'forward' castes and middle urban
castes normally thought of as the sole BJP support base. As all of these
figures show, the BJP has also intruded heavily into the Chhotanagpur tribal
belt, where the JD and the INC are effectively non-existent and the Jharkhand
parties are badly fragmented. [<a name="rf2602.16"></a><a 
href="#n2602.16"><b>16</b></a>]  

     <p>The BJP and the Samata Party, individually and jointly, were in 1996
the major anti-Laloo party formation in Bihar. As the fodder scam
charge-sheeting has proceeded, a second anti-Laloo alliance including
primarily the CPI (ML), CPI, CPM, and Samajwadi Party has also taken
shape on the left, although it must be noted that the ML's vigorous opposition
to Laloo is not a recent development. And as I have suggested earlier, the
anti-Laloo pressure of the combined opposition has now been joined by
dissidents from within the JD itself.  

     <p>The political calculus of these results is an obvious function of the
splits in the backward caste, untouchable-dalit, and Muslim alliance which
Laloo had crafted so brilliantly before and after the 1990 and 1991 elections.
For Laloo the assumption that his populist caste rhetoric would keep him in
office for 20 years-as the leader of a broad based social coalition, was marred
by what one observer has rightly described as a limiting "tunnel vision" that
has reduced him in mid-1997 to the status of yet another yadav leader.[<a
name="rf2602.17"></a><a href="#n2602.17"><b>17</b></a>] And as
the October by-elections and the current round of fractious infighting in Delhi
and Patna make clear, even that position is being contested, albeit in the latter
case within the framework of broader JD infighting.  

     <p>There are obviously many elements involved in the fragmentation of
Laloo's grand alliance. I will note here only one or two of the more tangible
factors in this complex mix of social, economic, and political realities on the
ground. Among the most obvious is the 'yadavisation' phenomenon whereby
the chief minister, openly cynical of the idea of serious administration, has
nevertheless involved himself in widespread transfers and postings to the
narrow interests of his caste fellows and political supporters. Anyone remotely
familiar with Bihar can identify the number and proportion of police officers
or other officials of what caste have ascended or descended in their postings
at the whim of the chief minister. That very idea and its implementation for
example, had much to do with the formation of the Samata Party in 1994 by
the engineer and kurmi leader, Nitish Kumar.  

     <p>But as the historian Arvind Das rightly points out, the Samata Party
phenomenon has much deeper social, economic, and political meaning than a
simple-minded reaction to an overzealous yadav chief minister. Despite the
widely-held perception of Bihar as no more than a place of mass poverty,
backwardness, and violence, the state does have a history, and that means
change, and it also means growth.[<a name="rf2602.18"></a><a
href="#n2602.18"><b>18</b></a>] Among other groups involved in this
cycle of change, the upwardly mobile kurmis have both driven and been a
product of that history and the economic growth it has generated. For
example, Das, who knows Bihar as well as anyone, reports that there are
more professionals, especially, doctors and engineers among the kurmis than
any other caste.[<a name="rf2602.19"></a><a
href="#n2602.19"><b>19</b></a>] These are people not likely to be
attracted by Laloo's politics of poverty, whether he claims to represent the
OBCs or not. By the same token they are presumably equally concerned about
a civil society of law and order where kidnapping, train robberies, and murder
are far too common a feature of everyday life, no matter one's social status or
professional position.  

     <p>And while some observers are concerned only with this crisis of "law
and order", it is also true that upwardly mobile middle castes like the kurmis,
koeris, and of course yadavs as well, have been active creators and
beneficiaries of dramatic changes in agriculture. It is an agriculture which at 3
per cent has a growth rate as high as most in the country, despite the effective
failure of any public investment in this sector.[<a name="rf2602.20"></a><a
href="#n2602.20"><b>20</b></a>] This achievement, for example, is
visible in the towns and fields of the Nalanda parliamentary constituency
which George Fernandes, the Samata Party candidate won massively in 1996.
As I moved briefly through that constituency in late April 1996, 1 was struck
by a number of low key but very visible markers of prosperity. Tube wells,
cold storage facilities at virtually every crossroad, and vast fields of yellow, oil
bearing sunflowers; all three obviously indicating a progressive, productive
agriculture, It is not a coincidence that yadavs and kurmis, each at just above
10 per cent of the population, comprise the largest demographic segment of
this rural constituency.  

     <p>It is also not a coincidence that the Samata Party candidate won this
seat in 1996 by a margin of 1,67,864 seats or 55.1 per cent out of 8,83,016
votes cast. Even more notable is the fact that the incumbent and losing
candidate was V K Yadav, of the CPI and hence supported in this election by
Laloo Prasad Yadav. Third position went to the CPI (ML) candidate with
33,184 votes or 3.7 per cent, and fourth position, notably to the INC with
25,772 votes or 2.9 per cent. Most important in assessing these figures is the
10 per cent drop in votes garnered by the JD-supported CPI candidate from
46.54 per cent in 1991 to 36 per cent in 1996, and the effective collapse of the
Congress between those two elections. The INC candidate in 1991 attracted
2,73,695 votes or 34.84 per cent, which means a Congress drop off of more
than 90 per cent between 1991 and 1996. The Samata Party was clearly the
beneficiary of these INC and CPI (and hence JD) losses.  

     <p>The other reality of post-Laloo dominance in Bihar politics is
the softening of. the scheduled caste-dalit support base which Laloo has
done so much to cultivate. His subsidised or free dhoti-sari scheme is
directed specifically at this constituency, but the very self-respect
logic which Laloo has done so much to generate, has inevitably served to
raise expectations, especially to the absence of promises fulfilled.
Among the four dissident ministers recently sacked by the chief minister
are both yadav and scheduled caste leaders, and the subsequent
resignation of Pashupati Kumar Paras, the brother of Ram Vilas Paswan,
the railway minister at the centre, has brought this new power node to
more open public notice.

     <p>The formation of an all-dalit morcha early  in 1997, including MLAs
from the BJP   well as the ruling JD with a pointed concern over the
fundamental issue of atrocities [<b>++Page 2603</b>] against scheduled caste
citizens, was an earlier element in the growing political presence of former
untouchables on their own terms. That other left parties, especially the CPI
(ML),had been making a political issue over these sena killings for years, does
not make this more recent development any less compelling or politically
significant. From the perspective of the chief minister, the most serious public
demonstration of scheduled caste opposition came from the Dalit Chhatra
Morcha at an Ambedkar Mela on the Gandhi Maidan in late April 1997. With
the students shouting "Go back Laloo, killer of dalits", the chief minister, on
the advice of his advance party, chose not to make an appearance.[<a
name="rf2603.21"></a><a href="#n2603.21"><b>21</b></a>]  

     <p>These various combinations and recombinations of caste, class and
creed are obviously relevant in understanding the, results of this or any other
election. But it is what the sociologist Dipankar Gupta refers to as specific
secular and political interests, and to which I would add economic interests
and personality interactions, which are increasingly decisive in determining
how people vote.[<a name="rf2603.22"></a><a
href="#n2603.22"><b>22</b></a>] As is true for any social or religious
segment of society, whether Muslim, yadav, dalit, kurmi, rajput, or whatever,
these are never unitary solidarities in any political sense. And the fragmenting
of the M-Y factor,[<a name="rf2603.23"></a><a
href="#n2603.23"><b>23</b></a>] the Muslim and yadav support base
of the JD, for example, in the 1996 election in Bihar is a good case in point, as
is the upper-backward caste alliance of the BJP Samata Party as an anti-Laloo
formation.[<a name="rf2603.24"></a><a
href="#n2603.24"><b>24</b></a>] The more recent lift opposition
alliance, effectively led by the CPI (ML), makes the same point. The
expectation is that it is these parties which will be the beneficiaries of this
opposition in any forthcoming election in Bihar, whether for the Lok Sabha or
the legislative assembly. What seems clear in the present climate is that
Congress and the JMM, already fractured and suffering, and the JD, will be
the losers.  

     <p>However, my explanatory argument goes beyond this standard social
and political calculus to suggest that issues of political freedom as well as
economic and social freedom and the allied issues of social justice and
self-respect have a long history in Bihar. These are fundamental human rights'
in this society as in any other, and Laloo Prasad Yadav, coming as he did out
of the student movement of the early and middle 1970s, has certainly brought
the issue and the idea to a new level of awareness in Bihar. But to repeat, the
concept is not new in Bihar or elsewhere in the country for that matter.  

     <p>I think here of the contributions of Swami Sahajanand, Panchanan
Sharma, Jadunandan Sharma, Karyanand Sharma, Kishori Prasanna Singh,
Ramnandan Mishra, Dhanraj Sharma, Ganga Sharan Sinha, and Jayaprakash
Narayan, and more recently Karpoori Thakur, among many, many others
active in the public life of Bihar in this century. And of movements like the
Kisan Sabha, the Triveni Sangh, the Bihar Socialist Party, and the CPI, mostly
under the umbrella of the Congress, whose activisms and objectives were in a
very fundamental sense of, by and for the people. Few will know that it was
yadav peasants who, in 1927 pleaded with Sahajanand to aid them in their
struggles against the bhumihar brahman zamindars of Masaurhi, and that it
was from that beginning that the most powerful peasant movement in India,
the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha emerged. And among the many beneficiaries
of that movement were precisely those productive and upwardly mobile
middle agricultural caste groups now courted so assiduously by all political
parties in Bihar, whether left, centre, or right.  

     <p>It is also revealing to note that Sahajanand and the Kisan Sabha were
equally seized with the issue of equity, justice, and izzat for the poorest of the
poor, issues to which all parties lay claim in 1997, including here especially
the CPI (ML), which is active in many parts of the state but primarily in those
areas where the Kisan Sabha itself was most active in the 1930s.[<a
name="rf2603.25"></a><a href="#n2603.25"><b>25</b></a>] The
near-equal division of the vote in the Arrah constituency in 1996 between the
JD, the Samata Party, the CPI (ML), and the Indian National Congress, in
that order, makes these points nicely,  

     <p>It is this history and its memory in 1996 which provided the citizen
voters of Bihar, across the political and social spectrum, a strong sense of
their place and their rights in this society. And it reinforces the high
expectations of performance they demand from the political leaders they elect. 

     <p>I recall the response of Karpoori Thakur during the emergency of
Indira Gandhi when she rationalised that Westminster democracy was not
meant for countries like India. What Indians wanted and needed was bread.
Karpoori, who was underground at the time explained pointedly, 'Hamko
azadi aur roti chahiye', that is, we want freedom and bread, a memorable
observation I take to be deeply etched in the"collective mind of the citizen
voters of India and Bihar,  

     <p>Putting that logic in the context of 1996, one might say that the voters
of Bihar gave a similar message, to wit, 'Hamko izzat, roti, dhoti, aur pakka
makan chahiye', namely, we want self-respect yes, but we also want bread,
dhotis, and pakka houses. In other words, the voters of Bihar have supported
massively the idea of social justice and self-respect, and perhaps now they are
reminding the political establishment that they want performance and an
improvement in the quality of life, symbolised in the broadest sense in the roti,
dhoti, pakka makan metaphor.<p>

     <p>The most recent evidence we have of voter sentiment in Bihar, and
based on a wide, though random, geographical distribution in the state, are the
October 1996 by-elections. I will conclude this reflection with a brief review
of these 10 assembly constituencies, all of which were won by JD candidates
in the sweep of 1995, and all of whose sitting MLAs were elected as JD
members of the Lok Sabha in the general elections of 1996. The point here
obviously is that these were strong JD constituencies, and the results of the
by-election, so soon after the parliamentary election of April and May 1996,
and barely 18 months after the 1995 assembly elections, may certainly be
taken as a preliminary indicator of voter sentiment, following on the argument
in the pages preceding, but well before the full import of the fodder scam
became public currency.  

<p><a href="table.html"><img src="im/tabt.gif" 
alt="Click here to see full Table." border=0 align=right></a> 

I will proceed with a table [Click 
<a href="table.html">here to see Table</a>]  
comparison between the 1995 assembly
results and the October 1996 assembly by-election results for these 10
constituencies. From that point I will comment briefly about relevant
circumstances bearing on each constituency, then conclude with inferences
that might be drawn from these constituencies taken as a random sample. It
should be noted at the outset as already indicated, that the JD won all ten
constituencies in 1995, and retained six in the by-elections. Of the four lost by
the JD, three went to the Samara Party and one to the BJP. It is also relevant
to note that five of the constituencies are in north Bihar, and five in Gangetic
Bihar south of the Ganga.  

     <p><b><i>Baikunthpur</i></b>: In the home district of the chief minister and in the
Gopalganj Lok Sabha constituency, Baikunthpur was among the safest of JD
assembly constituencies. It was also a prestige constituency for Laloo
inasmuch as the 1991 JD MP and former Congress chief minister, Abdul
Ghafoor had gone over to the Samata Party and was a third place finisher in
the 1996 Lok Sabha poll. The Samata Party candidate in the October 1996
by-elections was Brijkishore Narain Singh, a second place finisher in the 1995
assembly election on the Congress ticket, a four time MLA and former
minister of the state government. The JD ran up its highest vote tally here of
any of the 10 seats being contested. It should also be noted that the Samata
Party-BJP alliance was at work in these by-elections as indicated in the
accompanying table, and to their obvious advantage,  

     <p><b><i>Ziradei</i></b>: This is the home constituency of S M
Shahabuddin, now in jail on a murder charge stemming from the killing of
CPI (ML) cadres on the day of the 1996 Lok Sabha election, which he won.
In 1990 [<b>++Page 2604</b>] Shahabuddin narrowly won this assembly seat
over the Congress candidate while running as an independent. He then won
the seat on the JD ticket in 1995, but with a substantial Samata, Party
showing. That Samata Party vote went to the BJP in the 1996 by-election,
which lost to the JD candidate but by a margin of only 2,403 votes. This
narrow margin suggests that the voters may be less dominated by the whim
of the local power broker, Shahabuddin, now in jail, than once presumed.
The emergence of the CPI (ML) in this north Bihar constituency, however
minimal, is a development to be noted, especially given the murderous
opposition of Shahabuddin to their efforts. Finally, the continuing
decline of the Congress, in the home place of India's first president,
Rajendra Prasad, is a visible phenomenon here as elsewhere in the state.

     <p><b><i>Belsand</i></b>: In the Sheohar parliamentary constituency in the north-west
quadrant of north Bihar, this was by any definition a prestige seat for the JD
and the chief minister. The 1995 incumbent was Raghubansh Prasad Singh,
won the Vaishali seat in the 1996 Lok Sabha election, and is one of the three
JD MPs from among the 10 seats considered in this by-election analysis to be
named to the Deve Gowda ministry at the centre. That the seat was won by
Brishen Patel, formerly a JD MP now running as a Samata Party candidate,
made the confrontation with the chief minister that much more compelling.
Notable here is the swing both to the winning Samata Party from its 1995
showing and the dramatic influence of the Samajwadi Party, though not a
significant force in Bihar politics overall, in determining the outcome of this
election. The Samata Party vote was obviously also influenced by the fact that
another of north Bihar's power brokers, Anand Mohan, won the Sheohar seat
in the Lok Sabha election on the Samata Party ticket. It was presumably the
very high stakes involved of so many major players which accounted for the
dramatic increase in voter participation in this election, although short of
closer inquiry, this logic can be no more than an. estimate of what in fact
happened.  

     <p><b><i>Warisnagar (SC)</i></b>: That the JD won in this reserved
assembly segment of the reserved Rosera parliamentary constituency
situated in central north Bihar, is less significant than that its
margin was well below 2,000 over the second place BJP candidate. And
this in a Lok Sabha constituency where Ram Vilas Paswan, currently
railway minister at the centre had won massively in the 1991
parliamentary election. In 1996 be stood from Hajipur, and the Rosera
seat was won by Pitarribar Paswan, the incumbent in the Warisnagar
assembly seat. This was essentially a straight contest between the BJP
and the JD with the other three contesting parties playing impsortant if
marginal roles in determining the outcome, though the Samajwadi and ML
votes were more than sufficient to prevent a BJP win.

     <p><b><i>Jokhihat</i></b>: This seat in the Kishenganj Lok Sabha
constituency of far northeast north Bihar was won by M Sarfaraz Alam,
the son of Taslimuddin who had held the seat on five previous occasions,
most recently in 1995 as the Samajwadi Party candidate. Taslimuddin won
the Kishenganj Lok Sabha seat on the JD ticket in 1996 and was promptly
named minister of state for home at the centre, but then forced to resign
under a cloud of alleged criminal involvement, to the considerable
embarrassment of Deve Gowda, and Laloo Prasad Yadav.

     <p><b><i>Katoria</i></b>: This assembly segment of the Banka Lok
Sabha constituency is situated on the eastern edge of south central
Bihar and is one of the safest JD assembly seats. Katoria .and
Baikunthpur are the only two seats of the 10 contested in October 1996
where the JD made gains in its winning margin from 1995. The incumbent,
Girdhari Yadav won the Banka Lok Sabha, seat, and was replaced in, the
Katoria seat by Bhola Yadav.

     <p><b><i>Paliganj</i></b>: This and the Piro constituency are two of the more complex
in the political history of the state in recent years, and involving some of its
major players. The Paliganj assembly segment is situated in the Patna district
but in the Arrah Lok Sabha constituency. The seat was won in 1990 by Ram
Lakhan Singh Yadav as a Congress candidate, with the CPI(ML) candidate in
second position and Chandra Dev Prasad Verma of the JD a distant third. In
1991 Ram Lakhan won the Arrah Lok Sabha seat as a JD candidate and ally
of Laloo, then in the interim reverting to the Congress and accepting
appointment in the Narasimha Rao ministry at the centre. And in the process,
of course, severely alienating Laloo Prasad Yadav. In 1995, Chandra Dev
Prasad Verma, with massive support from Laloo won Paliganj on the JD
ticket, the position from which he contested and won the Arrah Lok Sabha
seat in 1996 to be named a minister in the cabinet of Deve Gowda. He retains
that position though currently under a charge- sheeting cloud in the
multi-crore fodder scam. He has not been asked to resign by prime minister
Gujral, presumably anticipating sanctions by governor Kidwai. As the table
shows, all parties were critical players in the by-election, but it was the
bhumihar Janardan Sharma of the BJP who won in this backward and
scheduled caste dominated constituency. The spoiler role of the Samajwadi
Party of Pappu Yadav is again obvious in this dramatic turnaround and says
much about the alienation among yadav voters in this constituency from their
chief minister, and reinforces the argument that caste is only one among many
variables in this political environment. The Congress decline in the absence of
Ram Lakhan was precipitous, following on his fourth place finish in the 1996
Arrah Lok Sabha race, trailing the JD, Samata Party, and CPI(ML),' in that
order.  

<p><a href="table.html"><img src="im/tabt.gif" 
alt="Click here to see full Table" border=0 align=right></a>
 
 <b><i>Piro:</i></b> The 1995 incumbent in the Piro segment of the Bikramganj Lok
Sabha constituency on the west side of the river Sone, was Kanti Singh. With
undivided support from Laloo Prasad  Yadav, she won the Bikramganj Lok
Sabha seat in 1996 and was promptly elevated to the position of  
[<b>++Page 2605</b>] minister of Staten the cabinet of Deve Gowda, a
position she retains under Gujral. That her Piro constituents heckled her
hand-picked successor candidate in the by-election campaign, says much
about the decline of JD fortunes in this backward and scheduled caste
agricultural constituency.[<a name="rf2605.26"></a><a
href="#n2605.26"><b>26</b></a>] The JD candidate was a third place
finisher after the Samata Party winner and the second place CPI (ML)
candidate. The Samata Party winner was Shivanand Tiwari.  

     <p><b><i>Nabinagar</i></b>: This constituency in a segment of the Aurangabad Lok
Sabha constituency, in the south-west comer of the old Gaya district and in
the heartland of Congress dominance. As recently as the 1996 parliamentary
election, Satyendra Narain Singh, the Congress chief minister of Bihar in
1989, and the son of Anugrah Babu, a major political player of the 1930s, was
a second place finisher in this Lok Sabha contest, and in fact won the
Nabinagar segment with well over 33,000 votes. The Lok Sabha seat was
won by the JD candidate and Nabinagar incumbent, Virendra Kumar Singh,
and it was that seat which was being filled in this by-election. The massive
vote for the Samata Party candidate, Lovely Anand, suggests the party's skills
at mobilising votes, in this case significantly of its rajput supporters, but
certainly not exclusively so. The party exhibited those same skills at Belsand
where it convinced rajput voters to support its kurmi candidate, and at Piro
where its candidate was a brahmin. In the end political tactics and skill in
executing them do count, whatever the social demography involved.  

     <p><b><i>Barachatti (SC)</i></b>: Barachatti is an assembly segment in the Chatra Lok
Sabha constituency directly south of Gaya. The 1995 incumbent JD candidate,
Bhagwati Devi, won the Gaya (SC) seat in the 1996 parliamentary election
and was succeeded in Barachatti by Jitan Rain Manjhi of the JD, a former
minister of the Bihar government. This was essentially a straight contest
between the JD and the 13JP with the latter doubling its vote total from 1995,
and the JD marginally up in its vote count.  

     <p>In absolute terms, it was the Samata Party which was the most
successful in this round of by-elections, winning three of the four seats it
contested, namely, Belsand, Piro, and Nabinagar. But even in Baikunthpur, a
safe JD seat, the Samata Party managed an impressive 47,832 votes. On the
other hand, while the Samata Party's ally, BJP won only one of the six seats it
contested, the difficult Paliganj seat, it was a very close second in Ziradei and
Warisnagar and tallied in excess of 27,000 votes in the two SC reserved
constituencies of Warisnagar and Barachatti. Only in Jokhihat and Katoria
which were certain JD wins, was the BJP showing marginal.  

     <p>The Samajwadi Party in all likelihood cost the JD two seats, possibly
three, just as it may have cost the CPI (ML) the Pali seat. The CPI(ML) in the
meantime built on its strength and was a factor in both Pali and Piro, and
exhibited a modest but new presence in Ziradei and Warisnagar in north
Bihar, a fact which was potentially offset by its weaker showing in Nabinagar
and Barachatti. The biggest loser of course was the Congress which suffered
disastrous declines in all constituencies except Jokhihat where it held its own,
but still achieved only a third place finish in a constituency apparently owned
by Taslimuddin.  

     <p>The results for the JD and for Laloo Prasad Yadav are rather more
complex. Most damaging certainly for the chief minister were the stinging
defeats in Bel sand, Paliganj, and Piro where not only his reputation was on
the line, but that of the three ministers he hand-picked for places in the central
cabinet. And the Nabinagar loss cannot have been a happy one, given the
margin of the Samata Party win. Of the six seats won by the JD, three were
essentially safe seats, Baikunthpur, Katoria, and Barachatti for which the JD
and Laloo must be given full political credit. Of the remaining three, Ziradei
and Jokhihat are constituencies in which Laloo was scarcely a factor, and in
Warisnagar (SC), the fact that the JD bested the BJP by a mere 1,753 votes
can give the chief minister little comfort.  

     <p>In the end, the trends in the October by-election appear to
confirm the results of the Lok Sabha election of April and May 1996.
This is clearly a pattern of a JD under political and electoral stress
in which the BJP and the Samata Party are the strongest beneficiaries
given their role as the largest opposition alliance in the state. The JD
in this case is also victim to its organisational weakness as a party
and its near-total reliance on the person and career of Laloo Prasad
Yadav both as chief minister and as president of the JD. To repeat what
seems obvious, the fortunes of the party are clearly tied to Laloo.<p>

 <center><font size="+1"><b><a name="part4">IV</a></b></font></center>

     <p>As I have suggested, it was widely believed that 1996 was an election
without issues. But I suspect what is being said is that it was an election
without catchy slogans. What in the US are referred to as bread and butter
issues, or gut issues, are equally important in India. To push the point further,
for example, if teachers and non-gazetted employees, and others are not paid
their salaries for months, indeed years on end, that is clearly an issue which
will agitate the electorate. And the recent history of kidnappings, train
robberies, and what are casually referred to as atrocities, are equally
meaningful issues for the citizen voters. To be told by the press and the
establishment ,that there is a law and order problem, and in the process
condemning randomly described "naxalites," and landlord senas as equal
partners in these killings, is only a small step from blaming the poor for being
poor. As most people will understand, these are systemic problems and they
have causes, and stigmatising the poor and portraying Bihar as a mindless
caricature of the human experience of a large part of India, is unfortunately no
solution.  

     <p>For seven years Laloo Prasad Yadav presented himself as the solution,
but that too now seems sadly unlikely, an opportunity missed by someone
who had a massive mandate. But that mandate and the promises he made
were also issues and indeed made of him an issue, as he certainly seemed to
imply by his rhetoric and actions, as he still does. Yet some observers in Delhi
and Patna went so far as to suggest that the rural voters of Bihar were
oblivious of, or unconcerned with the multi-crore animal husbandry scam,
thinking that inasmuch as everyone did it, why hold the current incumbents
liable? By this logic it is only the urban middle classes who are concerned
about corruption.  

     <p>But I am persuaded that in 1996 this was a bad misreading of the
sensibilities of the citizen voters of Bihar. They were not only aware
of what was happening but deeply pained and offended that their 'Laloo
bhaiya' might have betrayed them. His opposition to a CBI investigation,
since enforced by the Patna High Court and sustained by the Supreme
Court, did little to allay their anxieties. What the arrest of Shyam
Bihari Sinha and others directly implicated in the scam, and the
subsequent charge-sheeting of 56 politicians and administrators,
including the chief minister may mean for Laloo and for the state, only
time will tell. However, we can say that CBI reports and charges by the
office of the comptroller and accountant general appear far more serious
than anyone had earlier thought likely or possible. The attempted
suicide of the animal husbandry minister when he lost in the Bagaha
constituency, suggests that he too thought that the fodder scam,
extending over a period of 15 years, was a potent issue. As does the
recent spate of killings and/or suicides of others charged or involved.
And the assumption, at least my assumption, is that the voters also know
about the bitumen scam, the Ranchi land scam, the drugs scam, the police
uniform scam, etc. After all, they live in Bihar.

     <p>My conclusion obviously is that Indian voters know far more about
their social, economic, and political interests than some cynical urban
observers give them credit for. The World Bank definitions of literacy and
illiteracy are not terms in my explanatory lexicon of life in rural India.
Peasants do not [<b>++Page 2606</b>] need to read an English language newspaper
to cast an informed and intelligent ballot. They produced the food and
provided the political constituency which achieved freedom in 1947, and I am
persuaded that they play an equally critical role in the political process in 1996
and 1997. They are the backbone of the dynamic democratic polity that is
India in the late 20th century.  

     <p>In the circumstances, whatever happens in the election of the JD
president, or in the governor's sanctioning the charge-sheeting of the chief
minister and others who are allegedly implicated, we will know more sooner
than later. And in the process the future of Laloo Prasad Yadav, of Bihar, the
JD, and the UF government will inevitably become more clear. But one thing
is certain, just as Indira was not India, nor was India Indira, to paraphrase the
inimitable words of D K Barooah, so Laloo is not Bihar nor is he India. The
people are. The expectation is that they will prevail.  

     <p>They will almost certainly do so confident in the qualities of
accountability of their leaders expressed so vividly by Jawaharlal Nehru in
1953 in addressing the Rajya Sabha: "As prime minister, I accept
responsibility for every single act of this government, including every bad act,
every act of nepotism, every act of corruption, I am responsible; I accept that
position. I am not prepared to evade responsibility for any act of this
government". It is a lofty but legitimate ideal.<p>

make it all go smoothly. I have been assisted along the way by many people,
all of whom will recognise their contributions on the printed page. However,

landlord senas, and the responses of the state is enormous. A survey of the
issue in the context of the 1990 assembly election and the 1991 Lok Sabha
election in Bihar can be found in my 'Violence, Agrarian Radicalism and
Electoral Politics: Reflections on the Indian People's Front', <i>The Journal of
Peasant Studies</i>, 2 1:1 (October 1993), pp 85-126. For a more recent review
see the brief but useful essay of Mammen Matthew 'The Killing Fields of
Bihar', <i>The Hindustan Times</i>, Patna edition, February 10, 1997. The
Hindustan Times, Patna edition, and <i>The Times of India</i>, Patna edition both
provide consistent on the ground coverage of this long running rural tragedy.

best view from the 'inside' so to speak is found in <i>Liberation</i>, central organ of

     <p><a name="n2601.12"><b>12</b></a> The sari-dhoti gambit is one of the most
frequent in Laloo Yadav's arsenal of populist gimmicks. It has been employed
again and again and more frequently in recent months as the chief minister has
come under increasing pressure from the CBI, his political opposition, and
from dissidents within his own party. The most common version is that saris
and dhotis will be provided at a subsidised cost of Rs 15 a pair to what is
described as Bihar's 72,00,000 families below the poverty line. Where the
estimated Rs 200 crore to fund this project will come from, given the state of
Bihar'& finances, is not clear. For an early rendering of this issue see 'Laloo
Strums His 'Cheap Dhoti' String Again', <i>The Telegraph</i>, June 26, 1996, p 5. It
might be noted that this scheme was part of the JD election manifesto in the
1995 assembly elections.  <a href="#rf2601.12">BACK</a><p>  

     <p><a name="n2601.13"><b>13</b></a>    The CPI indeed will move a
no-confidence motion against the government in the budget session of the
assembly, scheduled to begin on June 23,1997. The legislature party leader,
Ambika Prasad indicated the motion would be tabled against the Laloo
ministry because of the impending fodder scam charge-sheeting of the chief
minister, large-scale corruption, and the deteriorating law and order situation
in the state. "CPI sources said the no-trust motion was being moved to wipe
off the pro-Laloo image of the party", <i>The Times of India</i>, June 8, 1997. It is
obvious that the outcome of such a motion depends entirely on extent of
non-CPI, and dissident JD support it might attract.  <a

     <p><a name="n2602.14"><b>14</b></a> The point here is an obvious one though
often overlooked. Representation of scheduled castes and tribes is not
confined to the JD, Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, or other
non-BJP parties. The BJP won 41 reserved seats in 1996, almost doubling its
share of SC and ST members of parliament from the 22 the party held in
1991. See Arun Kumar and the PTI, <i>The Turning Point: 1996 Poll Story</i>

     <p><a name="n2602.19"><b>19</b></a> Arvind Das who is from north Bihar, is
both a trained historian and a professional journalist and his essays in the
public press reveal a sensitivity to social and political reality seldom found on
the printed page. His critical eye does not gloss over the tragedy of Bihar, nor
on the other hand does it ignore the social and economic realities and
potential that create the politics of the late 20th century. For a fine example of
this balanced reporting of the current crisis of the JD and of Bihar, see his
'Still Paying Old Debts', <i>The Telegraph</i>, June 6, 1997.  <a

     <p><a name="n2602.20"><b>20</b></a> See Das in <i>The Telegraph</i>, June 6,1997.
That there are few secondary or tertiary opportunities for investing the fruits
of this agricultural success is an issue beyond the scope of this essay. Das
touches on the para-banking sector as one such opportunity which is widely
used, but I have in mind here more fundamental infrastructural opportunities,
for example, in industry and transportation which would provide wider
economic spinoffs than para-banking or urban construction.  <a

     <p><a name="n2603.24"><b>24</b></a> The term 'opportunism' is commonly
applied to alliances like that of the BJP and Samata Party. It is of course an
entirely apt definition in the world of democratic politics not only in India, but
the world over. Alliances in politics are meant to win elections and gain power
and clearly any politician or party which denies this opportunistic fact, is being
at best disingenuous.  <a href="#rf2603.24">BACK</a><p>  

     <p><a name="n2603.25"><b>25</b></a> Two recently published political tracts
of Sahajanand's from 1941 are especially revealing of this history, at a time
when Sahajanand was already using the term dalit, well before it came into
common use as a description for the exploited poor. See Walter Hauser (ed),
<i>Sahajanand on Agricultural Labour and the Rural Poor</i> (Delhi: Manohar,
1994), and Hauser, (ed), <i>Swami Sahajanand and the Peasants of Jharkhand</i>
