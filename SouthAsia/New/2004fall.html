<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Urdu translation of the Quran</B></FONT>.  The
library is in the process of purchasing a rare book, an Urdu translation
of the Quran, published in the first years of the twentieth century,
which Mehr Farooqi has obtained a copy and is using for her research
about the various translations of the Quran.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Alderman Library Cataloging District
Gazetteers</B></FONT>. Reference librarian Sajjad Yusuf organized a
committee for the cataloging of South Asia microfilm materials and under
his leadership the project has moved forward. With the support of the
Acting Director of Cataloging Erin Stalberg, Cataloging Coordinator K.
Suthar has begun the detailed task of individually cataloging the
Library's microfiche collection of the 1221 District Gazetteers. Richard
Barnett has contributed to the project by providing a work-study student
under K. Suthar's supervision, and K. Suthar consults with library
selector Philip McEldowney and updates him on the progress of the
project.</P>

<P>The Gazetteers were compiled by British colonial administrators in
India in each district and sub-division, and included the details about
the region that the administrative officer could collect and record.
Recorded in English, they included geographic and demographic
particulars as well as the historical background of the region. In
addition, they recorded any notable events in a region, such as riots,
famines, or natural disasters. The Gazetteers were mainly published in
the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries, and are the basis for
revised and updated District Gazetteers published from the 1950s on.
Today, the Gazetteers provide an invaluable and often unique source of
historical information about colonial India at a regional level-with the
caveat, of course, that such knowledge was filtered through the eyes and
ears of British colonial administrators.</P>

<P>Previously, the Gazetteers were listed in VIRGO (Alderman's online
library catalogue) under a single entry: <B><I>District Gazetteers of
India</I></B>.  Under this entry, the Gazetteers could not be
individually searched by district name and dates. The eventual goal is
to have them catalogued by the name of the district. For about one-third
of these districts, especially the Princely States and Burma, there are
no established "authority" records and this process involves several
stages: detailed searching and listing of the area by exact geographic
terminology, sending it to the Library of Congress for approval and
revision, and contributing the new authority recrod to the world-wide
Online Computer Library Center's (OCLC) data base of more than 57
million records. More records will continue to be added, but already,
researchers may search for a particular Gazetteer in VIRGO by
"<B><I>District gazetteers of (district name)</I></B>" (Try, for
example, <B><I>Gaya</I></B>.) One may see all the records cataloged so
far by searching "<I><B>District gazetters of India</B></I>." The
project was begun in the fall of 2004 and is scheduled to be completed
within a year's time.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>14 different editions of the Tibetan Buddhist
Kanjur (bka' 'gyur) and Tanjur (Bstan 'gyur) identified</B></FONT>.
Since October 2003 to middle of September 2004, I (Nawang Thokmey) was
able to spend two hours every week in the Tibetan collection especially
with the different editions of Kanjur and Tanjur; how to use these
editions and catalogues. So far I have identified that we have fourteen
different editions of Kanjur and Tanjur in our Tibetan collection in
Alderman Library; all these are in different formats in book (4), pecha
(5), and microfiche (4), and C.D (1).  You can find the detailed listing
