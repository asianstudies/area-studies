<td valign=bottom>hagirath was very young 
when his mother Chandi was declared a bayen, a witch, and was thrown
out of the village.</td></tr></table><p>

<i>A bayen is not an ordinary witch. She cannot be killed like an ordinary one, because to kill a
bayen means death for your children.</i> So Chandi was made a pariah and put in a hut by the
railside.<p>

Bhagirath was raised by a foster mother. He never knew what a real mother was like. Now and
then, he did [<b>++Page 36</b>] 

get a glimpse of the shed across the field under the tree where Chandi bayen lived alone. Chandi,
who could never be anybody's idea of a mother. He had also seen the red flag
fluttering on her roof from afar, and sometimes, in the flaming noon of April, he had seen her
red-clad figure, a dog on her trail, clanking a piece of tin across the paddy fields,
towards the pond.<p>

<i>A bayen has to warn people of her approach</i> . She has but to cast her eye on a young man or boy
and she would suck the blood out of him. A bayen has to live alone, see no one.<p><p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>O</b></font>ne day, and one day only, Bhagirath 
saw his father, Malindar, talk to the bayen.<p>

"Look away, my son," his father ordered.<p>

Bhagirath caught the reflection of the red-clad figure in the pond, a sunbronzed face framed by
wild, matted hair and eyes that silently devoured him. No, the bayen did not look at him directly.
She looked at his image, as he saw hers, in the dark waters. Shuddering violently, he closed [

<b>++ Page 37</b>] 

his eyes and clung to his father.<p>

"What made you come here?" hissed his father at her.<p>

"There's no oil for my hair, Gangaputta, n o kerosene at home. I'm afraid to be alone."<p>

She was crying, the bayen was crying. In the waters of the pond her eyes seemed to swim in
tears.<p>

"Didn't they send your week's ration on Saturday?"<p>

Every Saturday someone from the Dom community of the village went to the tree with a week's
provision: half a kilogram of rice, a handful of pulses, oil, salt, and other food.<p>

<i>A bayen should not eat too much.</i><p>

Calling on the tree to bear witness, he would leave the basket there and run away as fast as he
could.<p>

"The dogs took it all."<p>

"Do you need some money?"<p>

"Who will sell me anything?"<p>

"Well, okay, I'll buy the things and leave them by the tree. Now, go away."<p>

"I can't, I can't live alone ..."<p>

"Who asked you to be a bayen, then? Go away! Go away!"<p>

[<b>++ Page 38</b>]</center><p>

He picked up a handful of mud an(ii stones from the pondside.<p>

"Gangaputta, this boy ... ?"<p>

With an ugly oath he threw it at her.<p>

The bayen ran away.<p>

Malindar covered his face with his hands, and cried bitterly. "How could I do it? It used to be a
body as soft as butter. How could I be such a beast?"<p>

"You, you talked to her, Baba?"<p>

Malindar looked up and smiled. "So?"<p>

Bhagirath was terrified. To talk to the bayen meant certain death. The thought of his father dying
scared him; he was sure that his stepmother would throw him out then.<p>

Malindar said, his voice growing sombre, "She may be a bayen now, but s he used to be your
mother once."<p>

A bayen for a mother! Is a bayen a human being then? Hadn't he heard that the bayen raises dead
children from the earth, hugs and nurses them? That whole trees dry up the instant a bayen looks
at them? And he, a live boy, born of a bayen's womb?<p>

"She used to be a woman, your mother," Malindar sighed. "It was bad luck, hers, yours and mine.
Once a [<b>++ Page 39</b>] 

bayen, she's no longer human. So, I tell you, you don't have a mother."<p>

Bhagirath stared in awe at his father as they walked back along the mud culvert.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>T</b></font>hey were not 
ordinary Doms. They worked in the cremation grounds and the municipality
allowed only one Dom family to work there. His family made things out of cane and
bamboo sticks, raised poultry, made compost out of garbage.<p>

In the entire Dom community only Malindar knew how to sign his name -an accomplishment that
had recently earned him a job ir% the subdivisional morgue; a government job
that entitled him to forty-two rupees a month. He also bleached skeletons of unclaimed bodies,
using lime and bleaching powder. A whole skeleton, or even the skull or rib cage,
meant a lot of money. The morgue official sold the bones to would-be doctors at a handsome
profit. The ten or fifteen rupees that he got out of it he invested in usury, and bought
some pigs with the interest. He was a respected man in the community. He [<b>++ Page 40</b>] 
went to his subdivisional office in shirt and shoes.<p>

Bhagirath went to the government primary school. He learnt that there was something called the
Constitution of India, where it is written at the very beginning, that all are equal.
But Bhagirath and his kind knew that their co-students, as well as the teachers, liked them to sit a
bit apart, though none but the very poor and needy from the "lower" castes came
to the school. In spite of this, the fact was that his accent had changed.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>R</b></font>ed-eyed, Malindar stared at the 
ragged red flag above the bayen's hut -- a dot of kumkum against
the saffron coloured horizon.<p>

"She had everything, when she was your mother, my wife. I gave her sarees to wear and silver
jewellery. I rubbed oil in her hair, her body ... She used to be so afraid of the
dark," he muttered. "Did fate have to make a bayen out of her, son?"<p>

"Who makes a bayen, Baba?"<p>

" God."<p>

Malindar glanced around wearily to [<b>++ Page 41</b>] 
see if any shadow hovered near Bhagirath in the midday sun.<p>

<i>Bayens are crafty in their art, like any flower girt in the market</i>. If she was keen on having some
child, a bayen would walk close by, her face in shadow, in spite of the fierce
sun all around. Invisible to mortals, she would cast the shadow of her veil on the child as he
walked. If the boy died she would chuckle with feigned innocence.<p>

"What is there for you to fear, my son?" Malindar said. "She'd never do you any harm."<p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>A</b></font>s days went by, Bhagirath's mind began 
to stray towards the hut. Be it on the paddy field, or on
the pasture with the cows, his mind would rush to the railside, if only to see
how terror-stricken the bayen was of her loneliness, to see how she oiled her hair and dried it in
the April wind.<p>

He was too afraid to go to her. Perhaps he would never come back if he did. Perhaps she would
turn him into a tree or a stone for ever. He had a mad wish to rush to the hut,
then afraid of his own wish, he swiftly traced his way back [++ Page 42] 
home, wondering why no one mistreated him for being a bayen's son.<p>

<i>If you treat a bayen's son ill, your children will die</i>.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>B</b></font>hagirath's present mother 
didn't ill-treat him either. In fact, she never betrayed any emotion for
him whatsoever. She had two girls, Sairavi and Gairavi. And she had no
influence over her husband - first, because she hadn't borne him a son and second because she was
ugly with such protruding teeth and gums that her lips couldn't cover
them.<p>

She would say, "Gangaputta, be sure to cover my face when I die or else they'll say, There goes
the buck-toothed wife of the Dom."<p>

Jashi did nothing but work all day. But she knew that if she didn't take proper care of Bhagirath
the bayen might kill her daughters. Also, she knew she'd have to depend
on him in her old age.<p>

Sometimes she would sit, chin in hand, terrified that the bayen was working a magic spell on her
daughters that very moment or making their effigies out of clay. At those
times Jashi, [<b>++ Page 43</b>] 
looked uglier than usual.<p>

Malindar had deliberately married the ugliest girl in the community because when he had married
the loveliest one, she had turned out to be a witch. Everyone knew that
Malindar had loved his first wife deeply. Perhaps it was that love which had prompted him to tell
his son everything about Chandi bayen.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>O</b></font>ne day, they were walking 
along the railway tracks. Malindar had a parcel of meat under his
arms. It was one of his strange weaknesses that he could not kill the pigs he
raised. He sold them to others and when he needed some meat, he got it from one of his
customers.<p>

"Let's sit a while under this tree," he told his thirteen-year-old son.<p>

After a while Bhagirath asked, "This is the place the robbers go by, isn't it, Baba?"<p>

Those days, the evening trains passing through Sonadanga, Palasi, Dhubulia and other places were
frequently robbed. They came in all shapes and sizes, these robbers ...
posing as gentlemen, poor students, refugees, [<b>++ Page  44</b>] 
settlers or houseowners, to get into the compartments. Then, at a predetermined place and time
they would pull the emergency chain and make the train stop in the darkness. Their
accomplices would rush in from the fields. They would loot, even kill if necessary, before
disappearing. This banyan tree, in particular, was their favourite haunt after dark.<p>

But, Malindar, at that moment was not thinking about the robbers.<p>

"My son," he said, "I used to be a harsh man but your mother was soft, very soft. What
irony!"<p>

Irony indeed! It was as if God turned the tables in a single day, and Chandi became a bayen, a
heartless child-hunter. And Malindar grew gentle.<p>

Malindar took his son's hand. "Why should you I not know what everyone knows about your
mother?" he said. "Her name was Chandidasi Gangadasi. A descendant of Kalu
Dom, she used to bury dead children. She belonged to a race of cremation attendants, the
Gangaputras and Gangadasis - men and women who cremated the dead ones on the banks
of the Ganga."<p>

[<b>++ Page 45</b>]</center><p>

Malindar would carry bamboo trunks and slice them in the cremation ground while Chandi worked
in the graveyard -- a legacy of their respective pasts.<p>

The graveyard lay to the north of the village, overlooked by a banyan tree beside a lake. If a child
died before it was five years of age, its body had to be buried instead of being
cremated. Chandi's baba used to dig the graves and spread thorn bushes over them to save the
dead from marauding jackals.<p>

On Saturday, he would go round the village carrying a thali in his hand.<p>

"I am your servant," he would call out, "I am a Gangaputra. May I have my rations, please?"<p>

The villagers were frightened of him. They would keep young children out of his way, silently fill
his thali and go away.<p>

One day, a fair girl with light eyes and reddish hair came instead of him. "I am Chandi," she
announced, "daughter of the Gangaputra. My father is dead. Give me his rations
instead."<p>

"Will you do your father's work then?" <p>

"Yes. "<p>

The word "fear" was foreign to [<b>++ Page 46</b>] 
Chandi. She could understand why parents cried when their children died, but the dead had to be
buried, they couldn't be kept at home. It was her job. What was fearsome
or heartless about it? It must surely have been ordained by God himself?<p>

This was the Chandi that Malindar married.<p>

Even in those early days, Malindar was in the bone-business with the morgue official. At night he
used to return home shouting across the field, "I am not scared of
anybody! I am a fire-eater. I have no fear of anyone!"<p>

One night he came upon Chandi, roaming alone, lantern in hand.<p>

"You there!" he said. "Aren't you afraid of the dark?"<p>

Chandi burst into peals of laughter, which rather surprised him.<p>

That very April he married her. The next April, Bhagirath was born.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>O</b></font>ne day Chandi came back crying, 
Bhagirath in her arms. "They stoned me, Gangaputta, they say
I mean evil."<p>

Malindar almost danced with rage. [<b>++ Page 47</b>] 
"Who dares stone the wife of Malindar Gangaputra?"<p>

Chandi changed the topic. "Where's the shirt for Bhagirath?"<p>

Malindar had forgotten. ".Tomorrow, I promise," he said. "A red shirt for my son, a red saree and
a yellow blouse for his mother"'<p>

"No, no, not for me. It only makes people envious and cast an evil eye."<p>

"Don't I know that? At the primary school, they were always skipping classes. I alone learnt how to
sign my name. They were envious. I landed a government job, more envy. I married a golden doll
of a wife, a descendant of the great Kalu Dom, built a new hut, and had two
bighas of land for share cropping, how could they help being envious? Bastards! Get as envious as
you like! I can take it all, 1, Malindar Gangaputra. I'll send my son to school over there, beyond
the railway tracks."<p>

As he spoke, Chandi grew silent. "I have not the heart to do it any more," she said at last. "I have
not the heart to pick up that spade. But it is God's will, what can I do?"<p>

If there had been a male member in [<b>++ Page 48</b>] 
her father's family, he would have done the job. But there was none. She was a Gangaputra,
keeper of the cremation grounds. She belonged to the family of
the ancient Kalu Dom. He who had given shelter to the great king, Harishchandra, when he had
lost his kingdom.<p>

This was the story: When the king was wandering around, a chandal in the burning ghat - Kalu
Dom - had employed him. When Harischandra regained his kingdom and the
ocean-girdled earth was his, he began to dole out large territories.<p>

"What have you got for us?" asked a voice booming large across the royal court. It was the ancient
Gangaputra. His kind could never speak in a low voice nor hear one, because
the fire of the pyres roared eternally in their ears. "You have ordained cattle for the brahmins, daily
alms for the monks. What have you for us?"<p>

"All the burning ghats of the world are yours."<p>

"Swear it!"<p>

"I swear by God."<p>

The ancient Gangaputra raised his [<b>++ Page 49</b>] 
hands and danced in wild joy.<p>

Being a member of this race, could she, Chandi, reject their traditional occupation9 Dare she, and
let God wreak his wrath on her?<p>

Her fear and unease would remain even after the grave was well covered with prickly bushes. At
any time the legendary fire-mouthed jackal might steal in and start digging away
with large paws to get at the body inside.<p>

"God ... God..." Chandi would weep softly and rush home. She would light a lamp and sit praying
for Bhagirath. At those times she also prayed for every child in the village, that
each should live for ever.<p>

"Get hold of somebody else for this work, respected ones!" she said one day to the villagers. "I am
not fit for this any more ..."<p>

No one in the village seemed to listen. Not even Malindar, whose dealings in corpses, skin and
bone, objects of abhorrence to others, had hardened him. When she cried bitterly,
even Malinder scoffed.<p>

[<b>++ Page 50</b>]</center><p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>I</b></font>t was around this time that the terrible 
incident happened. One of Malindar's sisters had come for
a visit with her daughter Tukni, who became quite devoted to Chandi. The
village was suffering from a severe attack of smallpox at the time. When Tukni got the pox,
Chandi, accompanied by her sister-in-law and carrying the little girl in her arms, went
to pay homage to the goddess Sheetala.<p>

As fate would have it the little girl died a few days later, though not in Chandi's house. Everyone,
including the girl's parents, blamed the death on Chandi.<p>

"What, me?"<p>

"Who else?"<p>

"Never!" she thundered, "I swear upon the head of my own child that I've never wished any ill of
Tukni, or of any other child. You know my lineage."<p>

Suddenly those people, those craven, superstitious people, lowered their eyes. Someone
whispered, "What about the milk that spilled out of your breasts as you were piling earth
on Tukni's grave?"<p>

"Oh, the fools that you are!" She [<b>++ Page 51</b>]
stared at them in wonder and hatred. "I don't care if the rage of my forefathers descends upon me.
I quit this job from this very day."<p>

Silencing every voice, she went back home. She asked Malindar if he would get a room near his
new place of work. "Let's go there. Do you know what they call me?"<p>

It was just to calm her down, just to pacify her with a joke, that he said with a loud laugh. "And
what do they call you? A bayen?"<p>

Chandi clutched at the wooden pillar that supported the roof. Excitement, rage and sorrow made
her scream at him, "How could you utter that word, you, with a son of your
own? Me, a bayen?"<p>

"Shut up!" Malindar shouted.<p>

It was dead noon and the time for evil to cast its spell on human beings. Malinder knew this was
when terrible rage and jealousy could easily take hold of an empty stomach and
an uncooled head.<p>

"I am not a bayen! Oh, I am not a bayen!"<p>

Chandi's anguished cry travelled far [<b>++ Page 52</b>] 
and wide on raven's wings, through the hot winds that reached every nook and corner of the
village.<p>

She stopped crying as suddenly as she had begun.<p>

"Let us run away somewhere when it's dark," she pleaded with him.<p>

"Where?"<p>

"Just somewhere."<p>

"But where?"<p>

"I do not know."<p>

She took Bhagirath in her arms and crept near Malindar. "Let me lay my head on your chest. I am
so afraid. I have thrown away my forefathers' job. I feel that I'll never
see you nor Bhagirath any more. God! I am afraid."<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>I</b></font>t was here that Malindar 
stopped speaking and wiped his eyes.<p>

"What happened next?"<p>

And Malinder continued: For a few days Chandi just sat as if dazed. Then she went about the
house and often sat with Bhagirath in her arms, singing. She burnt a lot of
incense and lit lamps.<p>

Two months passed by uneventfully. No one came to call Chandi to work. They lived very
peacefully, the three of [<b>++ Page 53</b>] 
them. Chandi became whole again.<p>

"There ought to be some other arrangement for dead children," she would say. "The present one is
horrible."<p>

"There will be, by and by," Malindar said. "Things are changing."<p>

"How am I to know if I did the right thing? Sometimes, at night, I can hear my father call, just as if
he were chasing the jackals off the graves."<p>

"Shut up Chandi ..."<p>

Fear grew in Malindar. Some nights Chandi woke up with a start, hearing the cries of dead
children from their graves. Perhaps Chandi was slowly changing into a witch?
Maybe it would be best to go to the town after all.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>M</b></font>eanwhile, the Doms were keeping 
an eve on her, to her complete ignorance. That's how one
stormy night when Malindar was deep in drunken slumber, his courtyard
filled with people. One of them, Ketan, an uncle of sorts of Chandi, called him out. "Come and
see for yourself whether your wife is a bayen or not!"<p>

<center><img src="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/mahasweta/bayendv.gif" alt="divider">  
<font size="" color="red"><b>Bayen</b></font>  
<img src="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/mahasweta/bayendv.gif" alt="divider"><br>

[<b>++ Page 54</b>]</center><p>

Malindar sat up and stared at them with sleep-laden eyes.<p>

"Come out and see, you son of a bitch! You are keeping a bayen for a wife while our children's
lives are at stake."<p>

Malindar went out. He could see the burial ground under the banyan tree humming with lamps,
torches and people who stood milling around in silence.<p>

" Chandi, you!"<p>

There she was, a sickle in her hand, a lantern burning beside her, a heap of thorn bushes stacked
on one side.<p>

"I was trying to cover the holes."<p>

"Why, why did you come out?"<p>

"The jackals had suddenly stopped their cries. Something in me said, There they are! Right at the
holes, pawing for the bodies."<p>

"You're a bayen!" The villagers raised their chant in awe.<p>

"There is no one to watch over the dead."<p>

"You are a bayen!"<p>

"It's the job of my forefathers."<p>

"You are a bayen!"<p>

[<b>++ Page 55</b>]</center><p>

"No, no, I am not a bayen! I have a Son of my own. My breasts are heavy with milk for him. I am
not a bayen. Why, Gangaputta, why don't you tell them?"<p>

Malindar stared, as if entranced, at the dimly-lit figure. His mind was seared with pain, something
whispered within him, "Don't go near, Malindar. Go near a snake if you will, a
fire even, but not her, though you may have loved her."<p>

Malindar looked at Chandi with bloodshot eyes. He let out a yell like a beast, "O-ho-ooo! A bayen
you are!"<p>

"Gangaputta! Oh my god!"<p>

The terrible cry that tore out of her would have frightened the dead, her father's restless spirit, and
even that of the ancient Kalu Dom.<p>

Malindar rushed to get the drum that had belonged to his father-in-law and ran back to the
graveyard. He shouted as he beat the drum, "I, Malindar Gangaputra, hereby declare
that my wife is a bayen, a bayen!"<p>

"What happened next?" asked Bhagirath.<p>

"Chandi was then forced to live at Beltala. As afraid as she once was to [<b>++ Page 56</b>] 
live alone, she is all alone now. Hush, listen to the bayen sing."<p>

A strange strain of music floated up to them from afar, accompanied by the beat of a tin can. The
song seemed to have no words at first but gradually the lines became
distinct. Bhagirath knew the song. His stepmother sang it to put her daughters to sleep.<p>

The song entered his soul, mingled in his blood and reverberated in his ears like some inscrutable
pain.<p>

"Let's go home, son ..."<p>

Malindar led a dazed Bhagirath back home.<p><br>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>B</b></font>ut a few days later he rushed to the dead 
pond at noon. He had heard the sound of the tin. The
shadow of the bayen trembled in the water. She was not looking at him.
Her eyes lowered, she was filling a pitcher.<p>

"Don't you have another saree? Would you like a saree that is not torn as this one is? Want my
dhoti?"<p>

The bayen was silent.<p>

"Some nice clothes?"<p>

"The son of Gangaputra. had better go home."<p>

[<b>++ Page 57</b>]</center><p>

I go to school now. I am a good boy." <p>

"I am a bayen. Even my shadow is evil. Doesn't the son of
Gangaputra know that?"<p>

"I am not afraid."<p>

"It's high noon now. Young children shouldn't be out in this heat."<p>

"Aren't you afraid to live alone?"<p>

"Afraid? No, I am not afraid of anything."<p>

"Then what makes you cry?"<p>

"Me, cry!"
"I have heard you."<p>

Her crimson shadow trembled in the water. Her voice cracked as she said, "Let the son of
Gangaputra go home and swear never to come near the bayen. Or ... I will tell
Gangaputta!"<p>

Bhagirath saw her turn back and race along the mud culvert, her hair swirling about her, her
crimson cloth fluttering in the air.<p>

He sat alone for a long time by the pond, till the waters became still again. He couldn't recall the
song.<p>

On her part, the bayen sat in silence in her hut. A long while later she raised herself and drew out a
broken piece of [<b>++ Page 58</b>] 
mirror. "I am only a shadow of my old self!" she muttered incoherently.<p>

She tried to run the comb through her hair. It was impossibly matted.<p>

Why did the child talk about nice clothes? Had he not been very young then? How could he
remember?<p>

She frowned hard in an attempt to collect her thoughts. It had been a long time since she had
thought about anything. Nothing was left in her mind but the rustle of leaves, the
whistling of winds and the rattling of the trains -sounds that had muddled up all her thoughts.<p>

Somehow she felt the child was in for some terrible disaster. Suddenly she felt a very wifely anger
at Malindar. Why hadn't he protected Bhagirath from the witch's eyes?<p>

She rose, lit a lantern and hurried along the railway tracks. There was the level crossing, the
linesman's cabin. Malindar, on his way back from work, would turn here to take the
mud culvert.<p>

As she walked towards it, she saw them. They were doing some work on the tracks. No ... they
were piling up [<b>++ Page 59</b>] 
bamboo sticks on the tracks. The 5 Up Lalgola Passenger train was due that evening with
Wednesday's mailbag. It meant a lot of money. They had been waiting for the loot for a
long time.<p>

"Who are you?"<p>

She raised the lantern and swung it near her face.<p>

The men looked up, startled, with fear-dilated eyes and ashen faces. She had never seen the people
of her community so frightened before.<p>

"It is the bayen!"'<p>

"So you are piling bamboos? You would rob the train, eh? What, running away from me? Ha!
Throw away these sticks first, or you are done for!"<p>

But they could not undo what had been done.<p>

The rain lashed her as she picked up the lantern. What should she do? If she were really a witch
with supernatural powers, would. not her servants, the demons of the dark, do
her bidding and stop the train? What could she do now, helpless as she was?<p>

Chandi started running along the tracks, towards the train, waving at it wildly.<p>

"Don't come any further! There's a heap of bamboo piled ahead!"<p>

She continued to scream till the roar of the train drowned her voice and the train's light swallowed
her up.<p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>C</b></font>handi's name spread far and wide for 
her heroic self-sacrifice that had prevented a major train
disaster. Even people in the government came to hear of it. When her body
left the morgue the Officer-in-Charge, accompanied by the Block Development Officer, came to
Malindar's house.<p>

"The Railways is to announce a medal for Chandi Gangadasi, Malindar. I know she used to live
alone, but there must be someone to receive it on her behalf. Everyone is
full of praise. She was your wife, wasn't she?"<p>

Everyone was silent. People looked at one another, scratched their necks in embarrassment and
looked down.<p>

Somebody whispered, "Yes sir, she was one of us."<p>

This statement astonished Bhagirath so much that he looked from one face to another. So they
were recognizing her at last!<p>

"The government cannot give the award to the whole community."<p>

"I'll receive it, sir," Bhagirath said.<p>

"And who are you?"<p>

"She was my mother."<p>

"Mother?"<p>

"Yes sir," said Bhagirath, and the officer started taking it all down. "My name is Bhagirath
Gangaputra. My father, the revered Malindar Gangaputra. Residence, Domtoli,
Village Daharhati ... my mother..." he paused and then, very distinctly, "my mother, the late
Chandidasi Gangadasi ..." Bhagirath broke into loud sobs ... "My mother, the
late Chandidasi Gangadasi, sir. Not a bayen. She was never a bayen, my mother."<p>

The officer stopped writing and stared first at Bhagirath, then at the crowd.<p>

The Doms stood silent, eyes downcast, like people condemned.<p>

The silence was suffocating and unbearable.<p>
