<font size="+3"><b>T</b></font>he Subaltern Studies series has established itself as a
touchstone for research in South Asian history, society and
culture. Each volume is ensured its loyal readership that has 
expanded beyond the horizons of students of (subaltern) history,
which was where it all began many years back. In recognition of
this shift -- or broadening -- the more recent volumes have brought
together essays that are no longer confined to the discipline of
history, displaying, as the editors of this collection describe
it, the Collective's "engagements with more contemporary problems
and theoretical formations". This expansion of critical and
theoretical scope has benefited the fast growing body of South
Asian sociocultural studies, providing it with the (predictable,
but) dependable subalternist slant, routed, usefully, through
history.<p>

     The present volume (IX), edited by two members of the
<b>Subaltern Studies Collective</b>, is made up of nine essays, three of
which were presented earlier at seminars/ lectures. As <b>Amin</b> and
<b>Dipesh Chakrabarty</b> explain in their preface, the aim of the
Editorial Collective is to publish "new and original research on
aspects of subalternity in colonial and contemporary South Asia";
the politics of publishing and marketing demands, of course, that
we accept that the new and original research comes, most often,
from old and established names in the field of historical and
socio-cultural scholarship. And so we encounter, once again,
erudite essays from Ranajit Guha, Gyan Prakash, Susie Tharu and
Tejaswini Niranjana and David Lloyd, amongst others. The subjects
under scrutiny range from a re-examination of the place of
subalternist histories/stories in critical studies, to 
explorations of writing/orality/ power in two forest communities of
western India, nationalist ideology and historiography, and
subalternity and science, the partition, politics, gender, labour
and Irish "new histories". There is something in it for almost
everyone with an interest in subalternist perspectives.<p>

     In the opener, <b><a name="rana">Ranajit Guha</a></b> 
(re)considers 'The Small Voice
of History': which is an evaluation of where, and how, the
"small" voices could assume mythic proportions of authority,
given a hearing. He names the ideology of nominating authority to
certain events (as "historic") <b><i>statism </i></b>that which authorizes the
dominant values of the state to determine the criteria of the
historic and then examines the inadequacy of this ideology for a
truly Indian historiography, given that it was introduced in
India by the British in the nineteenth century, and suffers from,
a predilection to speak "to us in the commanding voice of the
state which by presuming to nominate the historic for us leaves
us with no choice about our own relation to the past". 
<blockquote><b>Guha
instructs us on how to be a discerning student of history by
making the extra effort to hear, and interact with, the small
voices that are otherwise drowned in the cacophony of statist
commands</b>. </blockquote>
To clarify, he goes to some of the stories that the
small voices tell. To begin, he takes us back to nineteenth-
century Bengal, to a story of sickness and sin, where diseases of
the body (leprosy, asthma, tuberculosis) were equated with
afflictions of the soul, and the colonialist enterprise enlisted
the help of "soap and the Bible" to cure and convert. To continue
much more interestingly, Guha interrogates the statism which
prevails in nationalist and (++Page 6) 
Marxist discourses as well. The referent in both of these is a
state that differs in a significant respect from that in
colonialist writing. The difference is one between power realized
in a well-formed. and well established regime of many years'
standing and power that is yet to actualize; a dream of power".
He then concentrates on the particularly complex articulation of
"statism" within left-nationalist and Marxist writing by re-
examining the documentation of the Telangana Uprising of the
1940's in Andhra Pradesh through the less-heard voices of the
women who participated in the struggle and emerged cheated and
pained from it for the non-realisation of their own liberationist
agendas. Guha sets the tone of the volume by demanding a hearing
for the "despair and determination in woman's voice, the voice of
a defiant subalternity committed to writing its own history".<p>

     <b><a name="ajay">Ajay Skaria</a></b> in "Writing, 
Orality and Power in the Dangs,
Western India, 1800-1920" explores the subalterns' perception of
writing as a weapon of the dominant. He begins by looking at the
notion that non-literate communities perceive the power of
writing as "magical" (Goody, Henige, Levi-Strauss, Guha), part of
a "myth-model which glossed over conquest and domination to focus
on the civilized European whose technologies bedazzled and awed
the colonized primitive." Of course, this myth assumed that
literacy was characteristic of "civilized" societies while
orality was symptomatic of a mentality that is described by
Walter Ong as additive, aggregative, redundant or copious,
traditionalist, empathetic and participatory rather than
objectively distanced, situational rather than abstract.
Derrida, however, has undermined the presuppositions that make
the distinctions between oral and literate mentalities possible,
by arguing that despite the affirmation of the civilizational
role of writing in the West, the spoken word has been privileged;
he calls this "logocentrism. . . nothing but the most original
and powerful ethnocentrism". Skaria explores this Derridian
dictum in the light of his anthropological study of the Dangs in
Western India, and argues that despite its insights, Derrida's is
a deeply problematic approach that ignores the relations of power
involved in writing; the very fact that the meanings of various
forms of writing in the Dangs changed considerably in the course
of a century (with the consolidation of British authority) proves
that earlier perceived notions of the power relations between
oral and written documents were subject to modification by
changing notions of political power and authority. Written
documents -- or simply, books -- often became "embodiments of
fetishized writing", "assertions of the subaltern right to
write", restating, "in the baldest and most moving terms, the
subaltern perception of writing as a desirable, dangerous
instrument of elite domination, one that has to be both
challenged and incorporated."<p>

     In a most involved and very interesting piece of theorizing,
<b><a name="gyan">Gyan Prakash</a></b> reads 
"Science Between the Lines" to posit a theory
about translation as a site for negotiating and realigning
incommensurate colonizer-colonized positions. Starting with Ashis
Nandy's premise that colonial rule produced an enduring dominance
of the ideology of modern science, he makes a departure in order
to "offer another understanding of modemity's historKin colonial
India": he considers, instead, the premise of Rajendralal Mitra,
a nineteenth-century Bengali Orientalist and intellectual, that
the question of the diffusion of western science in British India
could be treated as an issue of translation. Cyan Prakash
appreciates Mitra's recognition of the problem of translating
western science into Indian languages (that it could not be a
"Chinese copy"), because translation was a form of aligning and
realigning non-equivalent languages, and transforming one into
another. This process "exposed science to the contagion of the
subordinated, indigenous culture in which its authority was
represented. There ensued, then, the dissemination, not
dialectic, of western science and indigenous culture from which
neither one nor the other could appear in its'original'
position". This calls, Prakash feels, for placing the discourse
of science in what Walter Benjamin called an "interlinear", or
between the lines, translation: "Translation turns our attention
to the undoing of binaries and borders entailed in the
authorization of the [scientific] discourse, and ithighlights
them as those productive in-between strategies and spacesin which
an authoritative discourse takes shape". If the coming of
science/ modernity to the colonies represented a "second
colonization", GyanPrakash says that it functioned as a
renegotiation, as "a form of translation between the lines"; in
the ensuing struggle between traditional entities and new
scientific knowledge, repressed knowledges and subjects returned
as figures of subalternityto reclaim some ground.<p>

     <b><a name="kama">Kamala Visweswaran</a></b>'s 
essay, "Small Speeches, Subaltern
Gender: Nationalist Ideology and Its Historiography" is 
refreshing in that it interrogates Subaltern Studies even while it
participates in the Collective's ongoing deliberations on
subalternity. She begins by retrieving Spivak's seminal "Can the
Subaltern Speak?" essay from the dusty archives and challenging
it: "What are the places subaltern speech is denied; the ways in
which it is contained; the moments when an act of speech might
puncture, even rupture, official discourse?" Visweswaran's essay
takes as its point of departure the problematics of retrieving
speech, and of constituting certain gendered subjects as
subaltern; she asks how it is that subalternity is inflected by
gender, which is where she feels that the Subalternists have
failed to provide adequate answers, because to them, "either
gender is subsumed under the categories of caste and class, or
gender is seen to mark a social group apart from other subalterns
(which is symptomatic of the formulation' women and the
subaltern')". Visweswaran, by initially distinguishing between
the figure of 'Woman' (universalized, essentialized) as subaltern
and subaltern women, appears to locate her argument in the non-
essentialized subject Her analysis focuses on colonialist
strategies for the containment of women's agency in the
nationalist movement -- identified with the discursive process of
domesticization -- through the reading of records from the Madras
Presidency, in which she discerns dual strategies of containment:
"Women are not admitted as proper subjects of the discourse, but
it does register and seek to contain their agency'. It is in this
moment of oscillation, and tension, that Visweswaran recognizes
the effect where the gendered subaltern is felt -- both Woman as
subaltern, and subaltern women.<p>

     <b><a name="shai">Shail Mayaram</a></b> 
also investigates the politics of speaking and
silencing: in "Speech, Silence and the Making of Partition
Violence in Mewat", she explores the organization, experience and
representation of violence that accompanied the partition of
India, with Mewat in north-eastern Rajasthan as her region of
study. The particular issue that she problematizes is the
relation between speech and silence, and the apparent
constructions of truth that accompany it with reference to
questions of "victim" and "victimization". She distinguishes
between consensual and non-consensual forms of violence; in the
absence of the consent of the victim, the creation of a moral
ideology on the part of the victimizer then (re)constructs the
violence as counter-violence, thereby representing it as
necessary and the self as the (fictive) victim. These processes
are aided by the facts and fictions that are associated with
speech and silence. Mayaram footnotes Lyotard's analyses of the
silent/ silenced victims of Auschwitz in <i>The Differend: Phrases
in Dispute</i> (trnsl. 1988), where he argues that silence surrounds
the (spoken, written) phrases and that silence itself is a
phrase, and exposes the problematic inherent to having faith, as
a historian and political anthropologist, in "records". In
investigating the Mewat records of partition violence, Mayaram
concludes that "writing is the clue to both the representation
and obliteration of violence.. it is counterposed by the lexical
reordering in the speech of victims... [but].. the issue of
speech as ripping silence is, however, not quite as
straightforward. Layers of silence mask both inscription and
speech, and obliterate annihilatory practice."<p>

     The editors, in the preface, have made a startling
revelation, that the essay by 
<b><a name="kanc">Kancha Illaih</a></b> in this volume marks
the first time that the Collective has engaged with contemporary
discussions of Dalitbahujan politics in India. Illaih reiterates
this, in a rather more brusque fashion, at the start of his
essay: "Mainstream historiography has done nothing to incorporate
the Dalitbahujan perspective in the writing of Indian history:
Subaltern Studies is no exception to this". Pointing to an
alarming trend in recent Hindu politics and historiography to
coopt the Dalitbahujan into the fold (as "fallen" Hindus) and
deny them a different and unique history, Illaih in this essay
intends to "make the personal political" by constructing a new
narrative and text for the Dalithahujans. Simply told, the life
that he narrates encompasses an entire history that clearly needs
to be perceived in its separateness from the larger Hindu
("Brahminical") narrative that seeks to swallow it: from birth,
through adolescence and adulthood, from languages, schooling,
food, ideals ("Hindu Ideals and Our Ideals"), caste and power,
gods and goddesses, daily routines and gender divisions, to two
last sections entitled, ominously, "Brahminical Death" and
"Dalitbahujan Death", Illaih's intent is clear and loud, that he
seeks to assert difference. The message certainly cannot be
(dis)missed.<p>

     <b><a name="vive">Vivek Dhareshwar</a></b> 
and <b>R. Srivatsan</b>, in "Rowdy-sheeters": An
Essay on Subalternity and Politics: examine the figure of the
"rowdy" or "lumpen" in contemporary Indian socio-politics, with
particular reference to what the middle-class in India like to
see as "the criminalization of politics". They raise this
question: "If we take the term 'subalternity' as a shorthand for
the critique of various 'norming' and exclusionary narratives,
such as the nation, secularism, citizenship, etc. can one use
that critique to interrogate the everyday practice of
'citizenship' (or 'democracy') that sustain and define our
conception of the public sphere? In other words, can
subalternity, as a critical category and as an approach, help
destabilize existing political identities and conceptualize new
ones?" This is the question that is raised through their analysis
of the "rowdy-sheet", a record that all police stations in the
cities and towns of Andhra Pradesh keep of a rowdy; through
theirinterviews with the police and their conversations (++Page
7) with the "referents" or "potential referents". In turn, the
question behind that of destabilizing existing political
identities is raised: "how to conceive of democratic politics
around the rights of citizenship if the very discourse of
citizenship contains within itself a drive to differentiate , to
double"? There is of course no satisfactory answer, except for
Dhareshwar and Srivatsan to concede that "these concepts --
citizenship, rights -- themselves have a politics; there is, in
other words, a politics of citizenship that is not external to
the forms of power that produces and reproduces the 'rowdy'. . .
if there is an aporia involved in demanding that democratic
politics interrogate our political modernity, then it irreducibly
defines our political present".<p>

     "Suddenly", write <b><a name="susi">Susie Tharu</a></b> 
and <b>Tejaswini Niranjana</b>,
"'women are everywhere". In "Problems for a Contemporary Theory
of Gender", Tharu and Niranjana interrogate this new visibility
of women across the political and social spectrum, and attempt to
understand the problems that have grown along with this
phenomenon in the early 1990s: "a wide range of issues rendered
critical by feminism are now being invested in and annexed by
projects that contain and deflect that initiative. . .the crisis
of feminism is clearly related to the crisis of democracy and
secularism in our times". They investigate the contradictions
that confront gender analysis today, and the relationship of
these contradictions to the gender, caste, class and community
composition of the "subject" in the dominant order. They call for
an investigation and critique of the so-called "humanist"
practices that legitimize bourgeois and patriarchal interests,
also configuring the "subject of feminism". To illustrate their
reading of 1990s feminism as disabled by hegemonic mobilizations,
they analyze the "metonyms" of feminist participation in the
Mandal and Chunduru agitations, and in movements as diverse as
the Hindutva, the anti-arrack, and the procontraceptive-choice;
though the essay concentrates on the disabling effect of
alliances between feminist and other democratic political
initiatives, Tharu and Niranjana hope that this will be "a
crucial first step in the shaping of a feminism capable of a
counter-hegemonic politics adequate to our times."<p>

     One is not sure how or why the 
categorization of <b><a name="davi">David
Lloyd'</a></b>s essay as "Discussion" distinguishes it from the other
eight in the volume but apparently this is in keeping with the
series' overarching scheme. Is there an implied tentativeness
here, in comparison to the rest? Aren't all essays (which is what
Lloyd calls his anyway) discussions of a sort? One is intrigued.
In any case, Lloyd's subject takes subalternity out of South
Asia, into "post-colonialism"at large. His essay, as he says, has
a "threefold agenda": to account for recent shifts-in Irish
historiography that align some of its critical praxis with the
Subaltern school, to explore its implications for Irish cultural
studies particularly in its critique of enlightenment
assumptions, and to engage with such critiques, especially those
from feminist perspectives, as they are practised under the
rubrics of subalternity or post-colonialism. Lloyd begins by
looking at the large body of non-homogenous "revisionist
histories" that have emerged in Ireland in contestation of
nationalist narratives, of agrarian, local, social, class, anti-
imperial and women's movements. Much of the contradiction in the
development of Irish postcolonial identity, says Lloyd, can be
traced to an "ideological necessity by which the state was
constituted around a conservative cultural identity whose
traditionalism conflicts with concepts of abstract individual
rights that are fundamental to the idea of the modem state".
Feminist critiques have questioned both the conservatism of the
Irish states and the presumed conservatism of Irish communities.
Lloyd refers to the constitution of 1937 that explicitly divided
masculine and feminine spheres within cultural and social spaces,
and argues for adequate documentation and analyses of these
spheres, whether seen "merely as effects of colonial damage or as
resources for alternative visions of cultural life... The
consideration that in fact social forms regarded as damaged ...
may nonetheless represent resources for alternative projects, is
fundamental to the possibilities I am seeking to draw from Irish
subaltern historiography".<p>

     Certainly, and expectedly, in this volume, subalterns are
everywhere, and there is nothing sudden or surprising about it
anymore. In fact, the Collective, as it presumably plans its next
volume that will take them into double figures, will need to
guard against the staling effect that is the very doom of
academic endeavour. The Subalternists appear to be caught in a
peculiar bind: that of indispensibility coupled with a kind of
debilitating predictability. And while, there is little else as
energizing as the knowledge that one cannot be done without, the
lurking fear that something akin to the effect of boredom hides
beneath all the glory can be truly enervating. It is clearly time
for the school to interrogate its own praxis (as a couple of
essays in this volume have refreshingly attempted), and to -- forgive
the unfortunate metaphor -- rise above its emergent limitations.<p>
