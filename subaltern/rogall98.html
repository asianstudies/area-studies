<b>In India</b>, as in Britain, 'History from Below' 
had a tremendous impact in the 1970s. In 
particular, the visit of E. P. Thompson to 
the sub-continent in 1976-77 left a widespread 
desire amongst radical historians to emulate his 
work in an Indian context.<p>

This response reflected a number of factors. Just as
elsewhere in the world the late sixties saw a tremendous
radicalisation, against a backdrop of economic and
political crisis. This had its echoes in the new and
expanding universities of India. But the specific
attraction of 'History from Below' was its challenge to
the prevailing orthodoxy. An admixture of Stalinism and
Nationalism dominated historical study, particularly of
the colonial period. Nationalists viewed the anti-colonial
struggle in terms of a 'unitary movement' under the
leadership of the Gandhian Congress. Communist
historians, such as Bipan Chandra, widened the
parameters of 'acceptable nationalism' to include the
'revolutionary terrorists' and the left. Nevertheless both
nationalists and communists shared the assumption that
the mass of Indians were woken to political life by
Gandhi and the rest of the Congress High Command.<p>

However the impact of 'History from Below' collided in
the Indian academy with another import from the west -
post-structuralism and post-modernism. This collision
produced a new and specifically Indian synthesis - the
Subaltern Studies group. A journal of that name first
appeared in <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss01.htm">
1982, edited by Ranajit Guha</a>. The term
<b><i>Subaltern</i></b> was taken from Gramsci's euphemism for the
proletariat in his <b><i>Prison Notebooks</i></b>. However the
Subaltern Studies collective used it as a catch-all term
for all groups they viewed as oppressed - the proletariat,
the peasantry, women, tribal people.<p>

As with Thompson <i>et al</i> they saw their aim as being to
recover the struggles of the poor and the outcast from the
'condescension of posterity' and the grip of 'official' left
intellectuals. The collective focussed on peasant and tribal
struggles, little work being done on urban movements
with the exception of 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss03.htm#dipe">
Dipesh Chakrabarty</a>'s 'Rethinking
Working Class History' on the jute mill workers of
Calcutta. But what was distinctive about their approach
was the argument that these struggles, far from being
creations of what they termed 'elite nationalism', were
independent of it and much more radical. 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss01.htm#gyan">
Gyan Pandy</a>,
for example, in the first issue of the journal demonstrated
convincingly, in a study of the 1921-22 peasant struggle in
Awadh, how Congress, far from initiating the struggle,
had attempted to undermine it because the peasants were
targeting Indian landlords who Congress wished to
incorporate in their pan-Indian alliance against the British.<p>

However the Subalterns weren't simply interested in
illustrating the 'bourgeois' nature of India nationalism.
They argued that movements from below had been
hijacked by elite nationalism and subordinated to the
nationalist project. When they wrote of combating
'grand narratives, it was the 'grand narrative' of 
anti-colonial nationalism they were targeting. Undoubtedly
there was a very important core to their argument -
essentially the 'nationalist leadership' had attempted to
use 'highly controlled' struggles of the Indian masses in
order to confront and then replace the colonial masters.
But the collective's project had an even more ambitious
aim: they wished to reconstruct peasant consciousness
itself, and to demonstrate its autonomy from elite
nationalist thought. In order to do so, they sought out
both new sources and attempted to reread the
traditional archives 'against the grain', all with the aim of
recreating the mental world of the peasant insurgent.<p>

Over time however, the Subalterns began to shift their
ground. The influence of post-modernism and its
offspring 'post-colonial studies' began to take its toll.
Now the central theme of the group's work became not
the hijacking of popular struggles in the interests of an
aspiring Indian bourgeoisie nor the reconstruction of
subaltern consciousness, but the argument that the
whole 'nationalist' project was fundamentally flawed. In
the name of 'progress' and 'modernity', the nationalists, 

[<b>++Page 3</b>] 

after 1947, had imposed an oppressive centralising state
on the 'fragments' that comprise Indian society. So 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss01.htm#part">Partha
Chatterjee</a>, a key figure in the group, argues in 'The
Nation and its Fragments' that secularism and
enlightenment rationalism are simply weapons in the
armoury of the post-colonial state. Similarly Dipesh
Chakrabarty insists that the very notion of a good society
or of universal progress are 'monomanias' that need to be
junked in the name of the 'episodic' and the 'fragment'. It
is in this context that 'community' began to replace
'subaltern' as the focus of the collective's work.
'Community' was now privileged as the key source of
resistance to the new hegemonic power. This has led to a
celebration of local traditions for their own sake. But of
course, in reality communities are not simply centres of
resistance to an intrusive and oppressive state, but also
sources of oppression themselves - of class, gender and
caste.<p>

Such a perspective treads very dangerous ground. The
current BJP-led coalition government trumpets an
exclusivist 'Hindu' nationalism and targets all liberal,
democratic and socialist thought as alien imports. Clearly
the members of 'the collective' loathe this new
majoritarianism, and many of them have spoken out and
campaigned against the Hindu right. Nonetheless their
own championing of indigenous discourse, irrelevant of
its content, and their attacks on Enlightenment thought
as fundamentally oppressive, plays into the hands of those
bigots that now govern India and who wish to create an
authoritarian state based on 'authentic Indian tradition'.<p>
