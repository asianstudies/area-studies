<P>THE ESSAYS COLLECTED in this volume were presented at the Fifth
Subaltern Studies Conference held in Colombo in June 1995, under the
auspices of the Social Scientists Association of Sri Lanka (SSA), the
International Centre for Ethnic Studies, Colombo (ICES), and the
Subaltern Studies Society.</P>

<P>The theme of the conference was 'Community, Gender and Violence': the
present volume is held together by that theme. The essays have taken
their present form after a fair amount of discussion and correspondence
between the contributors. To that extent this volume is a result of
collaborative effort.</P>

<P>We are grateful to Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak for giving us an
expanded written version of the remarks she made at the conference; this
has been included herein as a 'discussion' piece.</P>

<P>Readers of earlier volumes of <I>Subaltern Studies</I> will have
noticed the entry of new subjects and themes into discussions of the
subaltern condition. The Fourth and Fifth Subaltern Studies conferences
held at Hyderabad (1993) and Colombo (1995) foregrounded the theme of
gender. This volume continues that project. We thank the editorial
collective of <I>Subaltern Studies</I> for entrusting us with the
responsibility of editing this volume. We are especially grateful to
Jennifer DeWan for her help in preparing the manuscript for press.

<P><I><B>viii Preface</B></I></P>

<P>We are grateful to SSA and ICES for hosting the conference, and for
their support in bringing out this volume. Additionally, Jayadeva
Uyangoda, in his earlier capacity as Chairman, Sri Lanka Foundation
Institute, was generous in his assistance in hosting the conference.
Kumari Jayawardena's support has been constant and crucial through this
entire process, and we are particularly indebted to her.</P>

<P>We note, finally, with a sense of profound loss and outrage, the
assassination on 29 July 1999, in Colombo, of Neelakanthan Thiru
chelvam, the founder-director of ICES, whose ability to catalyse and
enable intellectual communities was boundless, and whose generous,
gentle and astute scholarly presence was so central to our meetings in
Colombo. In the difficult years ahead, we will miss him more acutely
than words can tell.</P>
