This volume represents Subaltern Studies' longstanding commitment to highlight subaltern themes
in South-Asian history. In recent years, this has meant not only publishing articles on the historical
practices of subaltern groups, but also pressing our inquiries into subalternity beyond conventional
boundaries. Thus, we have expanded our critical focus to include &eacute;lite texts and practices, our
interests have ranged beyond the discipline of history, and we have tackled issues of
contemporary politics and politics of knowledge. These moves have not pleased our critics who
wish us to place the subaltern firmly within a clearly-defined domain. They look unkindly at our
audacity to subject &eacute;ite practices to critical scrutiny, and object to our straying beyond the
strictly defined disciplinary practices of history. On our part, however, we have always conceived
the presence and pressure of subalternity to extend beyond subaltern groups; nothing - not &eacute;lite
practices, state policies, academic disciplines, literary texts, archival sources, language - was
exempt from effects of subalternity. In keeping with this conception, recent volumes have sought
to expand our inquiry, exploring new directions and tackling fresh issues. The present volume
exemplifies this effort.

<p>
The articles by Ishita Banerjee Dube, Indrani Chatterjee, Kaushik Ghosh, Sundar Kaali, and Vijay
Prashad deal with the intractable presence of subalternity in dominant formations and
representations. Banerjee Dube locates subaltern cultural practices on the borderlines of the
religious and the secular; Chatterjee traces the constitution of the gendered subaltern in the slave-
concubinage practised by the representatives of the East India Company during the late eighteenth
century, Ghosh analyzes the place of aboriginality in the construction of the nation; Kaali
describes the subaltern carnivalization of the temple space; and Prashad locates the historical
limits of the nation-state in its turn to coercion as it confronts the Dalits. Christopher Pinney deals
with the contentious presence of 'Indian magical realism', and [<b>++page vi]</b> throws critical light on
the institution of art in colonial India. Sudesh Mishra's contribution resists an easy
characterization, for it navigates between history and memory, and raises questions about how we
should represent the dislocating experience of transplantation and disenfranchisement experienced
by the Indian indentured labourers in Fiji. Can the discipline of history and its forms of writing,
which have traditionally depended upon notions of a located subject, deal adequately with the
experience of dislocation and dispossession? Finally, we have handed over the 'Discussion' section
to Rosemary Sayigh who uses the concept of subalternity in understanding the practices and
conditions of Palestinian women.<p>

It took the collaborative effort of the Subaltern Studies Editorial Collective to produce this
volume, though three members undertook the task of editing it on behalf of the Collective. We
thank Oxford University Press for its continuing support to our project.
