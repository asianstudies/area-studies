<td valign=bottom>iraja felt like crying. It
had been raining all
night. The coal was wet,
the cowdung cakes were soggy and the
kitchen roof leaked. How was she to cook
food for her office-going son and his
working wife?  </td></tr></table>

This same house had a
small kitchen complete with all modern
gadgets. Only, Niraja was prohibited from
entering it. Ratna, her daughter-in-law,
made snacks there for her relatives and
friends. 
She also cooked meals for her little
son. Ratna couldn't trust Niraja. How was 

[<b>++ Page 24</b>] 

an ignorant old woman to know how many
calories a seven-year old child needed? The
other day, Niraja had heard Shubhro say
to Ratna, "Why don't you cook for us as
well? One can't eat the garbage Ma cooks."<p>

 "Why don't you engage a cook?" Ratna
had retorted.<p>

 Shubhro ignored Ratna's words. It was
not economical to engage a cook. He was
already paying instalments towards an
apartment, a colour television, and a
refrigerator. Of course a cook would have
made Niraja's life easier, but ... Ratna was
quite adamant about that. Why shouldn't
Niraja work in the house? Wasn't she
herself going out to earn?<p>

 The house they lived in was old and
crumbling. The address sounded horrible!
17/16/ 3-B, Dharma Thakur Lane. Ratna's
friends were very sympathetic. Imagine
living in that lane and that too with the
in-laws! Only Julie, Ratna's colleague,
found it all very interesting. The twisting
lanes and by-lanes, the heaps of garbage
piled up on the roads ... And who was this
Dharma Thakur?  Any relation of the great
Rabindranath Tagore, Julie wanted to
know.<p>

 "No, no, it is a local deity."<p>

 "Any temples?"<p>

 "A small one. But a fair is held there
every year."<p>

 "Have you been to the fair?"<p>

 "Of course not! It's all so filthy. Dirty
crowds crawling all over... "<p>

 "Filth. Crowds. How exciting!"<p>

 Ratna's parents, too, were quite vocal
about Ratna's plight. Niraja was no fool.
She understood their venom was directed
at her. But she had to keep silent.<p>


 <font size="+4" color="green"><b>S</b></font>omehow 
Niraja managed to light the
fire, then went to attend to Ramapati, her
husband. He was blind and almost stone-deaf.  
But he recognised Niraja's touch. He
could hear faintly if Niraja shouted at the
top of her voice -- something which was
forbidden as long as the two breadwinners
were at home. Niraja guided Ramapati to
the verandah. He would soon call out for
tea and Ratna would get annoyed.<p>

 Niraja made one cup of tea and put the
rice on to cook. Taking two cheap biscuits
from a jar she went to her husband and
silently directed his fingers to the teacup
Ramapati was pleased and nodded his
leonine head, with its shock of grey hair.
Ramapati was now a mere shadow of his 

[<b>++ Page 26</b>] 

former self Niraja left him and went into
the kitchen. Ramapati would be occupied
with the tea and biscuits and the one
cigarette which was his daily ration.<p>

 Just then, Basini, the maid, came from
the market. She prepared the fish for
cooking, washed the dal and cut the
vegetables. Often, to comfort Niraja, she
whispered, "Never saw such a 
daughter-in-law. Making the mother-in-law work
like a hired maid!"<p>

 Niraja kept silent. Ramapati had really
lost his eyes and ears, but Niraja had to
learn to become blind and deaf<p>

 "Basini! Don't forget the washing,
shouted Ratna from her room.<p>

 "No, Boudhi, I won't."<p>

 Basini did everything Ratna asked her
to do. And never failed to tell her, once
every day, "Boudhi, how well you've kept
up your looks! Who can say you have a
seven-year old son!"<p>

 This flattered Ratna and she often gave
Basini her old saris and blouses.<p>

 Soon Ratna left for office without saying
a word to Niraja. Shubhro as a matter of
ritual, called out, "Ma, I'm leaving."<p>

 And Niraja replied, "Yes, son."<p>

<center><img src="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/mahasweta/bayendv.gif" alt="divider">

[<b>++ Page 27</b>]</center><p>

 Niraja made the chapatis and fresh
curry for the evening. After finishing her
chores, she sat with Ramapati.<p>

 "What's the time?" Ramapati shouted.<p>

 "Nine thirty," Niraja replied in the same
loud voice.<p>

 Ramapati walked slowly to the
bathroom. It was a blessing that he could
still bathe himself<p>

 Basini finished cleaning the rooms and
washed Ratna's clothes. Once she used to
wash for the old couple too, but Ratna had
taken strong exception to that.<p>

 "Ma, it's not fair to exploit the poor like
this!"<p>

 "Who is exploiting whom, Ratna?"
Niraja had softly asked.<p>

 "Why should she wash your clothes?
Such coarse heavy cottons! It's not as if
you pay her anything."<p>

 "Where will I get the money for that?"<p>

 "Aren't you getting the rent?"<p>

 A rent of forty rupees from the grocer's
shop, thought Niraja. With that she had
to manage, to buy hair oil, soap, betel
leaves, cigarettes, biscuits, tea, milk,
clothes, medicines -- the list was endless.<p>


<font size="+4" color="green"><b>A</b></font>fter Ramapati 
had retired from 

[<b>++ Page 28</b>] 

government service, he had joined a jute
merchant's office.<p>

 "No vernacular school for Shubhro," he
had said. "Shubhro must have an English
medium education. He has to go up in life.
Then we have to extend the house. Don't
say it is big enough. You need a spacious
kitchen, and some extra rooms. Our son
will marry one day and have children..."<p>

 How proud Niraja had been of her son,
the only child in the neighbourhood to go
to an English medium school. How fluently
he spoke English, how smart his uniform
was, what a big bus came to take him to
school!<p>

 The neighbours would say, "Your one
son is equal to a hundred, Ramapati."<p>

 But Niraja had to learn to be a dumb
spectator from the day Shubhro had
chosen to marry a working girl, through
an advertisement in the paper. He had big
plans and he needed his wife's earnings to
enable him to achieve them. On rare
occasions Shubhro would give Niraja a
ten-rupee note. Once he had even bought
new clothes for his parents for the pujas.<p>


<font size="+4" color="green"><b>R</b></font>amapati had 
always wanted to be a
poet. He often said to Niraja, "If I had not 

[<b>++ Page 29</b>] 

been so busy, who knows, I might have
become a famous poet"<p>

 "Of course you would have."<p>

 "I will, one day. Let Shubhro take
charge of the house, then III write. It won't
do for him to become a poet like me. He
has to be different, successful ... "<p>

 Shubhro had no respect for his father's
poetic aspirations. He was very rude when
he came to know that Ramapati was
planning a third book of poems.<p>

 "Why are you writing another book?"<p>

 "I must dedicate one to you, son."<p>

 "Publish the book if you want to. It's
your money. But I have no sympathy for
books of poems which bring one neither
money nor fame."<p>

 This hurt Ramapati so much that he
gave up writing. He knew he was no great
poet. But it gave him great pleasure when
he was invited to write for the local
magazines. And a feeling of pride to send
his books to the big literary figures of
Bengal. He had preserved their kind
letters of acknowledgment. Shubhro had
robbed him of this simple joy.<p>

 Niraja should have realized that they
would get nothing from their son. They
had lived in the same house with Shubhro, 

[<b>++ Page 30</b>] 

but dwelt in separate worlds. Perhaps if
Shubhro had gone to a Bangla school, had
a modest job, married an ordinary girl ...
Why did women crave for sons? Niraja
wondered.<p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>N</b></font>iraja's former 
maidservant, Malini,
came occasionally to visit her. Malini's son
had a good job and in their house, she was
the mistress, not the daughter-in-law,
Malini boasted.<p>

 Whenever Malini came, Niraja made
her sit with Ramapati, then changed into
a tattered silk sari and went to the temple
of Dharma Thakur. Placing a ten-paise
coin in front of the deity, she prayed,
"Please do not let me die before my
husband. He is so helpless, and there is
no one to care for him. Please be merciful."<p>

 When Niraja returned from the temple,
that day, Malini said, "It's no use crying
over what has happened, Mashima. Had
your son been sympathetic, this same
daughter-in-law would have respected you.
But you had to bring up your son on a
different standard ... You used to cower
before him just because he spoke English!"<p>

[<b>++ Page 31</b>]</center><p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>N</b></font>iraja knew 
that since his childhood,
Shubhro had been a selfish child. His
marriage, too, was the result of his
shrewdness. When at first Ratna had
refused to live in this house, Shubhro had
told her, "Don't be a fool! We can stay here
rent-free. With the money we save, we can
buy a flat somewhere else."<p>

 "What about them?"<p>

 "They will stay here of course. Then
once I inherit the house, I'll sell it."<p>

 Both Niraja and Ramapati knew
exactly why Shubhro was still staying with
them. Strangely, his utter selfishness
failed to hurt Niraja these days. Perhaps
Shubhro was justified in everything he did.
The fault lay with them. Hadn't they
brought him up in a standard above their
own, in order to make him a successful
person? Why should a successful son have
to tolerate his fool of a father and a slave
of a mother.<p>

 One day Ramapati said, "Let's go to the
bank and open a joint account. Let my
pension of two hundred and eleven rupees
accumulate in the bank."<p>

 "Why?"<p>

 "You may have illusions about your son,
I don't. We have to be practical and accept 

[<b>++ Page 32</b>] 

the fact that we have no one else, only each
other."<p>

 "But our son, our Shubhro ..." cried
Niraja.<p>

"Yes, Shubhro. The apple of my eyes."<p>

"Why are you crying?"<p>

 "Why shouldn't I? Shubhro has taught
me such a cruel lesson."<p>

 Soon afterwards Ramapati's eyesight
began to fail. Operations did not help. It
was an advanced case of malignant
glaucoma, the doctors said.<p>

 No one could say that Shubhro was an
unfeeling son. He contributed four
hundred rupees towards household
expenses. "I'll pay the maid's wages and
the electricity bill. You two will have to
manage within the rent you get for your
personal expenses," he told them.<p>

"But how? With the rising prices<p>

"That's not my problem."<p>

 "But ... "<p>

 "Enough, Ma, enough. I've sacrificed
half my life for you. Don't squeeze the
lemon too hard, Ma. It might turn bitter."<p>

What could Niraja do but pray.<p>


<font size="+4" color="green"><b>N</b></font>iraja was 
past seventy Often she felt
a searing pain in her chest. The doctor at 

[<b>++ Page 33</b>] 

the local free clinic advised her, "Go
somewhere for a holiday, eat well, take
some rest."<p>

Niraja stopped going to the doctor.<p>

 One day when she was lying down,
Ramapati asked her, "They have bought a
flat, haven't they?"<p>

Niraja made a sign on his back, "Yes."<p>

"When are they shifting?"<p>

"I don't know."<p>

 The next day Basini told Niraja, "The
new flat is ready for occupation."<p>

"Are you sure?"<p>

 "Of course. She asked me to go with
them," replied Basini.<p>

"Will you go?"
 
"How can I? I can't leave my husband
and two children."<p>

 Niraja felt hurt and humiliated. She
knew that they had bought a flat, that they
would move in soon. But couldn't they have
told her? Why did she have to learn about
it from Basini!<p>

 That evening Niraja went to Shubhro's
room. He seemed embarrassed. "Do you
want to tell me something, Ma?" he asked.<p>

"Basini was saying your flat is ready.;<p>

"Yes, I was going to tell you myself<p>

"You'll be leaving soon, then?"<p>

[<b>++ Page 34</b>]</center><p>

 Ratna replied in a syrupy voice, "That
will depend upon you, Ma!"<p>

 "On me?"<p>

 "You'll have to find out a good day and
arrange for the puja. Otherwise how can
we enter the new house?"<p>

 "I can't go leaving Shubhro's father
behind."<p>

 "He will come for the puja too!"<p>

 "No. It is not safe to leave the house
empty these days."<p>

 As Niraja turned to leave, her grandson
said, "Thakuma, the flat is so big! Three
bedrooms, two bathrooms, 
dining-cum-drawing room, kitchen, and balcony"<p>

 Shubhro said hurriedly, "You both must
come and see it one day. We may leave this
house, Ma, but we'll keep visiting you."<p>

 "Tell your father that," said Niraja.<p>

 The child interrupted, "The name of the
building is Madhumalati, Thakuma."<p>

 "It is a nice name."<p>

 "Ma ..."<p>

 "Yes, Shubhro?"<p>

 "You two ... after we leave..."<p>

 Niraja looked at her son.  An inscrutable
smile hovered about her lips. "Don't worry
about us. We've got the pension. We might
rent out two rooms. I'll manage."<p>

[<b>++ Page 35</b>]</center><p>

 Ratna said. "Han, tenants these. days
pay an advance of thousands of rupees."<p>

"Ma, I'll take care of that."<p>

 Niraja held up a hand, "Don't worry
about us. You'll have your own expenses."<p>

 Niraja left as quietly as she had come.
Shubhro was suddenly moved at the sight
of this woman, his mother. So anaemic, so
thin.<p>

 Ratna pounced on her husband, "Don't
be sentimental, Shubhro! She's not as
helpless as she seems. Didn't you hear she
has already decided to rent out the rooms?"<p>

 Shubhro didn't feel like arguing with
her. He just said, "Ma has become so thin.
Her clothes are shabby and frayed. And I
haven't entered father's room or seen him
for ... how many years, now?"<p>

 "Let's take them with us to the new flat
Baba," the child said.<p>

 Ratna scolded him, "Don't butt in when
elders are speaking." Turning to her
husband, she continued, "Listen, Ma is
right. If the tenant makes a substantial
advance, she can get the house repaired,
and they can stay in comfort... "<p>

 Shubhro was silent for a while. Then
he said, "For the first time I feel like a
criminal. Father is blind, Ma is old. How 

[<b>++ Page 36</b>] 
     
will she manage to get the masons ..."<p>

 "She can if she wants to. My father is
neither blind nor helpless, yet my mother
gets the house repaired."<p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>T</b></font>hat night, lying 
beside her husband,
Niraja tried to draw comfort from the fact
that she wouldn't have to cook the next
day. Wouldn't have to be nervous lest her
words or actions irritate Ratna. Yet she
wept silently, heart-brokenly.<p>

 "Why are you crying, Neeru?" asked
Ramapati gently After countless years,
he drew Niraja close and wiped her eyes.<p>

 "When you lose your eyesight, you
develop an inner vision. I can read you like
the palm of my hand. Didn't I accept my
fate when I lost my eyes? You must, too."<p>

  "You're right ..."<p>

 "So why are you weeping? Try to accept
the fact that Shubhro is leaving. It is s
better to accept what you cannot change. 
Our Shubhro ... wasn't he distant from use
even though he lived here physically?" <p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>S</b></font>hubhro, felt guilty 
leaving his parents 
behind. But their tenant, the grocer, told 
him his nephew was looking for a house.
"I'll see to the repairs and everything," he 

[<b>++ Page 37</b>] 

assured them.<p>

 "Then do it while I'm here," insisted
Shubhro. But Niraja did not agree.<p>

 "How can one rely on his words?" she
said. "What if his nephew refuses to pay
the rent? He is a known ruffian."<p>

 "Ma, we have to trust someone,"
Shubhro sounded exasperated.<p>

 "Leave it to me."<p>

 "Whom will you go to?"<p>

 "Dilip, the doctor in the free clinic is a
nice boy. He wants a house. I'll ask him."<p>

 "Do whatever you want to. But don't
make any commitment which might
embarrass me later," said Shubhro angrily.<p>

 Ramapati came out of his room. "Don't 
use that tone when you talk to your
mother, Shubhro," he said sternly.<p>

 "Why have you come out?"<p>

 "Because the house belongs to me,
hat's why. I heard what you just said.
Later means after our death, isn't it?" He
smiled as a stranger, not as his father.
Even then you will have no cause for
embarrassment. One house, but two
kitchens -- your arrangement. Making
Your mother work like a slave -- your idea.
Saving the rent on the house so that a flat
could be purchased -- your arrangement.  

[<b>++ Page 38</b>] 

When have you ever felt embarrassed?"<p>

 Ramapati could not stop the words that
flowed from his lips. "And don't say that
you're worried about us. It would be a lie,
Your mother failed to recognize the person
you are, but I did. Long ago. How proud of
you I was, my son. How I admired you.
You didn't want to be a failure like me.
You wanted success. Well, you have what
you craved for. Why this bitterness now,
when you are leaving?"<p>

 Shubhro, who always believed that he
was a man above reproach, felt degraded.<p>

 Ramapati continued, "I made my will
long ago. The house goes to your Ma after
I die and to you after her death. So don't
think that you can throw her out soon after
I am gone."<p>

 Shubhro shouted in anger, "What do
you think I am? A beast? A wretch?"<p>

 "No no. You're just one of a generation
whom we, of another generation, do not
know. Since we do not know you, we do
not trust you. How can I say whether you
are a wretch or a beast or a human being?
I simply do not know you."<p>

 Ratna dragged Shubhro to their
bedroom. "Stop shouting. The shame of it!
All the neighbours must have heard you."<p>

[<b>++ Page 39</b>]</center><p>

 Now there was no question of inviting
the old couple to the new flat. Ratna's
mother made all the arrangements,
Shubhro, Ratna and their son touched the
feet of the old couple before they left.
Ramapati mumbled something. Niraja
kept silent.<p>

<font size="+4" color="green"><b>R</b></font>atna was 
overwhelmingly happy.
"How fresh the breeze is here! We won't
 need fans," she exclaimed.<p>

 Try as he might, Shubhro could not
share Ratna's happiness. He stood in the
balcony Yes, it was heavenly. So much of
everything -- sky, air, space.<p>

But a blind old man and a sickly old
woman intervened between Shubhro and
the world around him. He still smarted
from the whiplash he had received.<p>

 Shubhro knew for exactly how long he
had been planning his life without his
parents. But his father? When had he
rejected his only son from his heart?<p>

 Ratna came to the balcony. "What's
wrong?  Are you worried about them? Why?
You have done your best!"<p>

 "You think I am a dutiful son? I've done
ray utmost for them?"<p>

"Of course."<p>

[<b>++ Page 40</b>]</center><p>

 After a pause, he asked, "Ratna, we too
will bring up our son on a standard above
our means, won't we?"<p>

 "Of course we will. Times will be more
tough as he grows up."<p>

 "And will he too force me to say the
same words I forced my father to say
today?"<p>

 Ratna could feel a third, unseen
presence between them. The fear of the
unknown future evoked by Shubhro's
words troubled her. Only for a moment.<p>

 This flat was spacious enough to
accommodate all of them.<p>
