<P><font size="+3"><b>N</b></font>o reason to feel outraged. The death of the don of Indian 
sociologists, M.N. Srinivas, has not caused the slightest ripple. 
The newspapers, most of them, particularly those in the north and 
the east, completely ignored the report of his passing. They had 
other priorities to cater to, such as the cussedness of Australian 
umpires in judging the Indian cricket captain out when, according 
to patriotic viewers, he was not so, or the shenanigans indulged in 
by this or that Yadav leader in the backwoods of Bihar or Uttar 
Pradesh.

<P>About a year ago, a similar silence had greeted the report of P.N.
Haksar's passing. The Haksars and the Srinivases never cared while alive
about the posthumous treatment to be accorded to them by the media.

<P>Men of their ilk were responsible for the stature India has 
reached, in various phases, in the course of the past half century. 
Since, in the views of the New Testament, those five decades were 
a huge waste, personalities who defined that period deserved to be 
treated with, if not contempt, at least indifference.

<P><font size="+3"><b>U</b></font>nfortunately though, there is a little
bit more to it, to wit, the aspect of the progressive spread of
illiteracy. The reference here is not to the 50 per cent of the nation's
members who have been carefully left outside the orbit of even primary
education, and whose numbers rise every year. The darkness encircling
them has been in the nature of a continuum.

<P>Men like Haksar and Srinivas might have tried their best to 
persuade the political establishment to take certain essential 
measures so that the darkness that has turned out to be the 
fate of the nation's majority could be even marginally dispelled. 
Their endeavours ended up in a big zero. The dumb millions were 
obviously altogether unaware of the altruism of which they were 
the intended beneficiaries. 

<P>The free market and even dissemination of knowledge do not always go
together. Infinitely more worrying is the superciliousness noticeable
amongst the so called elite sections of society, which could not care
less whether the man whose death was reported at the bottom of the
seventh column of an inside page had played at some juncture a crucial
role in enhancing, through his singular contributions, the nation's
global image. This defunct individual, they have satisfied themselves,
did not belong to the category that matters, and were not recipients of
any imprimatur of approval from international finance capital.

<P>The latter of course would also include the website crowd and 
those others well versed in the state of the art devices of information 
technology. These devices, installed in affluent houses and bureaus 
in country after country assist the rich set to indulge in financial 
speculations and other relaxations. 

<P>The accent without question is on lightheartedness and even 
more lightheartedness. The attraction of classical music, for 
instance, is on the wane, so too is respect and regard for the 
grand and timeless themes of science and 
philosophy.

<P>Most of the new generation of scientists and technologists, 
including those who have been generous enough not to have 
migrated to the United States from their native lands, have 
rendered themselves into slaves of computers. Theories that 
are not derivatives of computer manipulations receive short 
shrift from today's whiz kids.

<P>Some of them of course also train themselves as economists, 
statisticians and accountants of the first order, ready to further 
and advance the cause of information technology. They have, 
at this moment, a high market demand and are paid fabulous 
salaries. 

<P><font size="+3"><b>W</b></font>hat a tragedy though, they will not have heard of
Srinivas's contributions on the "Sanskritization" of India's
so-called inferior castes, nor will they be familiar with reports of
scores of young Ph.D aspirants who flocked to the country from American
universities in the Fifties and Sixties, nurturing the hope that
Professor Srinivas would recommend for them a village in either nearby
Karnataka or remote Himachal Pradesh; they would then gather the data,
fit in the hypothesis and present Professor Srinivas with a pleasant
bouquet of scholastic wisdom of which he was the inspirer in the first
place.

<P>And then there was the phenomenon of hundreds of Indian 
students trekking from all over the country, not necessarily 
agreeing with him, many calling him a traditionalist or a 
reactionary to his face. He, and they, would enjoy the exchange 
of academic banter. The silence that has greeted the news of 
Srinivas's death suggests that such anecdotes will no longer 
even pass as respectable ancient history. The website crowd will 
consider pastimes of this kind a huge waste of time. Old fogeys 
die, donï¿½t they, so what is biting you? 

<P>We have, it seems, entered once more, with appropriate 
modulations, the realm of two cultures. One of them is constituted 
by the shrinking arena of learning and exchange of ideas within 
small like minded circles in universities and outside. This thin 
assembly of learned individuals do not carry much social weight. 
A numerically vastly superior, supercilious set has taken over the 
main quadrangle of academia. Discussion on literature concentrates 
on brittle English writings in India. 

<P><font size="+3"><b>T</b></font>he native languages are an embarrassment, not to be alluded
to in polite society, a fate that is also likely to overtake Indian
classical music, painting, art and architecture. The appropriate price
has to be paid for globalization. Be reasonable, literature in the
domestic languages have a limited clientele, they are not a patch on the
reach attainable via the global language, English.  The state of the art
technology that has invaded and is invading the ramparts of music, arts,
sculpture and architecture will similarly render the traditional
discourses into irrelevance.  A bonfire will be made of our heritage.
That appears to be the agenda for at least the next 50 years.

<P>What happens beyond that point of time belongs to the 
realm of pure speculation. National pride may conceivably 
regroup itself. It is however bound to encounter fierce 
resistance, even from within the country. Transformation 
of the external circumstances may nonetheless help the 
process. Once that begins to happen, native-born geniuses 
will not have to migrate to the milieu of an alien culture 
in order to make a decent sort of living. What do you know, 
maybe a young Ph.D aspirant, sitting at his website, in 
Lucknow or Hyderabad, will come across references to a 
20th century Indian scholar, M. N. Srinivas, who had 
done pioneering work on the historiography of sociology. 

<P>The scholar's interest aroused, he may seek further 
counsel from a bunch of eminences from the university 
faculties at Minnesota or Wisconsin. M. N. Srinivas will 
receive recognition as a valid historical figure once these 
probes and searches are completed. Srinivas, if he were 
around, would have enjoyed the joke. The Sanskritization 
of sociology studies courtesy the website: is that not a 
destiny even the gods will come to adore? &nbsp;
