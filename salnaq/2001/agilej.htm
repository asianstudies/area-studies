  <p class=MsoNormal><b>A Story of the Origins of the book</b><a name=origins></a><br>
  By <b>Lotus Stack</b>, Curator of Textiles, Minneapolis Institute of Art </p>
  <p>Isn't it funny how an innocent phonecall or a seemingly innocuous letter can
  balloon into an enormous project. It has happened to me on a few occasions
  but I can only think of one situation when I, in perfect good faith, was the
  perpetrator of such a communication. </p>
  <p>It all began in 1993, I was president of the Textile Society of America
  and we had decided that the summer issue of the organization's newsletter
  should be dedicated to the development and dissemination of an annual textile
  bibliography. Although the organizational responsibility for this project
  fell to the TSA publications chair, the entire board pitched in to help. </p>
  <p>As some of you know my initial historic textile love focused on Indian
  textiles. A fellow enthusiast of the subject is Don Johnson, a former Textile
  Council Board member and Curator of the Ames Library of South Asia at the
  University of Minnesota. If you were in my position, wouldn't Don be the
  first person you would ask to become involved in a short bibliography
  project? For him it should only take a few hours to cite a hundred or so
  entries. My call to him to participate in such a noble project, was made with
  a totally guilt-free conscience! </p>
  <p>Little did I know, this call proved to be one of those instances which led
  to more and more work and over the next few years my conscience began to
  absolutely drip with guilt! I think Don, who willingly agreed to participate
  in the project, was a bit innocent, too. Being Don, the project had to be
  done well and of course that meant he had to make sure that all citations
  would be really accurate. Maintaining standards requires checking and checking
  and rechecking! The files turned out to be tremendously rich and it was soon
  realized that even a few hundred citations couldn't do justice to the
  subject. </p>
  <p>This story has a happy ending and I no longer feel at all guilty, only
  extremely gratified that the textile field now has an excellent new tool
  available for the study of South Asian textiles. Don's herculean efforts have
  manifested themselves in the form of a book which is about 300 pages and
  deals with the subjects of history, techniques, and materials, but also
  includes detailed references to religious associations, ethnic groups, and
  noted specialists of the field. I was particularly pleased to see a section
  dealing with special publication formats such as the Indian Census
  publications and Gazetteers as well as museum and gallery catalogues, all of
  which contain such excellent information but often are a very time consuming
  challenge to access for specific information. </p>
  <p>I'm sure you all worked hard during the holiday season and now deserve
  some self indulgence. Follow my example. Buy the book. Curl up in a
  comfortable chair and discover how truly multifaced South Asian textiles
  really are. Truly, Don's effort excites the textile lover's imagination and
  I'm encouraging indulgence. If you have a serious need to know something
  specific about textiles from this part of the world, this book is a dream
  come true. </p>

  <p><b>Author Donald J<a name=post></a>ohnson's Post-script</b> </p>
  <p>Alan and Phil asked if I would try and give a few more personal remarks
  about the experience of working on <b><i>Agile hands and creative</i></b>
  minds in addition to Lotus Stack's delightful review. </p>
  <p>Like all special projects undertaken by librarians with South Asia
  interests, using our collections in depth was a great learning experience. In
  this case searching for information on textiles and clothing in the multitude
  of census of India publications and gazetteers proved to be most educational.
  Using Frank Campbell's 1899 Index catalogue of Indian official publications
  in the Library, British Museum and the 1930 Royal Empire Society Subject
  catalogue of the library amply demonstrated how much we have evolved in
  providing access to information. Identifying research and writings on
  textiles which appeared in the last two hundred and fifty years provided
  insights into the trends, issues and concerns of scholars. </p>
  <p>The helpfulness of fellow librarians concerned with South Asia in
  providing assistance and verifying seemingly impossible bibliographic
  citations regarding library holdings yet again demonstrated how collegial we
  are. In this regard I would especially like to thank Irene Joshi whose
  interest in South Asian textiles and costumes was a great support and
  encouragement to me particularly during those down times when one
  contemplates the usefulness of the project. Her e-mails drawing my attention
  to titles, exhibitions, or authors made certain work continued. Irene's
  interest also resulted in discussions of the ever-evolving work whenever we
  met at the Madison South Asia conferences or AAS. </p>
  <p>Searching for works in the libraries of the universities of Chicago,
  Hawaii, and Michigan as well as the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. and
  the Calico Museum Library in Ahmedabad, India, allowed me to get a
  researcher's perception of them. Thus although much time and effort went into
  <b><i>Agile hands and creative minds</i></b> I was much enriched in the
  process. Now for the next project . . . </p>
