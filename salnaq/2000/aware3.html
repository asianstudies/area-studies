<FONT FACE="Palatino,Arial Narrow"><P>As more and 
more publishers, journal aggregators, vendors, and 
societies/associations, etc. establish a presence on 
the Internet, they use technology (i.e., alerting or 
TOC notices) to promote products and services 
directly to end users.  Signing up for various 
notification services can benefit faculty and students 
with well-defined interests, whether scholarly or 
recreational, and also promote use of a library�s full 
text materials and general collections.  Encouraging 
incoming graduate students and new faculty to try 
such services eases them into the use of different 
online systems.  The following list is an initial effort 
to identify sites with utility for South Asian Studies 
and is adapted from an outreach presentation.  Comments 
and/or additions should be directed to Merry Burlingham (<a href="mailto:merry@mail.utexas.edu">merry@mail.utexas.edu</a>)

Select titles such as Modern Asian Studies and receive

this database can be searched by journal title and subject 
to view tables-of-contents by individual issue; it includes approx. 
13,000 journal titles.  Try this if a specific title doesn�t seem 
to be included in any other TOC service.

you expect relevant material to appear, check the
