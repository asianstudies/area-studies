<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>Tibetan medicine is a unique and holistic system which has been continuously
practiced and preserved since many centuries. It deals with the
inner (i.e. the subtle body and mind) as well as the external environment.
Tibetan medicine identifies ignorance (<i>ma rig pa</i>) as the cause of all the
disorders (disease), generalised into three main disorders of <i>rlung, mkhris
pa</i> and <i>bad kan</i>, collectively known as three humours. Our body, according
to Tibetan medicine is made of five cosmic elements (earth, water, fire,
wind and space).

<p>According to Tibetan medicine, all our life processes (activities) are carried out by
the three humours (wind, bile and phlegm). These three humours carry various
essences to all parts of our body (physiological functions), when they are in state
of dynamic harmony, but become the cause of disorder when they are in
disharmony. Each of the three hum ours has five sub-divisions e.g. the five types
of <i>rlung</i> are life sustaining, ascending or upward moving, pervasive, fire like or
fire accompanying and downward moving <i>rlung</i>. The five types of <i>mkhris pa</i> are
digestive, determining, complexion clearing, sight seeing and colour transforming
<i>mkhris pa</i>. The five types of <i>bad kan</i> are supporting, decomposing, experiencing,
satisfying and connective. Although each of these have their specific functions,
but in general, <i>rlung</i> helps in functioning of mind and body, respiration, urination,
defection, uterine contraction, menstrual blood flow, spitting, swallowing, speech
and the clear perceptions of five sense organs. <i>mKhris pa</i> carries out the digestive
processes, assimilation, promotes bodily heat, clear body complexion, the sense of
courage and determination. <i>Bad kan</i> is responsible for the firmness of body,
stability of mind, inducing sleep, correcting bodily joints, generating the sense of
patience and lubrication of the body. 

<p>Elemental theory states that all the natural phenomena, either macro cosmic or
micro-cosmic are composed of five elements. Universe (macro cosmic) is formed
of these elements and our body, the micro-cosmic, is also made up of them. In
case of the living beings, these elements are not just the static physio-physical
elements, but it deals more with the inherent  energetical functions, for example
the element fire does not mean the burning fire inside the body, but its inherent
qualities of bringing warmth and strength in the body. These five cosmic elements
play important role in the development of baby in the womb of the mother. Earth
element is responsible for the formation of muscle tissue, bones and sense

[<b>++ Page 90 THE TIBET JOURNAL</b>]  

of smell, overall solidification of the body. Water elements are responsible
for the formation of blood, body fluids, and sense of taste, aggregation of
different parts of the body together. Fire element is responsible for the
body temperature, complexion, sense of sight, and maturation of the
growing embryo. Air element helps in the development of the body, sense
and touch. Space element creates body cavities, sense of hearing and
provides space for the proper development of the body. 

<p>According to Tibetan medicine, sperm and ovum contain three humours (wind,
bile, phlegm) and subtle qualities of five elements. Unlike the Tibetan system, the
western science states that sperm and ovum carry the genetic blue print of life, the
cell, which contains chromosomes (XX in female and XY in male) and the genetic
material (DNA, RNA, and nucleic acid).

<p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF EMBRYO ACCORDING TO TIBETAN MEDICINE
</b>
<p>Tibetan medical texts explain the essentials of four major factors for a
successful conception. These four factors are:

<p>1. The healthy qualities of sperm and ovum (sperm should be white,
heavy, sweet and frothy and the healthy ovum should be dark
reddish colour like of the hare's blood and that leaves no stain on
the clothes)<br>
2.  The conglomeration of five cosmic elements<br>
3.  The consciousness of being wandering in the intermediate world
(<i>bardo</i>)<br>
4.  Karmic relationship between the consciousness and the parents.

<p><b>GESTATION PERIOD</b>

<p>The development of the fetus begins receiving its nutrition through
umbilical cord connected to the naval of the fetus and placenta. The development
of the fetus takes place in 38 weeks (26 weeks) plus ten days (nine months and six
days).

<p>1ST MONTH<br>
1st week  The sperm and ovum mingle.<br>
2nd week  The mixture then turns into semi-fluid.<br>
3rd week  Solidifies into curd like fluid<br>
4th week  then it becomes round, oval or oblong formation, which determines the
sex of the embryo into male, female and hermaphrodite respectively.<br>
[++NOTE <b>Page 91</b>]

<p>SIGNS OF CONCEPTION

<p>Heaviness of the belly, weakness, loss of appetite, yawning, stretching of
the limbs, laziness, developing breasts and appetite for sour foods and
drinks and various things due to fetus. During this period, the wishes of
the pregnant woman should not be restricted as this could harm the baby.

<p>2ND MONTH (FISH PHASE)<br>
5th week  the navel of the fetus itself forms<br>
6th week  the life channels form<br>
7th week  the shape of eyes form<br>
8th week  the shape of head forms<br>
9th week  upper and lower trunk of the body (abdomen) form

<p>3RD MONTH<br>
10th week the shape of two shoulders and two hips form<br>
11th week forms the shape of the nine orifices<br>
12th week the shape of five vital organs form<br>
13th week the shape of six hollow organs form

<p>4TH MONTH (TURTLE PHASE)<br>
14th week the shape of two arms and two thighs form<br>
15th week the shape of forearms and legs form<br>
16th week the shape of fingers and toes form<br>
17th week the formation of internal and external connecting vessels

<p>5TH MONTH<br>
18th week  formation of the muscles and fatty tissues<br>
19th week  formation of tendons and ligaments<br>
20th week  formation of bones and bone marrow<br>
21st week   formation of the outer skin

<p>6TH MONTH<br>
22nd week opening of the nine orifices of the body<br>
23rd week  growing of the hair, body hairs and nails<br>
24th week  full development of the vital and hollow organsl
25th week  movement of wind energy in the body system<br>
26th week  mind clearly recollects the past

<p>7TH MONTH<br>
27th-30th week  all the body systems increase very fast. 
This time fetus sucks the placenta<br>

[<b>++Page 92 </b>THE TIBET JOURNAL]

<p>8TH MONTH (PIG PHASE)<br>
31st-35th
week  all the body systems increase very fast. This time fetus sucks the placenta.

<p>9TH MONTH<br>
36th week  five feelings of distress rise in the mind of fetus (unclean environment,
stingy, prison like, dark and a feeling to come out from the womb)<br>
37th week  feels like turning up side down.<br>
38th week  turns up side down by the action of downward moving wind.

<p><b>DIFFERENCES IN EXPLANATIONS</b> (TIBETAN VERSUS WESTERN
MEDICINE)

<p>Tibetan medicine explains that the development of embryo in the womb
of the mother takes place by the action of different rlung energies. West
ern medicine states that development occurs by cell division, and the
action of certain hormones.

<p>Tibetan medical text states that different organs of the body have their
specific sources whereas the western medicine holds different views.

<p>Delivery of the baby by the action of downward moving wind is ex-
plained as uterine contraction due to hormonal effects that leads to the
delivery of the baby according to western science.

<p>One of the chief differences is that Tibetan medicine explains in tune to
Buddhist viewpoint of life such as the law of karma, consciousness from
the intermediate world. The presence of the consciousness is the main
thing without which the conception will remain unsuccessful. But, the
western medicine doesn't explain the role of karmic forces and the
consciousness in child conception.
