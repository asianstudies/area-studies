<P>INTRODUCTION [by Alex McKay]</P>

<P>The arrival of the Younghusband mission in Tibet irrevocably changed
Tibetan society, forcing the Tibetan state to confront Western modernity
in all of its manifestations; social, economic, political, scientific,
and technological. The implications and consequences of that encounter
have yet to be fully analysed and located in Tibetan historiography. To
an extent, Tibet remains a <I>Prisoner of Shangri-La</I>, as Donald
Lopez put it. But specific deconstructions of that image of Mythos Tibet
over the last decade or more<A NAME="fn1"></A><A
HREF="#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>, allied to the more nuanced
understandings of Tibetan society provided, in the main, by historical
anthropologists<A NAME="fn2"></A><A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>,
have enabled us to reconstruct Tibet's past with new perspectives
removed from both the colonial and the immediate political context of
the Sino-Tibetan issue.</P>

<P>Tibetan studies has, however, tended to largely float free of
academic models, both regional and theoretical, and to situate Tibetan
studies more firmly within these models is clearly desirable if we are
to break free of the prison of Mythos Tibet in our reconstruction of
Tibet's past. This is not without some risk. Theoretical approaches
deriving from post-modernism have, all too often in the field of Asian
studies, resulted in works which are not historical, are primarily
concerned with Western self-reflection rather than Asian subject, and
are expressed in an elitist and largely incomprehensible jargon. But
Tibetan studies has almost entirely escaped these excesses through its
practitioners' close connection to Tibetan society, both in its textual
and physical manifestations.</P>

<P>The collection of essays in this special edition of the <I>Tibet
Journal</I> therefore endeavors to advance our consideration of the
Tibetan encounter with modernity by examining aspects of this issue in
the wider context, and to link Tibetan studies more closely to on-going
research in the social sciences through the inclusion of more reflective
and theoretical work as we ask ourselves; what follows Tibet as
Shangri-La?</P>

<P>We open with Peter Hansen's paper questioning why the 'Subaltern
studies' movement has not been embraced by Tibetan studies, despite its
being so influential in South Asian studies since the first volume of
essays with that title appeared in 1982. The Subaltern studies movement
has attempted to develop new approaches to the history of non-elite
groups in South Asian society, and the absence of such work in Tibetan
studies is notable, with Tibetan histories overwhelmingly focused on
elite political and religious perspectives. Yet, as Hansen notes,
through its representations of 'subaltern' perspectives, including those
of Tibetans in India today 'Subaltern studies... has the potential to
destabilize the myths of Tibet promulgated by both Chinese and Tibetan
national] sins'.</P>

<P>Given that the focus of such work is on Tibet and Tibetans, and
avoids both Western self-reflection and simplistic domination-resistance
models, such an approach potentially offers significant new
understandings of Tibetan history, understandings that reflect the
complexities and fragmentations that exist beneath the monolithic
constructions of competing mythologies. Within South Asian Studies, the
Subaltern studies movement has demonstrated that Indic history need not
be approached primarily through the study of religious texts-texts
accessible only to minority elite groups and representing only narrow
historical perspectives.  That more balanced approach is sorely needed
in the field of Tibetan studies.</P>

<P>4 THE TIBET JOURNAL</P>

<P>The essay by Jane Ardley then questions the extent to which Gandhian
models of resistance are applicable to the Tibetan issue. His Holiness
the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet has explicitly adopted Gandhian ideas,
ideas for which there are not necessarily precedents in Tibetan history.
Historically, invasions of Tibet--by Nepali, British, Chinese, Mongol
and other armies, have been met by armed resistance from Tibetan forces.
Indeed, as is now well-known, armed Tibetan resistance to Communist
China continued until the early 1970s. But as part of the modern Tibetan
occupation of the moral high ground vis-&agrave;-vis China, non-violent
resistance has become increasingly synonymous with the Tibetan
struggle.</P>

<P>Crucial to the Gandhian resistance model is an opponent who
recognises and responds to the suffering of the resisting group. But
there is precious little evidence of any such humanity existing among
the ruling elite of China. Indeed power now appears to be their only
ideology, and all other ideologies, of national, universal ('human
rights'), or religious form, are only acceptable in as much as they can
be used by the Chinese leadership to retain their power.  Gandhi
recognised that such an opponent could not be influenced by non-violence
resistance. The present Dalai Lama, however, relies on the Gandhian
model. We can only hope that his enlightened stance will bear fruit; at
the time of writing, however, scarcely a blossom may be seen.</P>

<P>Carole McGranahan's article confronts the problem of locating Tibet
within political models dominated by the Western Nation-State formation.
Focusing on the Sino-Tibetan frontier zone in the 20th century, she
examines the diplomatic attempts to resolve the question of where the
boundary lay within that zone. She then presents three models of the
Tibetan state; the <I>colonial model</I> associated with Western
definitions of Nation-Statehood; a <I>united model</I> that embraces
traditional Tibetan understandings of their realm, and a <I>contested
model</I> that recognises the historically fluid nature of the Tibetan
state.</P>

<P>Though an outstanding example of the problems arising from colonial
constructions of territory, Tibet is far from alone in that difficulty.
Large sections of the globe, not least in Africa, are wracked with
conflicts arising to some extent because of the 'lines on a map' drawn
by the imperial powers in their own interests. If these problems are to
be resolved, new concepts of statehood and political administration must
be developed, and indeed are being developed in both Europe and Central
Asia.</P>

<P>My own contribution seeks to demonstrate that we may, from one
perspective, situate the Younghusband mission within the process of
British-Indian imperial frontier expansion. The opening of Tibet was not
a unique event, but a well-rehearsed process with numerous precedents.
Crucial to this understanding is the later 19th century movement from a
process of direct territorial annexation to one in which the aim was the
gaining of a controlling influence, a much cheaper and less
diplomatically problematic policy. The search for a stable frontier
began the imperial process of expansion, but the realisation that
British interests could be served more economically by bringing its
neighbours into the British sphere of interest-meaning, in practice, the
gaining of a controlling influence over the neighbouring government,
particularly in regard to its foreign relations, meant that the search
ended with British India establishing a cordon of "Buffer states" around
its borders. Relations were established with the elites of those Buffer
states, which were forced to enter into treaty relations giving the
British a controlling influence over them.</P>

<P ALIGN="right">INTRODUCTION 5</P>

<P>While Buffer states such as Nepal, Tibet, and Afghanistan exerted a
considerable degree of autonomy, and, at times, independence, they did
serve to protect the frontiers of British India from invasion by hostile
empires. We can, therefore, compare the process by which the British
gained control over Tibet with the process by which they gained control
over the various other states in the Indian sub-continent and in the
Himalayas. It was only in the linear sense that Tibet represented the
culmination of the process of expansion.</P>

<P>This paper does represent a slight refinement in the position
represented by my work <I>Tibet and the British Raj</I> [1997], in that
it suggests that the idea of a "Russian threat" to India was
deliberately promoted and used by the "Forward school" of British policy
in order to gain influence over Tibet, and that constructing a Russian
threat to Tibet required developing an existing, and extreme, argument
of a n actual military threat to the North-western frontier of India,
into a threat to the northeastern frontier by 'subversion' rather than
invasion. In retrospect, the "Forward" school's belief in the actuality
of a Russian threat may have been genuine, but it was
McCarthy-esque.</P>

<P>I have previously argued that the extreme manifestation ofthe
"Forward" policy in the post- Younghusband era occurred in 1923-24, when
British efforts to maintain their controlling influence over Tibet
resulted in the Sikkim Political Officer, Major F.M. Bailey, attempting
to promote a <I>coup d'etat</I> in Lhasa with the aim of removing the
Dalai Lama from secular (although not religious) power and replacing him
with the formidable figure of Tsarong Shape.<A NAME="fn3"></A><A
HREF="#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>In making that argument I Concluded that Bailey's agent in Lhasa was
S. W. Laden La, one ofthe two intermediaries upon whom lay enormous
responsibility for communicating between the British and Tibetan elites
during much of the period from 1905 to the early 1930s. Laden La, a
Buddhist of Sikkimese origin, was, by the 1920s, a senior police officer
in Darjeeling, and was used by the British Political Officers in Sikkim
on a number of missions to the Tibetan leadership.</P>

<P>Nicholas Rhodes, known for his studies of Asian numismatics, and his
wife Dekyi, a granddaughter of Laden La, have strongly objected to my
conclusion that Laden La was involved in this alleged coup, and their
response forms the next article here. The Rhodes argue that the
allegations of Laden La's involvement originated with Lungshar, a
Tibetan official who rose to prominence under the 13th Dalai Lama as a
supporter of the anti-modernism faction within Tibet's ruling elites and
they argue that these were repeated by others as a consequence of
Himalayan family rivalries.</P>

<P>While regretting that the Darjeeling family of Laden La proved
unavailable during my research there, I must emphasise that my
contention has been that the then Major F.M. Bailey planned and promoted
the affair under consideration and thatif I am correct--Laden La was
only following Bailey's orders, as would have been his duty. It may well
be that ultimately Bailey's plans failed because of Buddhist loyalties
to the Dalai Lama by the main players. Certainly the documentary
evidence in the Rhodes possession (to which they have kindly given me
access) appears to confirm that Laden La did genuinely suffer a nervous
breakdown after these events, contrary to my previous contention. That
lie was re-employed by the British after that can only confirm his high
standing in the upper echelons of the imperial government.</P>

<P>6 THE TIBET JOURNAL</P>

<P>While it is for the reader to judge between the various
interpretations of events in Lhasa in the 1920s, the Rhodes article
serves an additional purpose. It provides a valuable portrait of one of
the imperial intermediaries. Those indigenous officials whose duty was
to interpret imperial understandings to local elites--and vice
versa--came to form a zophisticated and cosmopolitan class with a
considerable influence on the history of British India. That their
importance has been forgotten is a regrettable consequence of historical
agendas--imperial and nationalist--that have not been served by studies
of such significant figures whose loyalty was to a British India.</P>

<P>The final paper, a list of European and Japanese travellers to Lhasa,
is one that has existed for a number of years. It was originally
prepared by James Cooper for the Tibet Society in the U.K. in the I980s,
and has since been referred to by several authors. It is published here
for the first time and provides an authoritative list of those
travellers who reached Lhasa before the Chinese invasion in 1950.</P>
