<font size="+1"><b><i>Mandala: The Sacred Circle of Vajrabhairava</i>, 
written and narrated by Daniel Cozort. Featuring
monks of the Namgyal Monastery. Distributed by Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, 1997,
videocassette, 60 min. US$ 29.95.</b></font><p>

To the sound of a lone flute, a hand, in close-up, meticulously places sand within sketched-in
outlines. In a series of slow dissolves, the rich, pure colors of the mandala rise to the surface.
Throughout this initial visual sequence of the video <i>Mandala: The Sacred Circle of
Vajrabhairava</i> -- presented without any dialogue -- we are introduced to the wonder and the precision
of the sand mandala.<p>

     After a fade-to-black, the title card is displayed and we suddenly see the whole space from
a high-angle shot. Now we are aware of the mandala, not just as a series of exquisite details, but
as a circle, as a symbol of the cosmos and of psychic integration. Called by the narrator "the
world's richest religious symbol," the mandala is viewed through multiple perspectives in this
serious, almost devotional, short video.<p>

     In his 1969 <i>The Theory and Practice of the Mandala</i>, Giuseppe Tucci describes the
mandala. as "a geometric projection of the world reduced to an essential pattern" (p.25) and,
more emotionally, as a guide to help pass through "the stormy troubled sea of <i>maya</i> in which [the
neophyte] is shipwrecked" (p.21). In their book on the mandala, Jose and Miriam Arguelles write
of "the center as symbolic of the eternal potential" (p.12). The video offers additional definitions:
"visual scriptures," "ideal models for personal transformation," "a materialization of the monk's
contemplative wisdom."<p>

     The relatively stable camera used throughout the video helps to reinforce the sense of calm
(although a greater effect might have been achieved with more variety in pacing and in the vocal
quality of the narrator). Statements by the interviewed monks tend to be informative, if somewhat
overly didactic. In these interviews (in which the interviewer is never shown), the monks help
define phrases like "subtle consciousness," and they stress the role of imagination and
visualization. More playfully, one monk comments on how visitors seem to like the sound of the
funnel used for dispensing the sand, and so he would always try to produce an especially energetic
sound to accompany his work in public.<p>

     The viewer is offered a computerized rendering of the sand mandala as a three-
dimensional "palace" resting on a lotus of 64 petals. (This imaginative computer artwork, linking
traditional form and modem technology, was made by the late Ven. Pema Losang Chogyen, to
whom the project is dedicated.) We enter into it; [+<b>+Page 153</b>] 

we fly over it; it whirls off into space. In contrast to the stunning visuals, the narrative speaks of
emptiness and transcendence as the true framework for this fragile and transitory artform (which
was, somewhat paradoxically, originally made out of semi-precious stones). A frequent reliance
on a slow pan up of the paintings makes good use of the camera's ability to pass smoothly over
details as it allows the viewer to contemplate the varied iconography of the deities.<p>

     A large segment of the video is devoted to the construction of a sand mandala of the
Buddha Vajrabhairava (the Diamond Terrifier) in the Trout Gallery of the Dickinson College
campus in Pennsylvania. We catch glimpses of the process from the opening ceremonies to the
dismantling of the finished work.<p>

     Recently, in Cleveland, three monks assigned to the Dalai Lama's Western branch of his
personal monastery in Ithaca, N.Y. spent several weeks constructing a Kalachakra. sand mandala.
on a raised dais in the center of the spacious "Armour Court" (so named because that space
formerly housed an impressive collection of shiny armour from the European Middle Ages).
Curious onlookers crowded around as the three monks patiently filled in the carefully drawn
outlines of the mandala. What had seemed at first a rather small design acquired depth as the
highly saturated colors of the sand were added, day by day. Returning week after week to see the
transformations became a source of delight. One of the monks who was more proficient in English
took time to quietly answer questions from those who stood around on the four sides of the
working monks. At the end of the process, the sands were swept into an urn and poured into the
lagoon in the Fine Arts Garden on the south side of the museum. (As the narrator of the video
reminded, "the beauty is in its creation, not in its duration, and in its effect on
onlookers.")<p>

     Not only was a beautiful work of art and devotion temporarily added to the splendid
Cleveland Museum of Art collection, there was also a sense of growing ease and familiarity with
Tibetan traditions. In the same way, the video <i>Mandala: 
The Sacred Circle of Vajrabhairava</i> offers
both beauty and a sense of familiarity that will help bring "the exotic" closer home. Until the
1980s, Tibetan sand mandalas were rarely seen by outsiders to the tradition, but in 1988 His
Holiness the Dalai Lama permitted a more widespread construction of the mandala to help
promote a greater awareness of its message.<p>

     As the credits roll at the close of the video <i>Mandala</i>, we see monks and onlookers leaving
the Trout Gallery, walking toward the camera, to pour the sand into flowing water. One monk
stops to help a little girl down a steep step.<p>

     This video is an effective addition to a growing library of films on Tibet, including <i>Satya:
A Prayer for the Enemy</i> (dir. Ellen Bruno, 1993), <i>Lung ta: The Forgotten Tibet</i> (dir. Marie Jaoul
de Poncheville and Franz-Christophe Giercke, 1991, narrated by Richard Gere), <i>The
Reincarnation of Khensur Rinpoche</i> (dir. Tenzing Sonam and Ritu Sarin, 1991), <i>A Song for Tibet</i> 
(dir. Anne Henderson, 1991), and <i>Mustang: The Hidden Kingdom</i> (1994, narrated by Harrison
Ford). It is especially effective, not only as a careful presentation of the philosophies behind the
art form, but also as a documentation of how such forms can travel successfully across cultures.<p>
