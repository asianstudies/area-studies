     The Tibetan Collection at the University of Virginia is one of the
most complete collections in the world.  The collection serves to
support a world-renowned <b>teaching and research program </b>in Tibetan
Buddhism in the Religious Studies Department at the masters and doctoral
level.  The program involves three main faculty, several lecturers,
visiting scholars, and about two dozen graduate students.<p>

     The core of the research collection consists of about 3,000
<b>pecha volumes</b> containing about 8,000 titles of texts.  Since the
late 1960s, these and other Tibetan materials have been systematically
acquired, identified, marked, shelved, and circulated to Tibetan
scholars.  The pecha represent about 40% of the Tibetan collection.
They are in the format of single sheets, block-printed on both sides of
various qualities of paper, some bound, but most unbound.  Another 40%
are relatively uniform-size reprints of these pecha, bound as codexes.
The remaining 20% are in Western book format.  The collection currently
resides in the Alderman Library basement.  In addition there are a large
number of secondary materials on Tibet in the Alderman stacks.  Also in
the Periodical Reading Room (3rd floor) are current issues of several
Tibetan journals, while bound earlier issues are in the stacks.<p>

     A Tibetan Reference Room provides several <b>reference tools</b> to
aid in the identification of texts and other information.  These tools
consist of dictionaries, encyclopedias, guides, catalogs,
bibliographies, tables of contents (dkar chags), and other search and
reference tools.  The Room currently is on the second floor of Alderman
Library.<p>

     Most of the titles of the Tibetan pecha volumes and other materials
are <b>accessible</b> in VIRGO, the University of Virginia's online
catalog system.  All of these materials may be searched, identified, and
circulated to Tibetan scholars for their research.<p>

     Most of the materials in the Tibetan collection are in the
<b>Tibetan language </b>and script.  Since nearly all of it was
published in India, Bhutan, and Nepal, with extremely small press runs,
this material is virtually irreplaceable, out of print, and unique.<p>

     The Tibetan materials cover a full range of <b>subjects </b>of
Tibetan literature, consisting primarily of books on the many forms of
Tibetan religion, mostly <b>Buddhism</b>.  Other subjects covered
include Tibetan language, Sanskrit language, and the principles of
Tibetan Buddhist art and iconography.<p>
