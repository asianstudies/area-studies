<p>Tibetan Software and Buddhist Texts contains the works of Padma Karpo Translation Committee made for the study of the Tibetan language. There are Tibetan word-processors, the finest Tibetan typefaces available, Tibetan-English dictionaries, and Tibetan Buddhist texts with special reader software. The software products make a complete suite of tools for Tibetan language study and set a new standard in Tibetan Buddhist studies. The dictionaries are used by the University of Virginia library and Tibetan studies program.

<p>The software, fonts, dictionaries, and texts are the work of Lotsawa Tony Duff, founder and director of the Padma Karpo Translation Committee. Lotsawa Tony is an Australian who has been studying and practising Tibetan Buddhism since his arrival in Nepal in 1973. He has studied and practised extensively with three of the four main traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. In the 1970's he was a monk and one of the founders of Chenrezig Institute for Western Culture, under Lama Yeshe and Geshe Lodan. In the 1980's he moved to the U.S.A. to be a student of the incomparable Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. Tony was well known as a scholar and teacher in that community and remains a member of the Nalanda Translation Committee. In the 1990's he moved to Nepal to continue his work as a translator. Working with Tsoknyi Rinpoche, the son of Tulku Ugyen, he established the Drukpa Kagyu Heritage Project and the Padma Karpo Translation Committee. The Drukpa Kagyu Heritage Project was founded to preserve and reprint the works of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage; the project's work was very successful and became a model for nearly every Tibetan text preservation project at the time. The Padma Karpo Translation Committee translates Kagyu and Nyingma materials in general and Tony travels regularly with Tsoknyi Rinpoche and other teachers, translating Dzogchen and other teachings around the world. It has been Tony's vision that the translation committee could produce authentic materials for translating and studying the Tibetan language and provide them together with fine software to make them useful electronically. This CD is one of several which present the results of that vision.
