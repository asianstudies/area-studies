<p><b>Editorial</b></p>

<p>Himani Bannerji's lead article in the current issue of Social Scientist, which
is the text of her keynote address to the Annual Conference of Socialist Scholars in Canada, explores the connection between contemporary neoliberal capitalism and the increased violence against women. To establish this connection, which liberal-feminists tend to ignore, she uses a non-positivist methodology that sees society in its totality, and social categories as developing in an interconnected manner rather than being linked through binary cause-effect relationships admitting of proof.</p>

<p>Within this perspective she underscores several features of contemporary neoliberal capitalism. One is the massive primitive accumulation of capital that is taking place, which consists not only in the grabbing of land and other natural resources through dispossessing people, but also of large-scale human trafficking, of the forcible expropriation and commoditization of bodies that become objects of 'consumption'. The violence of this process of primitive accumulation is also reflected in the violence unleashed against women's bodies.</p>

<p>Another significant change that has occurred is that factory production, which brought together large numbers of workers and made collective actions possible through the formation of what Marx had called 'combinations', is increasingly giving way to 'informalisation' and subcontracting. Associated with these new forms is the development of a fractured individualist consciousness rather than a working class outlook. And this permeates not just those producers but society in general, and makes it easier to convert despondency at one's predicament into anger against others, rather than against the system.</p>

<p>The paper by S. Irfan Habib, which is his Presidential Address to the Contemporary Indian History section of the Indian History Congress at Malda in December 2015, underscores certain core values of our freedom struggle, among which were democracy, a respect for cultural, linguistic and religious diversity, and modernist thinking that encouraged the development as much of science as of scientific attitudes among the people. These values, shared by many stalwarts, were expressed quintessentially in the speeches and writings of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was thus not just an idiosyncratic individual but the prime representative of a tradition. The attack on Nehru these days thus constitutes an attack on this entire legacy. In its place what is</p>

<p><i><b>Social Scientist</b></i>, p. 2</p>

<p>being advanced is a narrow majoritarianism whose exponents represent an altogether different legacy unconnected with the freedom struggle.</p>

<p>Sunny Kumar's paper sees in the colonial administration's use of the term 'terrorists' for the revolutionaries, and 'political' activists for the non-violent nationalists, an attempt to present the former in an unfavourable light, as a de-politicised group worthy of little sympathy. The 'terrorist' epithet,  significantly, was rejected by Bhagat Singh who emphasised the primacy of political work, and the need for the military department of the party to back political work rather than engage in mere 'bomb-throwing'.</p>

<p>Manas Dutta's paper shows, through the experience of the Paraiyans of the Madras Presidency, how recruitment into the army could help in improving the social standing of an oppressed caste. The improvement in the status of the Paraiyans, however, was undermined at a later date as the three Presidency armies were merged and the common recruitment into this merged army preferred the so-called 'martial races' of northern India over groups like the Paraiyans.</p>

<p>Sabyasachi Bhattacharya's note is the written-up version of a speech that he was to deliver, but could not, at a convention on 'The Assault on Thought' that was organised by Sahmat on 20 March 2016 in Delhi, in the context of the ongoing attack on institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the University of Hyderabad by the Hindutva elements. The note raises, as one would expect from the author, very important points about the strategy of struggle against these elements, which need to be deeply thought about.</p>

<p>The recent months have snatched away from us a number of outstanding Left thinkers. Three such stalwarts that we have lost are Asok Sen, Randhir Singh and Ellen Meiksins Wood. We pay our homage to them through obituaries written by Meenakshi Gopinath, Dhananjay Rai, Maidul Islam and Vijay Prashad.</p>
