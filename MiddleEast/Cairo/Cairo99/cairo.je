to place subscriptions, but not deposit additional funds for "new serials
titles" we will look at the participant's balance and the price of the
serial before we order the title for you. At any rate, we will keep you
informed about the status for your request for a new serial title. 
Status: OR

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but as you know, the
Revolving Fund legislation mandates a "no credit" policy.

I can be reached at lmul@loc.gov should  you have any questions or
comments.

Thank you.

Jim,
  Another funding issue.  After you and Phil get back, the 
three of us will need to sit down and figure out what to do 
about the $17,000 Cairo bill that we are paying only $4000 
of right now.
                Gary

	Lynda,

	I left 4 LC bills next to your office door on Friday afternoon;
they are due to be paid by the first of October.

	I left notes along with the signed bills explaining the payments,
and they are listed below.  We will be able to pay for 3 of the 4 bills in
full; but not for the Cairo bill; only $4,000 of its $17,711 at this time
(and it is highly possible that no more funds will be found to make further
payments).  I discussed these bills and payments with Gary on Friday
afternoon.  We are at least trying to cover some of the Cairo serials with
the $4,000.

	These LC payments are a little complicated; and if you are in on
Saturday, you are welcome to give me a call if you wish to (at 979-6112).
I return to work Tues. the 5th Oct.

	--Philip Mc
