Dear MECAP:


The 31st Cairo International Book Fair will be held from January 26th  to
February 6th 1999. As per our usual practice, we will furnish you e-mail
lists of Book Fair offerings. But due to our need for fast processing,
these may or may not be arranged by country. They will however, be numbered
BF1, BF2, etc.

Participants who wish any of these titles MUST respond within two days, so
that we may purchase these materials while they are still available.

Your cooperation is appreciated. Thank you.
