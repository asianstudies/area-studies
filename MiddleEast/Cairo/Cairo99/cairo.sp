Philip McEldowney:

I was informed by Mr. James Gentner at the Library of Congress in
Washington that the University of Virginia has not yet paid the FY99 bill
for participating in MECAP.  I would appreciate it if you would make
arrangements for payment as soon as possible.

LC/Cairo's financial statements for October 31 indicate insufficient funds
in your Shipping sub account.  We are not permitted to transfer money from
the other subsections of your account where you are currently showing
positive balances.

Since we are prohibited  by law from extending credit to participants we
have temporarily suspended shipping all materials until payment for FY99 is
received in Washington.

Please feel free to contact me at the number listed below. You may also
contact James Gentner at 202-707-5252 and by email at jgen@loc.gov.

Sincerely yours,

	Connie, 

	I hope the process for the payments for the LC Overseas bills was 
started at least last week, including the $6,252 payment for the (Cairo)
Middle East LC bill.

	I received the notice below from the Cairo office that they are
suspending shipping until they have received payment for this year's bill.  

	Thanks - just wanted to check and let you know.  --Philip Mc

	Laila Mulgaokar,

	Thank you for your email about the U of Virginia's LC Cairo bill.
I made arrangements with the Acquisitions Department in our library to
start procedures for payments of the LC bills on the 9th of Nov. 1998.
Locally these financial procedures of the State of Virginia may take up to
a month.

	Please be assured that the $6,252 payment from the Un. of Virginia
has been arranged to be paid for our LC Cairo bill, and should be in the LC
Disbursing Office within a month. On receipt of that please resume shipment
of materials.

	Thank you,

	Philip McEldowney, Librarian
	Selector for Middle East and South Asian materials
