Dear MECAP:


The 31st Cairo International Book Fair will be held from January 26th  to
February 6th 1999. As per our usual practice, we will furnish you e-mail
lists of Book Fair offerings. But due to our need for fast processing,
these may or may not be arranged by country. They will however, be numbered
BF1, BF2, etc.

Participants who wish any of these titles MUST respond within two days, so
that we may purchase these materials while they are still available.

Your cooperation is appreciated. Thank you.

I understand that it would be easier for participants to read the book
lists were we to limit each list to one country.  However, in light of the
amount of time and effort it would take, it would not be cost-effective for
us to do so.

Sorry!

	James Gentner,

	If you can fax us a Supplemental Bill for Materials for $1335 today
(Friday 7 May 1999), to 804-924-3143, we can try to process this bill
today, paying on our local fund Class-of-61-6-45274 to be used for purchase
of materials in the Arabic language.

	If unable today, then next week, please.  Connie Kelly, our UVa
Library expert in many financial aspects of materials purchases is retire as
of her last day today after 30 years of work here.  Much easier to do this
today, if possible, than next week without her.

	Thanks.  --Philip McEldowney

Subject: Status of MECAP account

Philip:

Greetings! I need to alert you to the current status of U.Va's MECAP 
account and ask your advice about how we should proceed:

On the MECAP Quarterly Statement (as of March 30) the balance in your 
Materials sub account was $1,652.

However, in April we processed all responses you sent us for Non-Book 
Fair lists, viz., Book Lists 99/1-72. As of today, after deducting all 
payments and obligations for monographs and serials, your balance is 
$828. But $1,063 is ear marked for payment to vendors for serials as and 
when they are received in Cairo during the rest of the fiscal year. This 
leaves a projected negative balance of $235 for monographs for the rest 
of the year.

Your responses to Book lists 99/73-90 total an additional $180; we have 
not yet placed orders for these requests.

Please let me know your preference:

1. Would you like to replenish your Materials sub account? In which case 
James Gentner will send you a Supplemental Bill for Materials for $1,335 
which is an amount based on your requests for monographs from non-Cairo 
Book Fair Lists for the first half of this fiscal year. This amount 
should carry you through September 1999, while leaving sufficient funds 
to cover your serials orders. The Supplemental Bill will also include 
charges for Overhead, Shipping and Binding.

OR

2. Would you like us to immediately stop processing your requests for 
monographs? In which case, later in the year we might have to do a 
Supplemental Bill in the event that the projected negative balance 
becomes an actual negative balance, which as you know is not allowed 
under the Revolving Fund legislation.

Please feel free to ask for further clarifications of this email.

Phil,

	Today I got the rest of the numbers for your MECAP supplementary bill.  In
addition to materials, which I faxed you on Friday, you will need to add
$60 for binding and $1,000 for shipping to make it through the year.

	I'm mailing you the "rest" of the supplementary bill this afternoon unless
you'd rather that I fax it to you.  Let me know if you want it faxed.

	Sorry for this delay, but I got your request after Cairo had closed for
the weekend.

James.
