	Gentner, Mulgaokar, etc.

	Please note that I requested James Gentner to cover the serials
shortfall of the MECAP bill, with moneys from the India fund.

	This should answer the question of full payment of the serials
portion of the MECAP bill.  At present, UVa has decided not to pay any
portion of the bill for monographs; and we are meeting in early December to
consider that situation.
