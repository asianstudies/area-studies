	James,

	Four of us connected with Middle East library acquisitions met this
Thrus (19 May 1999) morning to discuss the supplemental bills for Cairo
materials.  All areas of collection at the Univeristy of Virginia are tight
and we are facing a flat materials budget for the coming year, starting in
June 1999, which means all areas and selectors must reduce their budgets by
4%.  At this point it is difficult to find any further amounts in present
our materials budget for Cairo payments or to justify further supplemental
payment.

	I give this as explanation that we are forced to request that you
use any payments from us so far this 1998/99 year (including the $1,896
which was just sent to you as the first Supplement), targeting for paying
for serials, binding, and shipments.  If there remains any amount, please
use that for monographs, but immediately stop processing our requests for
monographs as soon as our money runs out, notifying us at that time.  We
would still like to receive the Cairo Email title lists even when we stop
monographic ordering.

	Please respond if there are any problems with this request.

	Thanks.  --Philip McEldowney, Selector for Middle East materials

Do I need to copy Cairo's office on this, or will you do that?

Philip and James:

Cairo will have no problems adjusting to U Va's requirements.  The payment
for the first supplemental bill ($1896) will be spread between serials,
binding and shipping and (as funds allow) monograph purchases.
Philip, we can process all your requests for monographs through List No. 90.
After that we will spend $$ on monographs very cautiously and will let you
know when we stop purchasing them.

We will of course, continue to email you the book lists and will hold
requests you send to us after we stop purchasing monographs.

Best wishes

Laila

I am going to cancel. The subscriptions manager has sent nasty messages 
to many of us. I don't like her attitude and no periodical is worth 
this aggravation. I think we should all boycott the journal. The level 
is also not what it was years ago.

Thanks for letting us know about this, Laila.

Therefore your current subscription to Al-Adab journal through LOC/Cairo has been $20.00 a year, plus overhead ($28 a year) and shipping from Beirut to your institution via Cairo.  The international subscription price offered by the publisher is $100 for institutions, including postage.

Should you decide to continue your subscription, I am sorry to say that it will now cost you $13 per issue, plus $18 overhead, plus shipping from Beirut to Cairo and Cairo to your institution. Or you might want to place your subscription directly with the publisher, or another vendor.

David, Philip, Midhat, Ali, Philip and Mr. S. Taha:
 =20
Correction to my email yesterday re: your subscription to Al-Adab =
journal.

I apologize for an error I made in my hasty email on this subject.  =
Under the terms proposed by the Subscriptions Manager, the new price of =
every issue of Al-Adab would be $13 PLUS $5.46 overhead (NOT "plus $18 =
overhead" as I had written!).

Judging by the two responses I have already received (from David and =
Ali) I don't think this makes a difference in your decision to cancel =
subscriptions with LOC/Cairo, does it?

Sorry -- I'll know better next time not to send out emails quoting =
prices without the Budget Analyst reviewing them first!!!!

Is there a way that we can limit each list to one country and not mixing
publications from several countries into one list even if it takes a
little longer to send the lists out.

Thanks.
Midhat.
