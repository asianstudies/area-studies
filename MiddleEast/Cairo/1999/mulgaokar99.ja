	James Gentner,

	If you can fax us a Supplemental Bill for Materials for $1335 today
(Friday 7 May 1999), to 804-924-3143, we can try to process this bill
today, paying on our local fund Class-of-61-6-45274 to be used for purchase
of materials in the Arabic language.

	If unable today, then next week, please.  Connie Kelly, our UVa
Library expert in many financial aspects of materials purchases is retire as
of her last day today after 30 years of work here.  Much easier to do this
today, if possible, than next week without her.

	Thanks.  --Philip McEldowney

Subject: Status of MECAP account

Philip:

Greetings! I need to alert you to the current status of U.Va's MECAP 
account and ask your advice about how we should proceed:

On the MECAP Quarterly Statement (as of March 30) the balance in your 
Materials sub account was $1,652.

However, in April we processed all responses you sent us for Non-Book 
Fair lists, viz., Book Lists 99/1-72. As of today, after deducting all 
payments and obligations for monographs and serials, your balance is 
$828. But $1,063 is ear marked for payment to vendors for serials as and 
when they are received in Cairo during the rest of the fiscal year. This 
leaves a projected negative balance of $235 for monographs for the rest 
of the year.

Your responses to Book lists 99/73-90 total an additional $180; we have 
not yet placed orders for these requests.

Please let me know your preference:

1. Would you like to replenish your Materials sub account? In which case 
James Gentner will send you a Supplemental Bill for Materials for $1,335 
which is an amount based on your requests for monographs from non-Cairo 
Book Fair Lists for the first half of this fiscal year. This amount 
should carry you through September 1999, while leaving sufficient funds 
to cover your serials orders. The Supplemental Bill will also include 
charges for Overhead, Shipping and Binding.

OR

2. Would you like us to immediately stop processing your requests for 
monographs? In which case, later in the year we might have to do a 
Supplemental Bill in the event that the projected negative balance 
becomes an actual negative balance, which as you know is not allowed 
under the Revolving Fund legislation.

Please feel free to ask for further clarifications of this email.
