	Dear sirs, 

	The University of Virginia would like to inquire about acquiring
two books directly from you: if you have them in stock; what they might
cost to us; and what it might cost to have them shipped air mail versus
regular shipping; and what type of payment [pre-paid, credit card] format
we might be able to use to quickly pay for these titles?

The two titles are 

1) Sawaie, Mohammed. Azmat al-mustalah al-'Arabi fi al-qarn al-tasi' 'ashar

Subject: Cairo Bill
Status: ORS

	How to get $13,500 for the Cairo Bill to you the fastest?  so that
UVa can start selecting monographs right away? and might it still be
possible to unsubscribe to some Cairo serials we have been getting and see
about subscribing to some others we want to get?

	I can make a xerox of this years Cairo bill for the U of Virginia,
modify it and put in the $13,500; and copies on to you.  Even if I try
hard, UVa may not be able to process this faster than one month.  Or you
might xerox a copy of a new, revised Cairo bill to me, which would indicate
a $13,500 payment from us.

	The Selectors committee has finally met and determined to provide
$13,500 for the remainder of the Cairo bill.  If you recall, at first (in
Sep/Oct) UVa sent in $4000 to try to ensure that serials would continue;
Cairo and you reported back to me that another $1,??? was needed to cover
that serials payment, and you transfered that $1,??? from India to Cairo to
cover the Cairo serials.  The $13,500 is just for this year and is based on
the stipulation that I/Middle East professors have to come up with a 4%
serials reduction or around $168.   

	The ME language professors came up with about 15 titles worth
around $800 which they said could be cut; but we are checking with the
political science and history depts to see if the lang profs decisions are
okay with them, etc.  Plus the lang profs want some 7 other titles, which
we are not getting, for us to start subscribing to.  So, we need to get
that unsubscribe information to you and Cairo, plus indentify and find out
if we can subscribe to some new titles.  Sometime.  Sooner the better - is
there a serials person I can email in Cairo?

	So, suggestions on how to get the $13,500 to you fastest? when to
start monographic title ordering fastest? and unsubscribe/subscribe to some
serials titles fastest?

Philip,

	The fastest way to get the $13,500 would be for you to write a personal check and then be reimbursed by the State of Virginia.  Not sound business practice I fear, so what are the other alternatives?

	I will send you a supplemental bill for $13,500.  I can fax you a copy as well as mail.  Is your fax still:  804-924-1431?

	Concerning serial cuts:  once you send a list of serial cancelations to either Laila Mulgaokar, the field director (lmul@loc.gov), or Ms. Muna Abdoon, the of serials in the Cairo office (mabd@loc.gov) that may free up some cash for monographs.  (I copy Laila, Muna, and Rabab Mohi el Din the had of Administration in Cairo on this in the hopes that they will be able to give you current fiscal data.)

	As soon as you have $$ in your account that is not obligated, you may select monographs.  Perhaps Cairo can give you better advise vis-à-vis selection based on your current financial situation.

James.

        James and others,

        Fax number is still correct at 804-924-1431; please send
supplemental bill.

        Thanks - I'll keep working on this - sending money in on the
supplemental bill; listing serials (about 10/12) to unsubscribe and find
out about some others (about 4/5) to possibly subscribe to; and holding
back on monographic selection until learning there is money available for
UVa to do so.
