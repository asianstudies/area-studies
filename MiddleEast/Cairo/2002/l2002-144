Dear MECAP participants:


This is to inform you that the 34rd Cairo International Book Fair is going

Book Fair.  It is expected to receive your requests within 24 hours. This
will help us acquire your copy in a timely fashion. The sequence of these
lists will be different than the regular one. These lists will be marked as
