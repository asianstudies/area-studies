MECAP participants:

LOC-Cairo has acquired copies of  video tapes of programs aired by the
Qatari al-Jazirah channel.  The first batch was 105 tapes, and we have
recently received another 85 tapes.

These are available in PAL or NTSC; $20.50 for PAL and $29.00 for NTSC.

At the MECAP meeting during the MELA conference I distributed some copies of
lists of the first 105, but I ran out of copies.  They have since been
mailed to those who requested them from me at that time.

If you would like us to mail you a list so that you may make your selections
and fax the list back to us, please email us at cairo@loc.gov.
