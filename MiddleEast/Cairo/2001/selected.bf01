Subject: Re: Hamoodur Rahman
Status: ORS

	Sajjad,

	You can get your own personal copy of the full-text of the THE
HAMOODUR RAHMAN REPORT, by going to this site

http://www.india-today.com/ntoday/extra/71war/

and downloading or printing off the Report's sections, found near the
bottom of the web page.

	Also and otherwise, I am requesting Library of Congress Islamabad
to acquire a copy of this REPORT for the University of Virginia library,
but that may take 6 or so months before we receive our print copy.

	--Philip Mc
