Field Director has sent MECAP participants an e-mail saying that due to
the implementation of a new Y2K compatible system ( IFOS ), certain
procedures had to be changed.

Out of these is the inability to add the cost of each item in your
packing list In USD for each shipment.  We will therefore have to
temporarily put the cost of each item in the original currency.  Please
consult daily newspapers for the exchange rate.  This is a temporarily
modification.  We will have the ability to put USD price in a few
months.


With our best wishes,
Rabab Mohi al-Din
