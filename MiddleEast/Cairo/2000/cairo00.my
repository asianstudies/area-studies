Dear MECAP participants:

With regret, I am announcing my resignation from the Cairo Office of the
Library of Congress, after eight years of service.  The reason is that I am
moving to Canada during the second week of May.

It has been a pleasure to work with MECAP; I will miss it and the Library of
Congress. Thank you for having been participants in our Cooperative
Acquisitions Program!

Muna Abdoon
Head, Serials Section
LOC-Cairo

MECAP participants:

You must have received Muna Abdoon's email informing you that she is leaving
LOC-Cairo this week.  We at LC-Cairo and LC-Washington are very sorry to see
her go.  She has been of invaluable help in building our serials collection
and in administering the serials segment of MECAP.  We wish her all success
in her new life in our neighbour to the north!

Please send all emails regarding serials, binding or shipping to
cairo@loc.gov.  Please do not send any emails to Muna's email, mabd@loc.gov;
her email account has been cancelled.  Of course, feel free to contact me at
lmul@loc.gov.

We are currently in the process of advertising the vacancy created by Muna's
resignation and will inform you when we have appointed a new Head of the
Serials Section.
