Phil,

When you think of it, you might tell the folks in Cairo that I 
find the new arrangement of the e-mail selection lists very 
helpful.  Since my faculty member is only interested in certain 
countries in the Middle East, it saves me lots of time to have 
lists confined to one country which is named in the subject of 
the e-mail.  I can just delete the messages for countries not of 
interest without even reading them.
