Dear Mr. McEldowney:

This is in reference to your e-mail concering the ordering of two titles
proposed by Leila Books. I would like to inform you that there is no
problem of acquiring these titles for U. of Virgina . The Cairo Office
charge for these titles are :

- Rawdat al madaris .....14 vols  ($ 141)
- al Qamus al Nubi... ( $ 5)    

Also I would like to inform you that there is no problem for LC Cairo to
ship Dr. Sawai's copy of  Rawdat al madaris to him through Cairo Office. We
will charge U. of Virginia the cost of shipping through the MECAP program.
Could you please inform Leila Books to deliver Dr Sawai's copy to Cairo
office to be mailed  together with Virginia's copy.
 

If you need any other requests, please do not hesitate to inform us

Best regards.
