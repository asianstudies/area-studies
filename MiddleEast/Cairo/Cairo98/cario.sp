Mecap participants:

Security measures are being taken by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo following
the bombings in Nairobi and Dar-al-Salaam.  Therefore three offices located
on the periphery of the Embassy compound (of which LOC is one) are being
temporarily closed,  pending further instructions from Washington. 
LOC/Cairo will be closed at least for the rest of today (Sunday) and on
Monday.  

I will be in touch as soon as we are open. Current plans are to move us
temporarily from the periphery into any available spaces in the other two
buildings, such as conference rooms, etc.  Operations will no doubt be
seriously affected, at least for the time being.
