<b><font size="+3">T</font>he family of one of Iran's foremost 
novelists and short story writers has given his working
library to U.Va. Consisting of 1020 items, the library of Sadeq Chubak contains many Persian
literary masterpieces and several rare Persian works. According to Farzaneh Milani, associate
professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Languages and Cultures and Studies in Women and
Gender, researchers will now be able to study and understand Chubak's own literary tastes and
views on Persian  literature from his extensive annotations in the margins of numerous books in
the collection. "Mr. Chubak was one of Iran's literary. giants, considered by many one of the
country's foremost authors. To have his personal collection at U.Va. is like a gift from above,"
said Milani.<p>

Milani first met the Chubaks when they moved to America from Iran 21 years ago. This
long-term friendship was instrumental in the family's decision to give the library to U.Va. after
Chubak's death in July 1998. "This collection will 
become a valued addition to Persian studies at U.Va.," said Milani,
"and it is my hope that the resultant expansion in our library holdings will be followed by the
expansion of our program."<p>

The University Library is grateful to Mrs. Ghodsi Chubak and her sons Roozbeh and Babak
Chubak for their very generous gift that significantly expands the library resources available to
Persian scholars.</b></td></tr>
